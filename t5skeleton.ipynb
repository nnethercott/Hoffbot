The questions and the topics are as follows. Firstly, price for coffee. Is there a guaranteed premium or price? How much is it? Then labour practices. What do these certifications consider essential to prevent things like exploitation? And then farming practices. What is considered important in how plants are treated or soil is treated? Then eligibility, who actually can attain or get that certification? And then the cost. Who is on the hook for the cost of the certification? Who pays? And finally, we're gonna touch on how these certifications impact coffee quality. I'm not gonna lie. This video was tricky to make.\n"

      "I have three options for you at three different price points. And just so you know, this cost about 25 pounds, this cost 50 pounds, and this cost 70 pounds. All of them are cheaper than any decent espresso machine that might provide you some sort of steam with which you could steam milk. So while they do involve spending some money, they involve spending less money. Let's start with this one because it might look a little bit familiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "So as we luxuriate here on this roof, I think I should probably wrap up and tell you which I think is the best portable espresso maker, 'cause it's not a simple question to answer. Because I would say probably the best espresso maker is maybe the Flair, but it's not the best portable espresso maker. And I would say the best sort of most portable thing is clearly the Wacaco Picopresso, but it needs a few things, it needs a few tweaks, it needs a new basket to be better. But out of the box, it's not the best espresso maker. The Handpresso is just out, I didn't have a good time at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you interact with it, it feels lightweight in comparison to everything else. Now, in terms of what I would recommend. Well, firstly, if you have one of these machines, I'm not sure I'd recommend upgrading to another machine from this group. Maybe if you have a Rocket and you're frustrated by not being able to play with temperature easily, then you might consider something like this and upgrade but really you're not going to see a substantial improvement in your espresso, right? If you've got one of these, you've got a great capable machine. If you get those pressures dialed in, temperatures dialed in, you are very capable of producing incredibly good espresso if you've got a good grind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like this is an entertaining replica of an espresso machine. But it gets better. It gets better. It's a two in one. Turn it around.\n",
      "\n",
      "It brews pretty good espresso. We'll not talk endlessly about pressure but it's kind of fine. I think it's a good value machine, I think at the price point it's out-competing something like the Rocket Appartamento. Here, I feel like this was a difficult bracket for this machine. It's well-built, it looks good, but it does not have the feature set of a cheaper machine or a very slightly more expensive one, right? It sort of sits at a difficult price point where I'm not sure, you know, other than maybe I've got a great deal on it or I have great support and after sales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, this originally came out back in 2008, and it's much cheaper, it's only Â£60. Which is still a decent amount of money, but it's cheap for an espresso machine. The solution is kind of interesting. You basically take a bicycle pump and put a coffee bit on it. Instead of just pumping the whole time though, what you do is you build pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a difficult problem to solve to make that anywhere. And I know the idea is out there that somehow espresso is the pinnacle of coffee brewing. It's not, but it is delicious. And so I guess it's worth doing this comparison. And so today, we have four brewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you tended to see historically was when you need espresso you had a dedicated espresso style grinder. And this is a pretty good example. It's a bit of a jump in price because you've got a more substantial motor in there and this is about I think 350 pounds which is some pretty serious money. Now this is designed really to be a dedicated espresso grinder. And it's a little bit more traditional in its design, which means it's got a large hopper on top to again, hold a big bag of coffee beans in there and grind what you need when you need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ooh-ah. Looks good. Is this worth it? Is it worth the time to hunt for it? Is it worth gambling on the equipment? Is it worth the effort? Is it worth the stress? Is it worth the money? That's good espresso, that is good espresso, like, yes, it could be better, yes it's, you know, I could get the extraction up a little bit, yes, I would like a little bit more temp control, yes, yes, yes, but that's a good shot, that's tasty, it's sweet, it's complex, it's pretty well extracted, the question is, is it worth it, would I recommend going through this process? If you are comfortable with the risk involved, then I would say, yeah, maybe go for it, chances are secondhand equipment will have problems, you might not have something as extreme as having a leak inside the machine like we did, or having a broken connector to fix, and if you're not comfortable with that stuff, then honestly stay away, save your money, buy something where you're gonna get support, a warranty, backup service, all of those things, they really matter when you're spending hundreds of pounds, but if you are comfortable getting inside an espresso machine, if you're careful and you know what you're doing, then, yeah, I would say go for it. I would say, on the grinder front that I paid about Â£100 for this, and I'm reasonably impressed for the money, like, I don't think I've seen a grinder this cheap do espresso as well as this does, I'm not saying it's a flawless grinder, it definitely, you know, has some issues with distribution, it retains a lot of ground coffee inside of it, it's not particularly intuitive to use, but it is relatively capable when it comes to grinding for espresso and that impresses me for the money..\n",
      "\n",
      "Some new ideas, potential for exploration, really feels centered around espresso more than anything else. Though it is, as I said, very very capable around filter coffee. $2,600. It's enjoyable but it's big. Now I don't get to keep this unit.\n",
