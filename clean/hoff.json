{"data": [{"title": "Coffee Certifications Explained", "text": "This video is sponsored by Notion. Today we're going to explain coffee certifications By the end of this video you'll understand what each certification offers, and how it might be useful to you in how you want to buy coffee. Certifications in coffee are really pretty popular. They're widespread, but most of us, and that's myself included, would struggle really to understand what, exactly, each of these different certifications offer, aside from being maybe \"more sustainable\" or maybe \"less ethically dubious\". We're gonna look at the following certifications today. First up, Fairtrade International. That's the most common Fairtrade mark, and it gets confusing 'cause there's a number of organizations that use the name Fair Trade, like Fair Trade USA, but they're different and separate. And we'll put some links down below about other Fair Trade marks. Then Rainforest Alliance, which merged with another certification called UTZ back in 2018. We're gonna talk about organic coffee, interestingly, the only legally-defined and enforced certification out there. And then Smithsonian Bird Friendly coffee which is, I think, very interesting. Now, in addition to these certifications I wanted to look a couple of very large companies' buying programs, and they're notably not certifications but programs, but there's bit of crossover. These companies buy a lot of coffee, a substantial percentage of the world's coffee, and so it's helpful to understand what their programs are claiming to prioritize in their buying and sourcing. And the ones I chose are the Starbucks C.A.F.E. Practices, and that stands for Coffee And Farmer Equity, and then the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality Program. In researching this video I decided on a few kind of questions and key criteria to assess and compare these different standards. Not every certification, therefore, will have something to say for each of these sections. And also, it'll be hard to get into the real details on each one without this video being three hours long. But I've decided to keep those topics as the kind of structure of the video. And each one is of course timestamped down below if you want to skip to something in particular. Now, today is minimally my opinions. What I want to do is give you the bare bones, the layouts, the differences between the certifications, but I'm not gonna weigh in too heavily on my own personal opinions until maybe towards the end. The questions and the topics are as follows. Firstly, price for coffee. Is there a guaranteed premium or price? How much is it? Then labour practices. What do these certifications consider essential to prevent things like exploitation? And then farming practices. What is considered important in how plants are treated or soil is treated? Then eligibility, who actually can attain or get that certification? And then the cost. Who is on the hook for the cost of the certification? Who pays? And finally, we're gonna touch on how these certifications impact coffee quality. I'm not gonna lie. This video was tricky to make. The world of certifications is confusing, it's murky and frankly, often quite boring, but don't worry. We'll keep this entertaining and useful. I've worked in coffee for what, nearly 20 years, and I'd probably struggle to explain properly what each of those certifications really means. But that hasn't stopped me having opinions on them, many of which were challenged in researching this video. Now, as part of the research we contacted each of these organizations, and most were very gracious with their time and very helpful. All of the research for this was actually organized in some software called Notion. It's what we use for all videos on this channel, and I really enjoy using it. And in fact, if you want to know how I use it, well, I'll show you in a short ad for them now. Notion is incredibly flexible workspace software that you can use for almost anything, and I use it both professionally and personally. Now, I use it here to create videos for the channel, and there's a load of different uses. We would use it to collect initial ideas. We would use it to develop them, schedule them in, write out scripts if there's scripts, do a bunch of research, have it all in one place, and you can collaborate with a team in real time and it's wonderful. We also use it for collecting ideas for new products or just big overall planning, even note taking. Like I said, you can do a lot with it, and it's intuitive and it's easy. And if you think a certain way, it can look a certain way. But I also use it personally. You can use it for things like habit tracking, journaling, to-do lists, all of that kind of stuff is there built-in. And again, it's easy. You create a kind of template, fill it out, and it can think you think, work the way that you work. And that bit I think I like the most of all. If you want to check it out, you can sign up for free with the link down in the description below and start using Notion and start building something out. And I think you'll find that whatever your needs are, it can help you be more productive and make that work more enjoyable still. Thank you to Notion for sponsoring this video. Certifications are kind of a shortcut. They're there to try and help you make a better, easier purchasing decision. I use them sometimes if I'm in a supermarket. There's two bags of bananas and one of them has a certification and one doesn't, assuming that the certified one is more expensive, I would pick that one. But in order to define what is better, I would say that a helpful way to think about these certifications is to consider which set of values has the best kind of overlap with your own. And because of that, I can't really say that any one of these certifications is somehow better than the others, but there might be one that fits me personally better than the others. Also, it is common to see certifications overlap with one another rather than compete with one another. I think about the classic triple cert of Fairtrade, organic, Rainforest Alliance that I often see inside corporate offices where they're trying to buy coffee in a responsible way. Anyway, the last part of this video is also an important one. It's about specialty coffee because if you buy it, you'll have noticed a distinct lack of certifications on there, with the exception of organic, which you still see kind of occasionally. It's a kind of small part of the market. Specialty coffee seems to have rejected certifications and is often a little disparaging of them. This is a really important part of this whole discussion, and I've definitely had my mind shifted through researching this video. Okay, let's get into it. Let's start by talking about price. And for many people, this is the most important section. Coffee is too cheap, and I think people want some reassurance that the premium that they might pay when they buy that bag will make its way to the producers directly. This is, however, a tricky topic and we're gonna have to define a couple of jargony acronyms that you'll see used when people talk about coffee pricing. First up is FOB. Now that stands for freight on board. This is the price of the coffee once it has been fully processed and prepared for export. This price should cover all the various different actors in the supply chain from the producers through to, say, wet millers or dry millers, and it's the price at the point of export. So it is important to remember that the FOB price is not the price received by the producer. The producer will receive a percentage of that price, but that percentage will vary dramatically in different parts of the world. Then you have the term 'farm gate'. Now, this is the price received by the producer for their coffee. If a producer was able to, say, wet mill their own coffee, then their farm gate price would be closer to the FOB price, but do bear in mind many producers cannot do these additional steps. Now, I don't really see any data in certifications talking about Farm Gate price. Generally you'll see FOB price referenced. So let's start with Fairtrade International. Now, I should say that if you're not familiar with it, Fairtrade International actually creates the standards for that Fairtrade certification, but the actual certification processing is carried out by a slightly separate organization called FLOCERT. Now, they do the kind of compliance piece in the field. Fairtrade itself is a non-profit that sees itself as a people-led movement for change that works with farmers and workers to improve living standards, to do community welfare, and work on the shared environment. Now, Fairtrade International is the only certification I'm gonna talk about today that has a specific guaranteed minimum price mechanism. They will pay a minimum price of $1.40 per pound or they'll pay a 20 cent premium above the publicly traded price of coffee, which you'll see referenced as the C-market price. Basically, the New York Stock Exchange trades coffee commodities, and this is a kind of benchmark price used in most coffee transactions around the world. Even specialty coffee contracts might pay a price based on the C-market price, though the premium would be more than a couple of dollars per pound rather than, say, 20 cents though this varies a lot as well. There are also country-based differentials too. For example, coffees from Costa Rica will achieve a higher differential than coffees from Brazil just because of where they are grown, and this is for commodity grade as well as for specialty so there's a kind of market preference for certain coffees. Remember the term differential. I promise it'll be useful again in a minute. I think it's important to note that of the Fair Trade 20 cent premium that is guaranteed, five cents must be reinvested into improving production, and that can be training or into other systems to improve crop health and crop yield. Now, next up is the Rainforest Alliance, which if you don't know it, it is an NGO that aims, in their words, \"to create a more sustainable world by using social and market forces to protect nature and improve the lives of farmers and forest communities by making responsible businesses the new normal.\" Now, Rainforest Alliance doesn't current have any fixed or minimum pricing mechanisms. Essentially the free market decides the value to the producers of being certified. If buyers are willing to spend more on it, then the producer earns more for their certification. However, Rainforest Alliance are working to transition towards what they call a Sustainability Differential. The idea is that as part of the contract for the coffee there's an additional differential earmarked as a kind of bonus for the work being done on sustainability, and it's separate from any other premiums negotiated for, say, quality. However, there's not much guidance yet on what kind of differential that will be in terms of cold hard cash. Rainforest Alliance just say that this is down to the buyer-seller negotiations and quite explicitly that Rainforest Alliance will not intervene in these negotiations. Organic farming is a system of food production that excludes the use of synthetic agrochemicals and compounds and focuses on regenerative principles, essentially managing soil, water, and energy conservation for ecosystem health and for biodiversity. You're trying to build a more robust, resilient farm by farming in a kind of holistic way. Organic coffee has no fixed premium or differential, though there's enough data in the market that you can kind of work out what it will be with one exception. In the case of Fairtrade International, they do pay a 30 cent premium for certified organic coffees. And the average premium across all coffees is probably around this number, maybe a little bit lower. It's looking like around 27.5 cents. Two things to note though. This is highly variable because it's really hard to distinguish this certification from the rest of the coffee's value or quality. Secondly, that number I'm quoting you is a kind of premium on the FOB price. Historically, a good amount of this premium didn't actually make its way through to the Farm Gate pricing, though it is changing. Increasing transparency in the coffee trade is helping to undo that a little bit. Bird Friendly is next. Now, the Smithsonian scientists developed the Bird Friendly certification in the late 1990s for coffee specifically and it's there to conserve the habitat and protect migratory songbirds. Bird Friendly has no pricing mechanics as part of its certification, though it must be organic so there's maybe some premium kind of guaranteed there. Now, just to quickly touch on the two internal standards. Neither Starbucks nor Nespresso have any fixed minimums or premiums, though both talk about paying a premium for quality. Nespresso are clear that, while they audit the finances of the supply chain back to the farm, they pay exporters an FOB price rather than paying producers directly. And matching that, Starbucks also have an open book policy for the kind of financially auditing of their supply chain. But as I said, for either one, there's no real uniform or unified kind of price mechanism or transparency there. Now let's talk about farm practices, though with this section as well as the section on labor, the level of detail involved makes it really kind of difficult to compare. It kind of makes it binary unless you're an expert in the field. The standard includes something or it doesn't. You understand it or you don't. The nuance, the detail is really hard to pick apart. Where the standards are publicly available, we've linked to them down below if you want to deep dive and read deeper. To give you an example of how overwhelming these kind of standards are, well, Fairtrade, for example, covers key areas for environmental protection including things like energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction, soil and water quality, pest management, biodiversity protection, prohibition of genetically modified organisms and harmful chemicals and waste management. There are certain requirements that are pass-fail within the timeframe of converting to the certification, but it's just kind of a lot. Now, Rainforest Alliance has a similar list of topics, but they focus on a slightly different approach, and they seem to be more focused on a process of development and providing a framework for change and that development. Alongside mandatory requirements within certain timeframes, they encourage additional development of the farm's system of sustainable production. It seems more data-focused, and using that data as part of a feedback loop to drive continuous improvement. Organic farming obviously covers a lot of the same ground, built on those foundational ideas of no synthetic agrochemicals and regenerative farming aiming to improve soil health and resilience. There's some variation on organic standards, and there can be a bit of nuance there again. It's tricky to really turn into something simple and useful to you, but again, there'll be some more reading down below. Bird Friendly coffee has some more specificity, actually. It requires the following things. It requires at least ten tree species, three distinct layers of canopy, a minimum of 40% shade coverage, and tree height of 12 meters or more. In addition, all farms must be organic certified. I kind of like the simple specificity of that particular certification. Now, with Starbucks and Nespresso, because they aren't certifying compliance, they're just trying to verify and encourage best practices, you've got some different approaches. Starbucks run a point-based system, while Nespresso's program was developed in conjunction with the Rainforest Alliance and so has a similar feeling of a framework that aims to follow a pathway over time. Let's talk about labour practices. Now, like the farming practices section, this is again a tricky one to split out to compare. There's a lot of crossover between the certifications and programs here. The one outlier, I suppose, is organic certification. However, as that standard changes and evolves, more certifications are starting to aim to include the human aspect of farming more. Now, common topics in all the certifications are zero-tolerance policies for things like gender-based violence, child labor, violence, abuse, or harassment. Also, record keeping is expected for anyone who works on the farm, such as coffee pickers, and they must be paid what is described as fairly, transparently, and promptly. Though fair pay for these kind of workers is a bit of a controversial topic lacking in, I would say, meaningful standards. I wish I knew how to break these down more, but the detail is just overwhelming and it feels impossible to summarize in a way that feels useful to you when you're looking at a wall of coffee in a supermarket or a coffee shop and deciding which one to pick. You'll occasionally see some undercover journalistic work revealing breaches in human rights or working conditions on certified farms. Now, I think these pieces of journalism are useful and they're very necessary, but don't invalidate the certifications to me. Great journalism provides useful pressure on those certifying bodies to try and increase efforts to contain or remove bad actors, but these bad people are human, and they are kind of inevitable. Laws are not deemed useless because people break them, especially not because they break them and get away with it, and I kind of feel the same way about certifications. And in the past, if I'm honest, I've been dismissive of things like Fairtrade and used this as evidence, and I don't think that's actually a good argument or good thinking. Talk about eligibility. Now, this one's interesting to me and probably a surprise for many people. Fairtrade International only certifies producer groups, and these producer groups must be democratically-organized and must primarily consist, by that, that's above 66% of small-scale producers. Now, this is their term and they define it. A small scale producer, their farm must be managed by the member of the group and their family, and they cannot hire permanent labor. Larger producers with farms between say, five hectares and 30 hectares can join a producer group, but the majority, more than 50%, of the certified coffee that the group produces must come from these small-scale producers. This means if you owned a larger farm, you simply cannot attain a Fair Trade International certification. And this is one of the reasons that Fair Trade USA is a separate entity that aims to broaden the church of producers able to earn that certification. Now, Rainforest Alliance doesn't really have any eligibility requirements for producers. In fact, other members in the supply chain who process coffee can also be certified as well. Organic certifications are again open, and often several entities in the supply chain must be certified for the final product to be sold as certified organic. For example, a coffee roasting company must hold a certification to sell organic-labelled coffee. Bird Friendly certifications require an organic certification so you could argue that only organic farms are eligible to be Bird Friendly. Interestingly enough though, they'll often combine those certifications, that kind of visit audit part of the whole thing. Other than that, it's open to anyone. With Starbucks, anyone is eligible to be part of their program, but there's work to be done before you can start selling to them, such as opening up your price transparency so Starbucks can see where the FOB price historically has been going. And then you adopt their C.A.F.E. practices and a third party verifies them. The Nespresso approach is interesting. Anyone who is farming coffee in the regions that they're sourcing from can opt-in to the program and immediately receive free training and support. And so once they're adopting the principles, should they choose to, they can sell their coffee to Nespresso for the guaranteed AAA premium. The idea is that while the producer is free sell to someone else, because Nespresso know how the coffee was grown, they're willing to pay a premium for that because it's more valuable to them. Now let's talk about who pays for the certification. Now, Fairtrade certification costs do vary dramatically, but that cost is borne by the producer group as a whole. Those fees actually go to FLOCERT, which is the certification body that we mentioned earlier on, and it's separate from Fairtrade and so it's the one carrying out the auditing and certification. If you're curious, there are price calculators online if you want to go and look and experiment. Again, we'll leave a link down below. With Rainforest Alliance, the farmers pay for the certification audit, and Rainforest say they don't regulate those costs. The market regulates those costs. With the variance in farm size and location, there's obviously no single price for an audit. Additionally, any costs of meeting the demands of the standard are to be met by the farmer. And that might be the costs of changes to land use or for new infrastructure. This is, I presume, what the sustainability differential mentioned earlier on is aiming to cover or compensate for. With organic and Bird Friendly, as before, the certification costs are again borne by the producer. With Starbucks and Nespresso, these are both internal programs not certifications so there's no cost of certification here. And technically both are free to join, though Starbucks has a slightly different approach to Nespresso, as I mentioned above. If you want to sell to Starbucks, this is the way of proving that you're doing the right thing and to also then receive some support in improving. Nespresso just present it as free to join in exchange for free support. Starbucks and Nespresso both incur significant costs in these programs, and they finance them in slightly different ways. Starbucks issued, I think, Sustainability Bonds, the last one being a $1 billion bond and then you use the proceeds from that to fund this stuff. And Nespresso's Sustainability Fund is a vehicle for it to raise external funding, again, for this kind of work. Let's talk about cup quality. And now, I think this is an important aspect to discuss, quickly, especially for those of you who watch this channel and would care about the taste of the coffee that they drink. When it comes to Fairtrade, I think people presume that the coffees are all commodity grade. This isn't the case. There are wonderful and delicious coffees that are also Fairtrade certified. These will obviously receive a higher differential or premium compared to lower quality coffees. Fairtrade encourages producers to improve cup quality, but ultimately the certification alone does not guarantee quality one way or the other. Rainforest Alliance has no quality requirements, and that isn't part of the program. They consider the quality aspect a component of the negotiation between buyer and seller, and they don't really take any part in it. Now, when it comes to organics, the question of quality in all organic agriculture is somewhat controversial. It isn't a component of the certification, but it is worth addressing briefly. Now, some argue that, of course organic products taste better, that this kind of agriculture should produce more nutritious and delicious food. Other proponents of organics argue that organic does not taste any better, and to talk about that kind of misses the wider point of organics, the purpose being that we're trying to improve the way that we farm and interact with the land and soil that grows our food. In my experience, organic coffee can be just as delicious as conventionally-produced coffee, but again, it's not necessarily a guarantee of quality. Both Starbucks and Nespresso talk about paying a premium for quality. Their definitions of quality are perhaps wider than mine, but both of these are companies who aim to trade on the taste as a component of their brand experience. Both companies will buy a range of qualities, and Starbucks says they only really buy arabica while Nespresso does buy arabica and robusta. I think quality is a good opportunity to look at what drives Starbucks and Nespresso into having these kind of programs. Primarily it's about supply chain. It's about having a guaranteed supply of the qualities of coffees that they need and want for their businesses sourced in a way that marries up with the perceived ethics of their customer base and hopefully the ethics of the company itself. Other certifications start from an ideological place first and then are looking for ways to grow and self-perpetuate. And I think this is why Starbucks and Nespresso don't present these as certifications, but more as a framework or programs that have a verification component. And this brings me to the topic of specialty coffee and to the broad lack of certifications on those coffees. For the last 20 years now, you've probably heard specialty companies talk about paying premiums for quality far above those paid by Fairtrade. That's true, however, I think the idea that paying premiums for quality is a better approach for the farmer than those certifications is harder to justify. We haven't seen premiums for specialty coffee be particularly transformative. And in some cases the costs of production have just risen alongside the price paid, and in other cases we've seen those that are best able to achieve higher prices are often producers that start with more access to capital. This is not to damn specialty coffee and its mission, but to kind of temper some of the claims that it makes. Now, I should say that in some cases there just isn't much crossover. Many specialty coffees come from farms that may be too large to eligible for say, a Fairtrade certification. They're just too big or they employ too many people throughout the year. In some cases the farmers may actually have additional certification but the supply chain may not maintain that certification so you wouldn't know that it came from a certified farm. Organics is a good example here. In other cases, it's just the market responding. Customers who buy specialty coffee have learned that there's rarely very much crossover so they don't demand it of the coffees they buy and so there's no market pressure on roasters or importers or exporters or even producers to certify what they're doing. While some specialty companies do produce sustainability reports, I think a lot of the frameworks used by certifications have some untapped value to that sector of the industry. And I think it was, and I'm criticizing myself here as much as anyone else, perhaps shortsighted and arrogant to have been dismissive of certifications the way that we were. This whole video has been food for thought for me and I hope interesting for you. I think in certain cases I'm sort of annoyed that this just hasn't been a component of how we've thought about things or defined things in terms of what's important in how the coffee that we source is produced. It's been quality, quality, quality, quality and I think maybe at the expense of some other stuff.", "videoID": "PmwoSqg0dqI"}, {"title": "The Flair 58\uff1a Frustratingly Close To Outstanding", "text": "Today, we're gonna take a look at this. This is the Flair 58. Now, Flair have made money on espresso machines for a while. The 58 is their kind of top of the line unit. And there's three things about it that I wanna talk about that I think make it interesting and noteworthy, and are certainly worthy of discussion or thinking about if you're gonna buy a lever machine like this. This is the Flair Pro. It's a very useful travel espresso maker. If you ever need to sit in a park in London and drink espresso from the 1950s. That aside, I did like a lot about it. It's easy to put together. They had a kind of modular nature to it and it made nice espresso. There was a little bit of work to do with thermal management, but it made great espresso and it was fun to use. The 58 is the evolution from this. Primarily, that the name comes from the fact that it now uses a 58 millimeter portafilter. That is the common portafilter size in most commercial espresso machines. Not all, but it's probably the most common size of basket. That means that if you have something like a VST basket, you can use it in here, if you've got a tamper from another espresso machine, that'll work here. Now, when you're generating pressure with a manual lever machine, the size of the area that you're pressing onto does matter. If you go from a 45 mm basket to a 58 mm basket, well, then your lever size has to change too, because you've got a greater surface area in which you need to generate the same pressure across. So the unit gets quite a bit bigger going from the Pro to the 58, the lever gets longer, there's a big handle on the end here. You might feel like you're working a little harder, and you are, but the lever's doing a lot of that work for you. So it's not impossible to press with nine bars of force compared to this. It does just feel like a little bit more work to hit those pressures. Like this, it's got a little pressure gauge, so you can see your live pressure as you're brewing. Again, that's the pressure of what's happening kind of inside the brewing environment. So you may not want to hit nine necessarily because this gauge is showing you both pressure in as well as kind of what's leaking out of the bottom of the basket. So, what would be nine bars on a pump machine will look more like, usually about eight bars on the gauge like this. But you can experiment, you can play. You've got the information that you need. This whole thing feels pleasantly sort of sized and weighty. The build quality for Flair stuff has always felt good in terms of the componentry and the metals and those kinds of things. So I like the fact that they've gone to 58. It makes it a more convenient size for the collector. If this is one of many machines for you, I know that's not normal, but it's also not uncommon. Then this kind of fits in kind of nicely. If you've already got a machine that, you know, makes espresso and steams milk, but you wanna play around with levers, this may be tempting because everything you have in terms of tampers, all that stuff already works, already fits. Life is kind of easy. Now, this has been around for a few months. In fact, it's been around for so long that Flair are already starting to ship an updated version. I'll touch on that briefly, but this is the original model, I guess, of the 58. The new one has a few workflow improvements. It doesn't, I think make better espresso from what I'm seeing. It's just a little easier to work with. No bad thing as far as I'm concerned. The primary change is at the base of this unit here of the preheat unit here. This one has a fixed screen at the bottom of it. The new ones do not, and they are reliant on this. Now this is the second thing that I think is interesting about the Flair 58. This is a puck screen. And I think we're gonna see more and more of these outside of the Flair being used in espresso making at home. I don't think that they'll end up in cafes, but I think at home, you'll start to see these more and more. This is a little disc that sits on top of your tamped, sort of prepped coffee inside the basket. And it sits in theory between, on this machine, the shower screen and the coffee itself. Why would you want something like this? Well, firstly, it will help distribute water more evenly across the puck. And evenness is always the name of the game in better espresso brewing. Secondly, and this is where it gets kind of interesting. It creates a space above the puck for water to fill in and sort of do that pre-infusion moment where water fills above the puck, but it will prevent the puck expanding all that much during that phase. That seems to help with evenness kind of keeping the puck contained, but allowing a space for pre-infusion water to build seems like a good thing. Just about any machine out there may well see a benefit from using something like this. Now, when we come to pull a shot, I'll talk about the pros and cons of using this in a sort of practical sense, but this ships as standard that this is now the replacement for a fixed dispersion screen on the newer units, I think is really interesting. And the third thing that's interesting about the Flair 58 is kind of this thing here. Now, this is the control box for the heating element around this part of the brew chamber here. Now I plugged this into a little volt meter, had a look at it. It draws about 85 Watts. So it's not a particularly powerful element inside this thing. And the thermostat attached to it has kind of three heat settings, low, medium, and high. This means this unit is designed to be plugged into main power supply while you are using it. You could in theory, disconnect it and use it without this preheating element attached to it. But, if you're buying this, you would buy it so it does the preheating piece. Now, the reason you would do this is because if you've used a Flair or really any manual espresso machine, that would be something like The Rock or The Robot, thermal management is a bit of an issue. If you wanna hit those higher brewing temperatures for espresso, then you've gotta work really quickly, and that can just be a little bit difficult to do. The idea with this is that this will preheat actively the unit here, the brew chamber here, so that your water is going into an already hot environment. Now they give you some temperature guidance. They say low is about 85, medium is about 90, and the upper temperature high is about 95 degrees Celsius. That should not be confused for the brew temperature that you will get from those settings. Touch more on that in a second. The implementation of this is kind of weird and awkward. So you've got the part here. This connects to this control box here, and this control box connects to a power supply that then plugs into the wall. So there's a bit of cabling to deal with that I don't particularly love. And the fact that it's three pieces. I also don't particularly love. It's a little ugly. This box feels a little cheap, if I'm honest. Now Flair do ship the 58X and that is without this active heating thing here. And the difference in price is about $90. This one with the preheating is $575. The X that does not have the preheat is $485. So $90 worth of element control and power supply. This preheating stuff is both the biggest advantage, the biggest strength of this unit, and to me, the biggest weakness. The biggest point of frustration. But let's get into pulling some shots. Now I have this set at high because I want maximum temperature here. And so this brew chamber is pretty hot and you'll feel it's hot to the touch. And generally in usage, you wouldn't really wanna touch this anyway. But let me clear some space, let me move this back out of the way. There's a little bit more to you, so you can see what's going on. Now, I'm still chasing the upper end of brew temperature. So my workflow is kind of around that. I'm gonna do all of the puck work first, get this thing locked in, loaded, happy, ready to go and kettle boiling. And then as soon as I put my boiling water in the top, I'm gonna try and move on and pull a shot pretty much straight away. Now I did a bunch of temperature testing on this with a Scace device, which was a little bit difficult and hacky to kind of get into the unit, but I manged to get it done. And that gives me a pretty good indication of what brew temperatures are during a typical kind of pull. And yes, the different temperatures of the preheat unit do impact brew temperatures in a way that is kind of unsurprising. My lower temperature shots were in the mid eighties. My medium temperature was around 90, but the hottest I ever got was just above 93 degrees Celsius. And that was having pulled a bunch of shots back to back, where this was very much preheated. Using water, literally straight off the boil, at boiling point in and straight to brewing. And I still really peaked at 93. So while the chamber may get to 95, it's not accurate to say that that's going to be your brew temperature or certainly hasn't been the case in my testing. Anyway, there's a few more details, but it'll help from pulling a shot to talk you through those. So I've prepped, dosed, tamped, my basket of coffee. I didn't use the included tamper. This is what comes with it. I don't love this, ergonomically. I've got very large hands, which probably is a bit of a problem, but I've got nice 58 mm tamper. So that was easy enough to deal with. And then on top of this goes our little puck screen. And this we're then gonna load in, slightly awkward this way around, and then get that boiling water in straight away. To put water in the brew chamber, just lift the little arm up, this unlocks. And that's straight off the boil, in we go. Now you might hear towards the end, a little bit of sort of hissing, which is interesting to me. That indicates that the hottest part is right at the top of the unit. Now I'm gonna lock this in. Put my little arm in place, and I'm going to begin a little pre-infusion. Put a little pressure up, first few drops, raise the pressure up. It's pretty hard to do this way around. I'm not gonna lie to you. I made me for about 36 out. When I get there and lift the lever all the way to the top, take my coffee out, enjoy that in a second. And then they recommend pressing through the rest of the liquid. Leave you back at the top. Does this produce good espresso? 'Cause it does. All the principles of good espresso making are there. And you know, it's ultimately about good grind, good water, and getting the grind right and pressing the water through appropriately. What appropriate is, varies. It can be a flat profile. It can be a declining profile. There's no one answer to that, but it's a very capable espresso machine. Is that the best advice I've ever made? No, I would recommend having it the right way around so you can actually see the gauge as you make espresso. I think it's a very capable machine. I think the Flair Pro was capable and this I think is leveling up. It's a good jump in price, but I think there is an increase in quality, in versatility. I think it makes nice espresso. I think it is mostly very nice to use. Now, you'll see here in the base, I have an Acaia Lunar and it feels as if the base of this thing, the drip tray for this was built specifically for the Acaia Lunar, which feels kind of wild because that is a very, very expensive set of weighing scales. The drippy bits here, not the end of the world. If you go through their kind of purge process afterwards, it's pretty easy to deal with. And then when you're dealing with your sort of basket afterwards, it's pretty dry. Getting this out, I don't know if there's a perfect way of doing it yet. I've often just put my sort of cleaning towel down, gently tapped it. Oh, that mostly works, sometimes it does not. Sometimes I lose the puck too. This is definitely useful and interesting. And probably, you know, you'll start to see more and more videos about this on YouTube from various other coffee creators too. One thing I will say is that visually clean on these things is not truly clean. You wanna give this a little soak in maybe some espresso machine cleaner and hot water at the end of the day it's usage, especially, if you've pulled multiple shots, because there is sort of hard access dirt in these, and you wanna get rid of that or it will begin to make your espresso taste bad. So that's the Flair 58. And if you have one or you're thinking about getting one that I would recommend checking out Lance Hedrix's video on it, he has some good workflow tips. Stuff like using the Smart espresso profile or app as part of using this thing day to day, especially with the smart scale, to understand flow a little bit more and know what to do in terms of chasing pressures as you're pulling a shot. I'll leave that link down below. The question ultimately, is, is it good value for money and would I recommend you buy it? What was the most important questions? At $575, I think it is well built. It's well made. It produces very good espresso. Can I think of an espresso machine that is as flexible as good looking that makes espresso of this quality that is at the same price point, not easily actually. So it is worth considering if you're never gonna steam milk, if you just wanna pull espresso, if you are interested in a pure manual lever experience, it's definitely worth considering it. I think if you compare it to its upper tier manual competitors, things like The Robot, then I think it is strongly competitive. And I think having to do less thermal management is definitely a good thing and a nice part of the process. But really I think my frustrations are around the execution of what I think is ultimately, a very good idea. I think adding power supplies to these, I think adding some thermal support to these is a good thing. I don't really like the way that it's done on the 58. The point at which Flair kind of lost me with their system is when they sent me an email regarding the disconnection sequence for this thing. There is a specific order in which you must disconnect the cables behind this thing. So you have to disconnect, first, the one closest to the mains and then this one closer to the brew head here. I presume there's some sort of capacity issue or something else going on inside this box that I don't understand it's beyond my pay grade, but that as a user experience is not good that I have to remember an unplugging sequence is not a good experience. The fact that the diagram that they sent me to do it labeled the first thing that they wanted me to disconnect as the number two. And the second thing is number one blew my mind. That's just really unhelpful for your user base. I think, you know, I don't quite understand what you were doing there. But that to me is a problem. I don't wanna have to think about that when I'm taking this thing to pieces. It's not a fun part of this process. And honestly, if I'm to be harsh, this feels like a good idea executed in the easiest way possible for Flair, not necessarily the best way possible for you, the user. I don't think this box is a great control box. I don't think low, medium and high is that indicative though, I get the idea that they're not trying to give you a single number because it doesn't produce a single number. This bulky control here, the fact that there's two breaks in the cable, I just don't like it. My ideal implementation would be a cable that plugs just once into the back of the unit here. I have some controls on this unit here somewhere and I go low, medium high. And it's just all in one. I plug one thing in, I've got one thing to mess around with and it's done. I don't need this to be, you know, a PID style to the degree Celsius. I get what they're going for. And I'm okay with what they're going for in terms of accuracy and repeatability. But I just don't like the execution. And I would hope in the future, they find ways to improve the execution of this. Now this may not bother you, right? This may not bother you at all. This might be me having reviewers syndrome where you think about things a lot and you get more upset than perhaps most people would do, because you're thinking about things in a very analytical way. I get that. And I would love to hear from those of you who own this down in the comments below, whether you have found this good or bad, frustrating, or really not a problem at all. But for me, I like what it does to brew temperature. I like the assistance here. I just don't like the execution. And to make that point more time, this is not setting a brew temperature. The temperature of the water that you put in from your kettle to the unit really dictates your brew temperature. If this is as hot as possible, then you will get close to that 93, 94 degrees Celsius thing. If it's two or three degrees cooler, you'll be brewing 90 degrees Celsius quite easily. If that's cooler still, you'll be brewing in the eighties. So it's really about you still doing some temperature management work, you building a good workflow around this, if you're chasing those upper temperatures. If you're chasing 90 or even sort of the mid to high eighties. Yeah, it's a little easier. It really is. You know, you can put in hot water and it cools down. One final note actually, and this is being perhaps a little too fussy, but when I filled that chamber, right at the end is when you it hiss. As if it was hitting very hot metal at that point, as if the top of the chamber was hotter than the bottom of the chamber. If you look closely at the temperature data from all the captures that I have, you'll see that there is a very slight upwards temperature profile during those shots. The very last bit of the shot. It seems to be a little bit hotter than the very start of the shot. Not a lot, but it's definitely there, and it happened across multiple pulls. And it could be that the heating is primarily, done at the top. Hot water rises, and so there is literally cooler water at the bottom of that brew chamber than there is at the top. And as you press, the cooler water hits the coffee first, and the hottest water hits the coffee last, most people would say that isn't gonna make a massive difference. It's a small increase. Some would say that they like a decline in brew temperature. That's common with a number of different machines, particularly lever machines. So it's interesting to me that this bucks that trend, and I think it's something that you should know about if you're considering buying one and are a little bit obsessive about brew temperature. Now I don't get to keep this unit. This goes to one of my Patreon supporters who give me a budget every month to go and buy equipment, review it, use it and tell you my honest opinion. And at the end it makes me very happy to give it away to one of them. Now, I wanna hear from you down in the comments below, do you have one of these? Have you enjoyed using it? Are you like me, nearly completely charmed, but somehow not quite. I really like the espresso from this. I really like most of the user experience, but it's so frustratingly nearly there that I just can't get past the little things that annoy me about this unit. So that's it.", "videoID": "3X84AYoNEQw"}, {"title": "The Ultimate Clever Dripper Technique", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about brewing coffee with the Clever Coffee Dripper. This is a fantastic way to make coffee. I've been a fan of this for a long time and I sometimes feel it doesn't get the recognition that it deserves. Now, it's a steep and release brewer. This was pioneering in the steep and release brewer space in coffee. The way that that works is you put a filter paper inside this, you put your coffee and water in and you let them steep. And when you're ready to drink the coffee, you put the brewer on top of something. It could be a mug, it could be a carafe. That causes a stopper to lift and the liquid drains out of the bottom. It's maybe 20 pounds or $30. It's very easy to use, it's robust, it's BPA-free of plastic and making coffee with it is pretty easy and the results are pretty great. Now, the technique I'm gonna talk you through is pretty focused on getting a good, even extraction but also getting a pretty quick draw down. That's the phrase that we use to describe the liquid filtering through the coffee into the cup below. For many people, it often seems to just stall and stop and stop filtering and that's very, very frustrating. So we're gonna try and fix that problem. Now, it's an immersion brew method and typically, I would recommend 75 grams a liter but more and more, I've been enjoying closer to 60 to 65 grams a liter. Even at that sort of lower ratio, you still get tons of texture, tons of mouth feel. Now, this is designed to use paper filters. These are the Melitta style paper filters in this shape. I quite like the Filtropa brand. A lot of people like the Melitta one. Size number four is what you need for this larger size here. You can brew, at an absolute push, 500 mills of liquid, though I would not recommend it. Practically, I would say up to 400 mills and today I'm gonna be brewing 15 grams to 250 grams of water just for the purpose of demonstration. Most of the time, I'll just use that one grain size for the same coffee and the same ratio, even if I'm changing the recipe slightly. Different coffees may need different grain sizes but broadly speaking, once you've got a coffee dialed in, I tend to stick to that grain size, regardless of the recipe, as long as that ratio is fixed. To start with, just give the paper a little fold. It's not essential but it will help have the paper sit a little bit neater inside the brewer. Open it up, pop it in the brewer and give it a rise with some hot water. You don't have to use a freshly boiled kettle. You can use hot water from a good hot tap in your sink. It's probably not worth boiling a kettle, refilling it and boiling it again to do it this way. So hot enough is fine. We're just trying to rinse some paper taste out and pre-heat the brewer a little bit. But it's plastic, so it's not gonna absorb that much temperature anyway. As for the grain size, for me, I could best describe it as medium, fine. It is probably finer than most people would expect for a steep style brewer. Certainly finder than most people brew French presses. Pretty close really to the grain size I would use for a two-cup V60. I'll show you some grains on screen from this particular brew next to the KRUVE BREWLER to give you an idea of how large these pieces are. Now, once you've ground your coffee, this is the key to this particular technique. Do not put the coffee in the Clever yet. Wait. Now, as I understand it, this particular part of the technique came from a company called Workshop Coffee in London. They have a little YouTube channel. I'll link to that down below. They discovered that if you put the water in first and then the coffee, your draw-down time is quicker. And that's what we're gonna do today. We're gonna boil our water, fill our Clever and then add our coffee afterwards. This way, when you come to drain the coffee out, it happens much, much, much, much, much quicker. It can be anywhere from twice as fast as going coffee first and then water second. For some reason, going coffee first and then water causes this sort of clogging effect on the paper filter that going water first, then coffee doesn't. It's really interesting and great little technique and shout out to them for coming up with this. I did test doing half of the water, then the coffee, then the other half of the water. It was quicker than doing coffee first, then water but it still wasn't as quick as doing water first, then coffee and there was no real appreciable benefit or improvement in taste that way. So this way, it tastes amazing and is quicker. Straightaway off the boil, pour your water into the dripper. We're gonna pour 250 mills in this case. Again, as quickly as possible, we're gonna add our coffee and give it a little stir to make sure it's all mixed. You don't wanna go overboard with the stirring. Just make sure that there's no pockets of dry coffee there and then we're gonna let it steep for two minutes. Now, the Clever now come with a lid and that is designed to be used on top of the brewer while it's brewing. However, in testing, I found no appreciable benefit to the lid and it's just a piece that I don't wanna faff around with, I don't wanna complicate this anymore than I need to. So I never use the lid. Now, as we get to two minutes, we wanna break that crust that's formed on top to have as much coffee fall to the bottom as possible and sit as a nice bed to evenly have the water pass through for a nice extraction. You've got two choices. You can stir if you want to. If it's a smaller brew like this. I tend to just give it a little shake, just so I'm mixing it all kind of evenly and then after 30 seconds of letting it fall down, then I'll start it brewing. It's perfectly okay just to give this a little gently stir just to break the crust instead. It's really up to you. Now, when I put this on here, the first liquid out will look suspiciously weak and that's because a little bit of liquid sits just outside the paper from when you first filled that Clever. So it doesn't really take part in the brewing process, which is perhaps a flaw of the brewer but it hasn't stopped me getting great results. You should end up with a nice flat bed at the bottom of that brew and your draw-down time should take probably in the region of a minute. Now, this is gonna change depending on the coffee you're brewing and the grinder that you're using. With something like a Wilfa Uniform, my brews take about a minute to a minute and 15 to draw down. Here with a high-end grinder, it might be like 45 seconds but if I was doing coffee first, then water, you could probably double those times for the draw down. It's a fascinating impact from such a simple switch technique. Let's have a taste. Great Clever brews have wonderful texture, lovely clarity from a paper filter and really good sweetness. This is exactly that. If it was still a little bit hollow, I would definitely grind it finer and you might surprise yourself at how fine you're going but if you hit that wall of bitterness and harshness, then do just back it off a little bit coarser and see if that sweetens things up a little bit. One other note, I would say if you're trying to avoid that liquid that sits outside of the paper right at the bottom of the brewer, don't give in to the temptation to push the paper down as far as it can go. I wouldn't recommend that. That tends to mess with the draw down a little bit. So just leave it sat neatly inside the brewer if you can and accept that some of that water is gonna act to dilute the brew and not be too involved in the brew process. I really like this brew method because it's very easy, it's very simple. It doesn't need a lot of tending over or standing around and doing stuff. It's kinda do a couple things, go away, do something else, come back, do a couple things and also if you are a little bit out on your timings, if you leave it steeping for 30 seconds, a minute, even two minutes longer, you'll still have a really great result. I don't think there's any real benefit to stepping beyond the two minutes but there's certainly nothing detrimental to a longer brew time like that. You still get a really great cup at the end of it. As long as your water is good, your grinder's right and the coffee that you start with is delicious. The Clever is a simple and relatively affordable way to make great paper filtered coffee.", "videoID": "RpOdennxP24"}, {"title": "The Best Electric Temperature Controlled Gooseneck Kettles", "text": "It's, it's so expensive. I don't want to stroke my kettle. If I have to break out a manual to use a kettle, have you made it too complicated?  Today, we're gonna look at temperature-controlled electric gooseneck kettles, which is an easy, flows-off-the-tongue sentence. And I thought it would be quite a simple video. I thought, you know, I should do more comparisons and maybe that's not gonna be too much work and I was wrong. How do you compare these things? Well how do you not turn it into some sort of weird subjective thing, you need objective testing. And that took us to some interesting places. But first, before we get into how we tested them, let's look at what's on the bench, their price and their kind of milliliter capacity. It's just gonna be in metric today. No surprises to anyone. So starting over here with the cheapest of the kettles, this is the Diguo, it's not a brand I'm familiar with. It was on Amazon. It was \u00a353 and it has a 700 milliliter capacity. Next up is a little bit more expensive, it's the Dualit. Now this is \u00a385 with an 800 milliliter capacity. Here, we've got the Timemore. This is more expensive again at \u00a395 with only a 600 milliliter capacity. Here, we have the Felicita Square. Big jump in the price up to \u00a3125. And again, just the 700 milliliter capacity. Here we have the Bonavita. This is \u00a390 pounds and has a one liter capacity. Next to it is the Brewista and this is their latest kettle. This has a 1.2 liter capacity and is \u00a3100. Now, this feels a little unfair. I paid \u00a3195 for the Hario electric Buono kettle. I have seen it cheaper in Europe, but in the UK it's quite expensive and it has an 800 milliliter capacity. And last up is the Fellow Stagg EKG coming in at \u00a3150 in the UK and 900 milliliters in capacity. So a range of sizes and prices, and I had to work out how do you test these in an objective manner? And the first thing I wanted to do was do a kind of heating efficiency speed test. And actually we did it twice. So for the first test, we put 500 grams of room temperature water, which was at 22 degrees Celsius. And we set the kettles to 95 degrees Celsius 'cause they're all temp controlled and we checked how long it would take them to get up to temperature. Now, they all have different wattages and that's kind of important here, right? A kettle that has a higher wattage will work quicker. So we had to kind of factor that in. So I made a graph. It's a pretty simple graph and it shows you along the bottom is the wattage, how powerful a kettle might be, and up the side, how long it took to reach its target temperature. And the line here on the chart is the kind of theoretical maximum speed for that wattage, right? You can do the maths. It's relatively easy to calculate how long it should take with a fixed wattage to heat, a fixed amount of water from a fixed temperature to a desired end temperature. It's not, it's not too complicated. I can do it. And then we can see how the various kettles did. Now, the question for me was, would the kettle be very careful and quite slow in kind of pushing the temperature up as it got close to its target temperature, would it go really quickly and just do a little bit at the end? What was the timing like? So as you look at the chart, you'll see the kettles, the further they are directly above that line, then the slower they were for the power that they had. And there were a couple of standouts that were a bit slower than I expected and one that sort of cheated. Now, during all of this, they were plugged into one of these. It's a really cheap sort of socket meter. They let me see what their actual wattage draw was. Now, the voltage in the studio is higher than is typically rated. We're at about 245 volts, which is why, you know, there was a kind of big bump in wattage from the kettles versus what they sort of listed as pulling. So, in most cases they were pulling more than sort of 10%, you know, which is kind of crazy, than the listed wattage. So that's just important to note. What you could also then see was how the kettles were using power. Now, the Dualit was interesting because it sort of ran on full power and then it seemed to drop to exactly half power, like there's two separate elements here that it runs one or both, depending on how much heat it needs, but it turned out to be pretty slow. So it sort of disengaged one of the two elements as it got close and then sort of paused its way there. But it was actually quite a slow kettle. And this one here, the Timemore was also quite slow, which was interesting. Just really gentle, just really took it's time to sort of push its way very slowly to the required temperature. The Felicita however, just kind of cheated. Like it just overshot quite a lot. It peaked at sort of 97, 98 when I set it to 95. It was very quick, but it just ran the power until 95 and then switched off and, you know, the additional residual energy inside the element continue to heat the water and there was a decent amount of overshoot. So a disappointing result for the Felicita. Aside from that, they were kind of much of a muchness, right? Like they were pretty similar in their kind of timings, given their respective wattages. Then I wanted to do a different heating test, hopefully a simpler one. I just wanted them to boil. And if they're smart, right, if they're supposed to be smart kettles, they should know that if I just want boiling they can just put the element into go until it hits boiling point, like a regular normal kind of cheap kettle does. And some of them worked that out and some of them didn't. The Dualit again, was pretty slow. It clicked into that half element power or that sort of 600 watt power supply kind of range as it got close in there for quite a long time to boil. The Timemore was extremely nervous to get close to boiling point and really, really, really took its time. This was really quite slow to get where I needed to go, which was interesting and kind of a surprise. Now in some cases, and we can take this kettle here, the Brewista, this just has a button that is boil, just go. And that's exactly what it does. So this performed really well. It was very quick and surprisingly because it just did what it was supposed to do. The Hario Buono just seems to be very quick to boil. There was no messing around. It just went straight to a hundred and clicked off. And then yes, also the Fellow Stagg. Again, it tries to be a little clever and just take you very slowly, very accurately to 100. So this was also a pretty slow kettle in that regard. And this was a bit nerdy, but if you think about the time it takes to get where you need to go every single morning, assuming you brewed just once a day, then time adds up. It's kind of important. But again, how a kettle gets to boiling point is important to me because kettle have other uses. You're not just gonna do a pour over if you've bought an electric kettle. You might have other applications. You might wanna make tea. You might wanna make a French press or another kind of emulsion brew that doesn't need a slow pour of water, and you might wanna go straight to boiling and then be able to pour quite quickly. Now how these pour, we'll get to in a minute, and it is really genuinely very interesting. But what I also wanted to check first was the kind of maximum flow rate that these spouts let you produce. If you wanna make tea, if you wanna make a French press, then you would want the water to come out actually pretty quickly. And there's really kind of two groupings here of the kettles. Five of them produced quite a high flow rate right, in the 40 plus ml per second. That would let you do a sort of 10, 12, second pour for half a liter. Fine, totally fine. However, three of the kettles just poured too slowly for me to recommend them for uses outside of pour over brewing. And so the three slow kettles are the Diguo, this maxed out at 24 milliliters per second, which is pretty slow. If we think about that half liter fill, that is a 20 second pour, not hugely convenient. A little bit quicker but still too slow was the Timemore, which was 27 ml per second. Just a bit too slow for me for multiple applications. And by far, the slowest was the Fellow. That maxed out at 17 grams per second, which is just too slow. If you think about how long that takes to fill a half-liter French press, that's just awkwardly long time. It's just an irritatingly long time to just, you just want the water out. I don't want to own two kettles. I don't wanna have two kettles in my kitchen. It doesn't make sense. If you wanna make tea, if you wanna make, I don't know, like instant ramen or something, something quick, having a separate kettle for that, no. You just really would need a kettle like this. If you're only gonna be brewing pour over coffee and really nothing else that requires a kettle and I think that's worth talking about. But, I did say we talk about pouring and then this is where things get really interesting. The challenge for me was how do you find a way of objectively measuring the quality of the pour? How does the water fall from the sort of spout of that gooseneck? Now thankfully, Jonathan Gagn\u00e9 recently published a very interesting little book. It's called \"The Physics of Filter Coffee.\" This isn't a paid promotion and there's no affiliate link down below, but if you're interested in this kind of stuff, I would strongly recommend checking it out. And he has an entire chapter on the sort of flow from a pouring kettle. And this was most definitely the inspiration for this section of the video. In the book Jonathan talks about what's called breakup length. I'm gonna really simplify here. There's a lot more detail if you're interested in it, but essentially at what point in the stream, does it go from a sort of steady, complete stream and then begin to kind of bead into droplets. Now you might've seen things like that kind of viral video that went down of like how well-made some Chinese teapots were in the way that they pour. I'll show you that just here, it's kind of interesting to see like a very bad kettle. You see that beading happened quite early. With an exceptionally good kettle, it just almost never happens. But what we decided to do was pour all of these kettles at a fixed flow rate, at a fixed height and measure using slow motion at what point those streams began to bead. And first we did that at 10 ml per second, and I'll show you that right now. And as you look at it, you can see there's some interesting variation in sort of the way that the streams are breaking up. For example, the Diguo isn't doing very well. The stream is breaking up actually relatively early on in terms of height. Whereas something like the Hario Buono, it's doing pretty well. You can see that stream remains intact a lot longer in the pour. And I kind of put the breakup lengths on screen so you can sort of see the variation here. You could argue exactly how long that breakup length is, but roughly speaking, these are the kind of differences between them. But during the testing, we thought 10 ml per second, maybe it wasn't entirely fair. You know, you don't often use that rapid of a flow rate when you're pouring a pour over. So we tested again at five milliliters per second or five grams per second. Again, the results are super, super interesting, and you can see at some of the slower pour rates kettles again, like the Hario Buono does really well. That stream remains extremely complete for quite a long time. You know, it's a long length of unbroken water, which is, you know, I think the solid endorsement of the quality of its spout. Again, you know, the lengths of, approximate length of breakups are here on the screen if you wanna have a kind of rough comparison for each of the kettles that are labeled at the bottom. Now in reading the chapter in Jonathan's book, you can understand why this is important. The quality or the nature of the stream of water when it hits the bed, the brewing bed, really impacts the nature of agitation and extraction. And to better illustrate this, we brewed some coffee until I had nothing left to give. and then we put it in a transparent V60, and you can see when a slow but steady stream of water hits the bed, that column of water penetrates right to the bottom of the bed and agitates the coffee underneath it extremely effectively. However, once that water starts to bead and turn to droplets, it's much less effective at agitating the coffee in the bed. This is not the point at which we say, this is the right way to agitate coffee and this is the wrong way. It's really about control and optionality and understanding these things, understanding pour heights, understanding how you wanna agitate your coffee consistently, but it seemed to be a kind of beautiful, interesting, fun way to compare the qualities of each of the spouts. Now we're gonna get into some more subjective territory. I'm gonna use each one. I'm gonna heat up the water, pour a little bit, just talk through the experience of using it, the UX UI, the features, the functions on the kettles, one by one and let you know what I think. So the Diguo, some pretty simple features, but what you'd expect from a temp control kettle. An on off button, a temperature set button, and that will cycle through various temperatures, but you can get close to where you wanna go and use the plus and minus. And once you've let it set for a little bit it'll click on the little light that says work comes on which I quite like that. There is of course a hold button that will keep it holding at your desired temperature for awhile, but let's just heat it up and pour some water. A little beep to let me know it's done and let's make coffee. Now the pouring experience with this thing, I'm not a huge fan. We already know that the spout isn't superb, the handle actually, I really dislike it. It's at a weird angle. The balance of the whole thing feels off and it just is quite uncomfortable to hold, actually in comparison to a bunch of the other kettles. So if I own this, I probably wanna bend the shape of this to bring it a little bit more sort of down in line. So the next step is the Dualit. I quite like the fit, the finish of this. It feels well-made and it's a big company. It's a well-known company. The matte finish on this looks really nice. I like the shape. The spout is pretty good. To control it you've got a dial that will set your temperature. We're gonna set ours again to 95. And in the middle of this there's a little button that will set things going. There is as usual a hold button, as well as a Celsius Fahrenheit setting as well. Let's go. Nice little beep at the end. I like a beep. You can push a button and turn the beep off. That's an option too, but I like a beep. As long as it's a good beep. Now the buttons on here feel good. The dial feels nice to adjust it. It is made with, you know a good quality build, but to pour with it feels like it wants to pour fast. Actually, it's quite difficult to kind of have a slower controlled pour. It doesn't feel quite as easy. The angle of the spout sort of projects the water quite a long way forwards. It's not my favorite to pour with. So the Timemore Smart kettle is a frustrating thing. As you look at this, you'll see it's a nice little base. It looks very clean. It looks extremely minimal. And you can see this sort of a couple of things here. Here's a hold button. You know, it's sort of a light LED underneath and here's the start stop button. You can see on here. there's the temperature of the water, it's quite warm in the studio today. and our target temperature is 95. But how do we change our target temperature?  Well like this. You have to sort of run your finger up and down this little board that is not particularly responsive. This is for me quite an unpleasant experience. I don't want to stroke my kettle. I don't. I don't wanna, you know, it's a really odd interaction decision to do. Like, I don't know why, why. Why? I don't know why. Occasionally it's accurate. Occasionally it seems to register nothing at all. I got to just stroke it just right. Interestingly, you could start it by pushing hold or start and stop, which is sort of interesting. It'll put it into heating mode. A little light comes on. That's nice as it beeps, I'm okay with the beep. And just while it's heating I'll mention the lid. There's a rubber gasket with a little sort of knobbly bits on it too. It's quite hard to seat properly. You know, it just doesn't feel quite right often and I often found myself having not put it on properly. It just doesn't feel quite right to me. Now interestingly once it finishes heating, it just shows you your target temperature. And it doesn't seem to read the live temperature anymore. This says it's holding it there, but, but it's just not fluctuating. You're really quite nice to pour with, not bad. Pretty easy to work with. Yeah, okay. I wish the capacity was a little bit bigger, but the handle is good, the spout is pretty good. I have no real complaints about the experience of pouring. All of my complaints really are to do with the base of the unit. So next up is the Felicita Square. Square. Here is the first of the problems. They've chosen to sort of tweak the design a little bit by making the lid on top kind of square shape with kind of rounded corners here. I think there's quite a lot of, you know, say imitation of Fellow's design, the handle feels very Fellow Stagg, but the lid is different. The problem with the square lid and fans of Pythagoras may already be ahead of the curve on this one, is that when you have a square in an opening like this, it means that there is a gap longer than the sides of the lid, which means it's relatively easy to accidentally drop the lid into the kettle, right?  Like it, it goes in, just really easily. It just fits. A square is a bad lid design. It's that simple. Do not make your lid square. Circles work really well. Right, you can't get the lid into the kettle no matter how hard you try. Here with very little work just in and that's bad. So let's look at the rest of the build. The design is relatively simple. Everything is really conducted through two buttons on a dial. There's just a large sort of shelf space here with the brand name on. I feel like that's a weird use of real estate. The dial itself, isn't great. It works fine. It just doesn't feel particularly well-made. There's quite a lot of play in it. It doesn't feel beautifully machined. It feels cheap and this is \u00a3125. And so it just doesn't feel to me quite like it achieves that premium price. To use, turn it on, set your temperature. And it's easy to do, you know. A little gear icon flushes while it's setting. And once you've left it alone for a couple of seconds, it kicks on and begins to heat. It beeps when it ends and I'm a fan of that. I like to be reminded when my kettle is done especially if there isn't gonna be an obvious kind of boiling moment if I'm aiming for that lower temperature. To pour with, nice. Plenty of control, it feels pretty easy to use. No real complaints about the balance or the weighting of this thing. It's not a bad kettle to pour with. It deems to do a pretty good job heating water though, not always very accurately. I don't really have any issues with this. I just wish again, the base was a little bit better built and a little bit more intuitive, and I wish they'd changed the lid design and then I think you'd have a good little kettle at that point. So next up is the Bonavita. It's a bit further away this way because the cable is quite short, which is actually a bit of a negative for me. I want a slightly longer cable on my stuff for flexibility, but that's a small nit-pick. Features wise, pretty simple. It's got the kind of classic set up that you've seen onto another Diguo though I think the Diguo is most definitely inspired by this one here. So on off button, your temperature flashes. You can cycle through with your sort of temp set button. Leave it be for a second, it'll flash, and then when you've done nothing, it'll click on. You've got you're Celsius Fahrenheit choice and your hold button as well to keep it held at that particular temperature if that's what you want. No beep when it reaches temperature so you just have to be paying attention or leave it in hold mode, which is obviously much less energy efficient to keep it kind of heating until you remember that you boiled a kettle. Anyway, let's pour with it. It is nice to pour with it. It feels very easy to control, all of those things that you want from a pouring kettle are there. It sort of pours in an expected way. It's not surprising or odd or awkward or anything like that. The little finger holder in the handle. I don't know how I feel about it. Like there's a little space for your, sort of index finger, but it's not like an issue. It's not like I couldn't use this because that thing winds me up or something like that. It's just an interesting design choice to me. So the Brewista is an interesting kettle to me. It's the biggest, it's 1.2 liters. But, it has a minimum fill level of 500 milliliters, which is a little big. Sometimes I don't need that much water, I don't wanna boil that much water. And so having to boil at least 500 milliliters is a negative. It's a little bit wasteful ultimately. In terms of control there's no real kind of physical buttons. You're just touching sort of icons under glass, but it does a couple of interesting things that are worth mentioning. Firstly, it has a just boil button, like a rapid boil. Don't be smart, don't be clever. Just element on until a 100 degrees Celsius. I like that. I think that's useful. It has a timer function where if you were trying to time a pour over, you know, you might have a set of scales that don't have a timer on them, you might not wanna use scales, but why would you not use scales? You've got a heat button for just kind of go, bang in the middle though it's not the most intuitive icon to me in some ways. Next to it is a button that confused me. It's an A with a sort of circle around it. And if I have to break out a manual to use a kettle, have you made it too complicated? Okay, kettles should be a relatively simple thing. It should be intuitive thing. And I really initially had no idea what this was and I don't really enjoy reading manuals. I try to, but the manuals they write, I will say, I think I've complained about Brewista manuals a little bit before, they're quite dense and not particularly intuitive to me. Anyway, complaints aside, it's an auto start button, right? So you set the time on the unit. You set your desired brew time, I guess. And then eight minutes beforehand, it will boil a kettle and hold it at your desired temperature so that you can come down in the morning. And you've just got a freshly boiled kettle, assuming you live a very routine life to the minute almost because I really disliked the idea of holding water for five or 10 or even 20 minutes at a temperature. It's just really wasteful. So it's not necessarily a feature I'd recommend. It's quite a quick powerful kettle. I would just come down and put it on and start weighing coffee, grinding coffee, doing that stuff while it boils. It's a strange additional feature. And then you've got your buttons to set the temperature. As you saw there, I struggled a little bit to hit the buttons. I don't love the absence of physical buttons. Right, I like something to know that I've pushed that isn't it beep. It beeps, quite a lot of beep. Perhaps too much beep, but still a beep. The final nitpick on the base unit is the display. I wish it was a bit bigger and a bit brighter compared to all the other stuff around it, 'cause you sometimes you just wanna see the information that's changing and that is updating that is important to you. This is nice to pour with. Really nice control, you know, nice flow from the spout. Really quite pleasant experience. Balance wise, it feels okay. It's, you know, it's a big kettle and certainly if this was full, I don't know when you'd need a liter of water for a pour over but if you did, that would be quite, quite hard work to work with 'cause it would, it is big. But really to pour with that stream control is super easy. It's a very nice kettle to make coffee with. So the Hario kettle. It's so expensive. Anyway, it has a couple of behaviors that I think are a little bit weird in terms of how you use it. Firstly, when you cycle through the settings in terms of your preset temperatures, it cycles down not up. So you start at a hundred and you cycle down to 15 degrees of 10, which is different to how everyone else does it where they sort of start you from the bottom and kind of up. Also, you can't set it at 97, 98 or 99 degrees Celsius. It's 96, 95, whatever. But that, or a 100. When you're in programming it'll just keep flashing like this and the other kettles once you've left them alone will kick on for you. Confusingly on this one, you have to push the power button again, which feels like what you do to turn it off. Right, you push power to turn it on, then you push power again to make it go. That's just not an intuitive behavior to me. That's just a weird thing to want me to do. As it's heating this little LED goes orange. And when it gets to the ideal temperature, it goes green. Pouring with this kettle is different. The angle of the spout is really quite different. It feels like it's reaching forwards almost into your brew and I do kind of like it. This spout performed very well in the testing. It's a very easy to control spout. Now, I guess this is the electrified version of a kettle that Hario have made for a really long time. They've got some pedigree in terms of making pouring kettles, and I think this one is I'm hesitant to say it, but it is kind of the nicest one to pour with. Controlling the flow is really easy. The quality of flow is very good. The angle of the spout is different to the others and that might really put you off if you've never used a kettle like this and you're used to the other style, but I do quite like it. It is a nice kettle to pour with. It's just so much money. So last up is the Stag kettle. And if you've watched this channel, then you'll know I've had this kettle, I've used it a lot. It's been on the channel for awhile. I'm pretty familiar with it and I certainly like it. The base, the whole thing actually feels really nicely made. It's quite intuitive to use. You've got a small display and you've got a kind of click wheel on the side here. On the back you've got your hold switch and your Fahrenheit or Celsius switch. Obviously we're gonna live in Celsius. And to use it, push the button to turn it on. You can scroll around to your desired temperature, let's say 95. And that's kind of be... Now in terms of weird behaviors, not much. There's no beep when you get to the right temperature. But if you set it to a 100 degrees Celsius, when it gets to a 100, it seems to keep trying to keep going a little bit. It seems to keep pulling power. I don't really understand why as if it's trynna overshoot, but because you can't make water hotter than a 100 degrees Celsius at sea level, it can't sort of overshoot to the point where it fully clicks off. It's kind of a weird one. It's fine, it clicks off with all the other temperatures, but a 100 it seems to kind of keep going. Anyway, pouring. Because it has that much sort of slower flow rate, it's a much more restricted neck, it's very easy to pour kind of a slow controlled pour with this thing. So for pour overs, it's quite intuitive and easy to use. Like I said, at sort of a very low max flow rate, it can be frustrating for other applications, but for a pour over, really very pleasant. So at one more thing, a little Easter egg in this. If you flick your Celsius Fahrenheit switch backwards and forwards, it brings up a kind of snack clone called Wormy that lets you, your worm to chase around the screen and eat the fellow logos. Yeah, that's the thing that exists. But, overall as a pour of a kettle, yeah, it's very nice, it's very easy to pour with. Okay, so time for a summary and as you might guess, there's not gonna be one singular winner. There would be one that might suit you the best depending on your needs for a kettle. But let's start at the beginning. The Diguo, the cheapest one by far and you really feel that. It's not very well-made. I wouldn't have great hopes for its longevity. The whole ergonomics of it are quite poor and it doesn't pour particularly well either. So of the sort of eight here, I probably wouldn't recommend this. I know it is cheap, but you can sort of see why it's cheap. The Dualit is okay. I don't have anything really particularly negative to say about it. The build is pretty good. It's a well known established brand. It's decent kettle for a reasonable amount of money, I guess. The Timemore, you know, your frustrations may not mirror mine, but I found the base on this pretty frustrating. The kettle itself is a good little kettle to pour with to make a coffee with, but I just wish they'd fixed the base. The Felicita again, the lid thing maybe bothers me way more than a normal person. Doing this for a living kind of has broken my mind I suspect. The build of the base is a kind of problem for me. The kettle itself is okay, bar the lid. The Bonavita feels like one of the kind of benchmarks in this group here, right? It does what it does. It's pretty simple. They've been around for a long time. It works well. It pours nicely. It's at okay money, it's a reasonable kettle. The Brewista, I like quite a lot, but it's minimum fill is actually a really bit of a downside for me. But, across many applications, if I was making tea, if I was making a French press, if I was making a pour over again, it's one of those kettles that is pretty useful across all of those. I think you're paying for some features you may not want to use, and that may put you off a little bit, but I think it's a good kettle. The Hario, I think it's a really good kettle. It's a great kettle. I think the base is okay. And if you just got used to the quirks of it, I think you'd be fine. But I think it pours really nicely. I think it's probably my favorite to make coffee with it. It doesn't make better coffee, none of these make better coffee, but I like making coffee with it probably the most. But I can't justify that price. And even 150 euros, that's just a little bit spendy. And the Fellow, again, it's a lot of money. It's 150 pounds in the UK and that is a lot of money. You know, it does everything you need it to do and kind of no more, which is, you know, a good thing. I don't wanna pay for features that I don't use. If I had this at home though, it wouldn't be right because I need a kettle that has a faster flow of water. And that for me is deal-breaker at home. Here in the studio, yeah, I'll probably keep it. There'll be a new one of these going to a Patreon supporter because they give me a budget every month to go and buy these things and review them. And then I give them a way at the end of it because I like that. It makes me happy. So have I come to a winner? I'm not sure I have. You know, if I was brewing pour overs regularly and just pour over for me or maybe me and one other person, then I might lean towards something like the Stag. If I was brewing for bigger brews or I needed faster flows, I might lean towards something around here.", "videoID": "Pbel051H7-s"}, {"title": "More Aeropress\uff1a Reusing Filters\uff1f Competition Brews\uff1f Coffee For 2\uff1f Your Q's Answered (Episode #5)", "text": "Welcome to the series finale, episode five of our AeroPress series. And I couldn't let it end without answering all of your questions. So that's what we're gonna do today. You had a bunch, as an audience, of very consistent questions. Lots of you asked the same thing in comments, on Instagram, on the subreddit, And so I'm gonna answer the main questions that you asked. Now, the first question we gonna answer is actually kind of a surprising one to me. A lot of you asked this, you asked can I reuse my paper filters? Is it okay? Does it make much of a difference to taste? And this surprises me for a couple of reasons. One it's the only brewer I've ever heard of people wanting to reuse paper for. Now I know Alan, inventor of the AeroPress is pro doing this. He says you can use them up to 10 to 12 times. I don't know about that. I'm gonna do a simple test. Side-by-side a brand new filter versus one I've brewed with a couple of times. Can I taste the difference? Is it there? Then if it is, or isn't that's kind of interesting. Why you want to reuse your paper is also kind of interesting. I would say if it's saving money, bear in mind, you know goes from being two pens down to one. They're very cheap to start with. I would say if you're trying to save the environment be cautious of how you're rinsing your paper using also hot fresh water to do that. That has an energy cost as much as 0.17 grams of paper does. That side. Let's do the taste test. So in this brewer, it's gonna be a plain brand new paper. And then this brewer, this one. Now you can see it's a little discolored from being used. You can see that there are some fines sort of on the paper. It'd be interesting to see how tastable this is. In a blind test, same dose, same recipe and both will be using the technique that I recommend as the base technique from the ultimate technique video. If you haven't watched that, go and watch that. Then come back. And this is kind of interesting this is I'm pressing now it's actually a bit harder to press through the used filter. It might be because it's a bit more clogged from previous usage, from the fines from other brews but a bit more work. I'll duck out so I don't know which is which and we'll taste. So can I find, can I spot the bowl the way I'm approach this is very simple. I can look for one that has a little bit more bitterness. That would be the clue to me. That would be what I'd expect from a reused filter but I might be wrong. I don't think it's this bowl. Don't think it's this bowl. If I had to guess, and it's not huge. And there's a bit of variation here, but if I had to guess, I would say, it's this bowl here is the reused paper. No. Heart, this bowl. It's a surprise for me. I don't understand why I felt like this bowl tasted different to this one but that's the nature of trying and tasting. They're exactly the same liquid, right? Like that's how flawed the human tasting experience is. Honestly, this bowl it's not very pronounced any of flavors. Now, important caveat here. This filter has been used three today. I don't know how it would fair if I left it a day or two between uses where there would have been more opportunity for oxidizing it. But I would say if you want to use a paper again immediately, certainly for one or two brews afterwards, I think you're fine. That's a surprise for me. I thought it would be much clearer. It wasn't, let's move on to the next question. Now, quite a lot of you asked the question which coffee is best suited to the AeroPress? Or how do I get the most out of floral coffees with the Aeropress? So, you know does it work better with some coffees than others? Can I use espresso roast in it? All of these kinds of questions to me bundled up in one. And here's my approach and my thoughts. The AeroPress is a brewer and it's just a sort of platform for getting flavor of coffee. It has a great deal of potential to mess with your variables which means I think you can adapt it around almost any coffee that's part of its charm. I don't think some coffees work better than others in an AeroPress. I think some coffees are easier to brew than others. I think that's true. But I don't think the AeroPress necessarily suits one kind of brew. I would be looking to adapt my technique to sort of get the most out of a coffee, right? If it's a coffee where what I love about it is texture driven. Then I wouldn't be afraid to use a slightly higher dose, no longer steep time to get at the kind of fullest experience out of it. If it's a more floral coffee that I might want to make sure I'm using the highest possible temperatures and you know, and make sure I'm grinding fine enough to get everything out of that, but actually dropping my dose a little bit to have a little bit more sort of room for clarity of flavor, especially florals but that's not about the AeroPress. It doesn't suit one coffee over another. I think it's appeal is it's incredibly flexible. The next question is kind of a two questions in one or at least two different questions with one answer. So a lot of you wanted to know how would I approach bypass brewing, right? If I want to use the AeroPress for brewing for two, if I want to try and get two cups out of this what would my recommendations be? And a lot of you asked, what's my recommendations for iced coffee from an AeroPress. Then it turns out the answer is basically the same. So in both of these brewers I'm gonna double up my ground coffee dose. So 22 grams goes into each one of these and I'm gonna be steeping a bit longer because I've got more coffee to extract it's ground where I would usually grind it. I could've gone a little finer. I'm happy just to extend time here. So I'm gonna steep for probably four minutes on both of these to get a good extraction of this higher dose. I'm gonna use as much water, hot water in the brewers as I can. Now I know from testing their were 22 grams in with bloom all that kind of stuff, I can get about 240 grams of water in before it starts to get a little bit sketchy. Obviously a lot of that's fun, but still I don't want to go much higher than that. So in both cases with 22 grams of coffee and 240 grams of hot water, I'm missing about 160 grams. That's how much ice I have in this one here. That'll do a lot of the melting and cooling as we brew. And here I'll add 160 grams of hot water to sort of bring it back to a more normal concentration. We'll brew them and we'll taste them and talk about them. We want to melt as much of the ice as possible. That will bring us back to a normal state but worst case scenario, it doesn't all melt. As long as it's cold. That's good. I'll put it into a nice chilled glass with some ice. There'll be a little bit more dilution over time as well. That'll bring us back to that kind of normal strength. It is a very pleasant brew actually. In my experience, you don't kind of get the same clarity of flavor. You get a sweet cup, a balanced cup, a full bodied kind of rich, brew this way, but there's something about it I feel that you just miss out inevitably on just like a little bit of extraction, that means that this is by no means disappointing, but in an A/B test, wouldn't just be missing a little bit of something. But broadly speaking use as much water as you can in your AeroPress and get as much extraction as you can done there before you dilute down later this isn't the only time we're gonna talk about this style of brewing though. So we'll come back to them a bit. The ice brew very tasty, great for summer. You know that texture is there. It's nice and rich and full and a pleasing. It's hot day outside. This is a great way to drink a coffee. It's a great way to produce enough coffee for a couple of people to sit together in the sun and have a nice time, recommended. Now with the iced coffee in particular you can scale this down. If you want to make just one iced coffee for you you could use 11 grams, half the amount of water you usually would. And then the requisite amount of ice in there. It's really the same as the ice pour of a method. If you haven't seen it, it's up here. If you want to watch it. But now we're gonna go back to the topic of paper filters again and ask the question is two papers that much better than just one? A lot of you asked this question should you be using two papers? Do you get a better result? A cleaner brew? I would expect you would similar to the ASA papers that we tested in the previous video of these, two papers would be thicker than one. AeroPress papers are very thin. They're led a lot through compared to something like the V 60 paper. So this makes sense. The question is, is the difference big enough that I can taste it blind? That's always the test. So again, another triangle will come from this. So on this side, we'll brew the one paper on this side we'll brew the double paper, neither are rinsed. And maybe that'll help me move that I don't think doubling the amount of paper is consequential, to be honest, but we'll see. Let's go. In terms of one being cloudier, one being clearer, with a gentle press on both. I don't think it's particularly apparent but will it manifest in the taste? That's the question. So I will, again, step out the way, will set me up a little blind triangle test. We'll see what happens. This is where you start to play games with your own head. Am I looking for a single bowl of a double filtered or a single bowl of a single filtered coffee here? I don't know which is which way round we're looking necessarily. And so, yeah, I have this double option in my head which is if it's just one bowl of a single filter, then I think it's this one. If it's one bowl of a double filter then I think it's this one. I'm gonna go with this bowl here which feels just a little bit cleaner than the others. I will say if I'm right, if this out to be correct I'm still not sure it's worth using two papers. If you're, if you're pressing gently. A harder press would have a bigger impact unquestionably, but for a gentle press is I prefer to use it. I'm not sure I need to, but let's see. That is not an odd one out. That is not an odd one out. Indeed this. This bowl in the middle. No.I can't taste it. I can't taste it. I'll go back now that I know that it's the different bowl, they taste the same. They taste the same. They really do taste the same. I'm just not sure I could recommend using two papers when one does a pretty good job. I'm not sure you get that much of an improvement in terms of cleanliness. In fact, I can't taste the difference. I could with the ASA papers, which is kind of interesting. But with these ones, I can't really, maybe if you're pressing really hard, it might make a difference. But ultimately I would say, don't worry too much. If you're pressing gently one paper is fine. Let's clean up to a couple of quick questions. So one question, a lot of people asked was about metal filters. They said do I need to grind differently to use metal filter? And I would say, no. if you're using the technique that I recommend or even if you're using an inverted method, no, essentially the extractions really, really being done by the infusion stage a little bit is being done in the percolation, but that's about a column of water evenly passing through a bed of coffee. It might be a bit easier to press, you know with a metal filter. And I would not give into temptation to press hard that will make for a silty, a gritty, a cup. But no, I don't think you do need to grind differently for a metal filter. And then the next question, that's a nice, quick easy question is what about scaling the recipe? I did 11 gram to 200. What if I want to drink more coffee, right? We've seen that the AeroPress can accommodate more liquid. So yes, if you want to scale it up to 1450 grams to say 250 to 270 mils of water, go for it. Absolutely should be the same in terms of steep, agitation, press time, all of that kind of stuff. It might take you a little bit longer to press but I wouldn't worry about that too much. Now, a lot of you had questions about these. These are the AeroPress dice that we made a few years ago now actually, and you asked, are they ever coming back? And the answer is no, but there's good news. The original set like this, no we're never gonna make them again. But we did work with the world AeroPress championship for them to make their own custom sets. So those are still available. If you're not familiar with them. The idea is very simple on each of the dice is a different variable of AeroPress brewing. So when you roll them, it produces a recipe for you. You can roll a little bit over 7,000 different recipes which is kind of ridiculous but that's kind of the joy of the AeroPress. So you'd end up with like, you know your desired brew, temperature, your dose of coffee in water, your method, be it inverted or standard, your grind size and steep time, and some steering techniques. And to put that together, you've got a brew. So they're really fun, but we're never gonna make them again, but there are a different set available. I'll leave a link down the description below for those of you who are still curious. Now there is one very big question left to answer. Why is my technique so different from the AeroPress championship style techniques? Those are often very different in terms of dose, all of that kind of stuff to what I'm doing. So why? Why am I so far away from that? Are those better, worse? What do I think? We'll touch on that after a couple of things. firstly, this video has a sponsor so it means there's giveaway. We're gonna give away another 25 AeroPresses. It's open to pretty much anyone anywhere in the world that we can get an AeroPress to. If you don't have an AeroPress you need one just enter.

Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So here's our last side by side brew of the series. Now I'll be brewing my technique. 11 grams of coffee, 200 grams of water over here. We've got 30 grams of coffee, a lot more coffee. This will go in with less water only 100 grams of water. We'll steep for 40, 45 seconds. We'll probably do it inverted. That's very common. We'll flip, we'll press quite gently. And then we'll dilute that liquid down with maybe 100 grams of water afterwards. I don't want to pick one person and feel like I'm singling them out. This style of brewing is very common of this kind of high dose, less liquid in the brewer dilution afterwards. So let's get these going and then we can have a little taste, Competition brew in a, my star brew. Now obviously with a very large dose of coffee anything from that coffee that's easily dissolved. There'll be a lot of that in there. So you'll have a high concentration of certain things. It is highly aromatic as a kind of cup goes. This does not smell as intense, but again, that's not particularly surprising. There's three times more coffee nearly went into this cup than this cup little taste. Pleasant, nice acidity. It's again jam packed full of flavor has a kind of sweetness to it. That's quite pleasant. Let's compare it with this. Now for me there's a kind of softness to this cup in comparison to this one, this one's a little kind of sharper, spikier, punchier in a way. That's definitely desirable I think at a competition where you're trying to stand out from the crowd constantly. This style of brewing definitely creates a kind of punchier, bigger almost caricatured version of that coffee. And if you're starting with really great coffee you're inevitably gonna amplify some of those very positive traits. This style of brew is a little softer, a little calmer almost, but it's also less fatiguing. I could imagine drinking a big full cup of this and still wanting more coffee being satisfied, but also wanting more. This comparatively is a little bit more fatiguing to me. To drink a lot of this would kind of blow out my palette. It would leave me kind of overwhelmed. I would kind of, a cup, maybe. And then done, you know, and obviously caffeine is highly water soluble. I don't think you've completely extract caffeine, you know in this kind of a brew method, but this will have a lot more caffeine in it than this one here will. And that matters to me. And so I think this is fun. I think this is interesting. It's a great way to sort of turn up some of the characteristics of a coffee. I don't necessarily think you have to go all the way to an extreme of 30 grams, you know, in the brewer. I think you could do it with 20 and actually have quite a good result and you know chewing your a little bit more to have a kind of punchier, more character for a cup. But I just really like the balance and complexity and just satisfaction of this style of brew. I just think it's just really enjoyable to drink. It leaves you wanting just a little bit more which is how I want to finish a cup of coffee. I want to finish it a little bit sad because it was so good, but my preferences are not your preferences. And so if you've tried my method and you really don't like it, then that's okay. You should experiment with what you do. Like there are loads of techniques out there. Go check the ultimate technique video. I left links in the description of that video for other recipes for you to try out and have some fun with. And that brings us to the end of this series. Now I know some of you will still have unanswered questions. Maybe in the future we'll come back to the AeroPress again. We'll experiment some more. But I think for now, hopefully these five videos have kind of covered everything you might want to know about brewing with the AeroPress enjoying it more and give you a kind of guide to experimenting for yourself. Discovering more about what you like and how to get there in the morning as easily and enjoyable as possible. Now I'm kind of curious to find out what it is that collectively you'll all demand that I make next. Maybe it's the I see video. Maybe it's the Kalita Wave technique.", "videoID": "DlaEwef6MTg"}, {"title": "The Best Espresso Machine Under \u00a31,500", "text": "Welcome to today's video. Today, we're going to be looking for the best espresso machine under \u00a31500. Now in the past, we've done under \u00a3100, under \u00a3500. There wasn't actually a lot at the \u00a31000 point so we jumped all the way to 1500 and if you haven't seen those other videos, they'll be up here and in the description. Check 'em out too if you're shopping for a new espresso machine. Now, these machines were picked through a poll of my Patreon supporters. There's lots of choices but these are, I think, a great selection of what's out there. They're all pretty available worldwide, they're all very popular choices and I can't wait to see how they stack up against one another. Let me walk you through what we've got here and what they cost. First up is the Lelit MaraX. This is the cheapest of the machines at \u00a3999 so just scraping in under \u00a31,000 then we have the Rocket Appartamento, another popular choice at \u00a31,225. Next up is the Profitec Pro 500, the most expensive machine today at \u00a31,399 and then we move into the Rancilio Silvia Pro, \u00a31,320, and on the end, the Sage or Breville Dual Boiler at \u00a31,199. These three machines, all heat exchanger machines. They have a single boiler inside them that produces steam and very hot water and that heat is exchanged into brew water on its way to the group. They have what are called E61 style group heads where you control the machine with a little lever on the front. If you lift it up a little bit, it will allow water to flow from the group head, lift it all the way and it engages the pump and you will get your nine bars of pressure. This technology is named after the E61 released in 1961 by Faema and it's still a very popular technology today. These two machines are both dual boiler technology where you have a separate boiler to heat your brewing water and then a boiler just for steam and hot water, you might want to take off for tea or an Americano or something like that. Generally speaking, you know you can control the temperature of your brew water independently of your steam pressure with a dual boiler so if you want a hotter brew temperature, you don't have to increase your steam pressure or vice versa, you can have cooler brew temperature without losing steam power. Here, with the heat exchanger, your brew temperature and your steam pressure are interlinked so if you want a cooler brew temp, you lose steam pressure as your kind of trade-off. Now these machines will be used sort of factory set. I've not opened to the inside of them up at all. Anything that I've changed would be changed through programming. I might have changed their brew temperature through a control on the front of the machine but I'm not going to get inside them at all because that's not really the point of this today. One other quick change, they're all going to use the same basket. I've taken their stock baskets out for the sake of sort of ease, they're all using a VST 18 gram basket when I come to do shot tests and that kind of stuff, it just makes evaluating the machine that little bit easier. I would say in almost every case, I would get rid of the stock basket and replace it with a VST or similar pretty early on so that's what I did. Otherwise, they are as stock sort of factory set. Here's how the review is going to work, we're going to break it down into some sections. Firstly, we're going to talk through the build and the aesthetics and some of the features of each of the machines then we'll talk a little bit more about sort of brewing espresso with each of these machines, how they perform, how the shots taste, then we'll do a little bit of steaming tests, right? How quickly do they steam milk? Do they produce a good texture? And at the end of all of that, I'll come back here, I'll wrap up, and I'll tell you which one I think is the best. So let's start with the Rocket Appartamento, the first of the heat exchangers, the E61 machines, and talk about how it looks. And I think of the machines here, actually it looks pretty good. I like the detailing that they have on the side panel here, I think that gives the machine some character. I think sort of size-wise, feel-wise, it feels compact, doesn't feel too big but it also doesn't feel particularly cluttered in that regard. Obviously, there's a lot of stainless steel here and that is good from a sort of premium feel perspective, bad from a fingerprint and polishing perspective, there's a lot to keep clean here, but it does feel solid, substantial and well-made. I'll say also as a little detail, I quite like the feet, they've done a good job here. Feet are not always done well, I quite like the feet. Styling-wise, you know, with the E61 machines, there's a lot of similarities. The little details around the steam wand valve are kind of nice. Now, let's talk about the kind of usability piece of it as well. And I'll start with a little bit of a weird complaint and that is the portafilter. The portafilter comes with some spouts in a weird position. I really don't like it when you have spouts facing forwards like this, they should be to the back. Now what's weird in the manual, they appear in both configurations, sort of spouts fronts, spouts back, I dunno. I also don't particularly like the little shield cover-y bits that they put on here. It just makes a really important piece harder to clean. So this just annoys me, it's clearly supposed to be this way, it shows it this way round in the manual but it's just, it's just wrong. It makes you push the cups right to the back and I just don't like it. As for the rest of the machine, well, there's not actually that much you interact with. You have a very standard E61 control lever, you know, you have an open position that allows liquid to pass through, you lift to engage the pump and close again and that's your primary point of interaction and with all of the heat exchanger machines, it's the same point of interaction. It is a little cluttered. Right at the back here, you've got your hot water tap and spout, it's not, I don't like it. It's just cluttered in here, it's not nice from the usability perspective, tons of space on the side for the steam wand. Beyond that, well there aren't really any other controls that you're supposed to interact with. With this machine, you have no direct way of controlling the temperature of the steam boiler which therefore impacts the temperature of your brew water through the heat exchange so you kind of get what you're given. Similarly pressure from the vibration pump. Yes, there's an over pressure valve but to adjust that involves, you know, getting inside the machine and doing some maintenance work that technically would invalidate your warranty. It's not really a consumer-facing part of the machine, something you can change or adjust easily. So really it's kind of on-off, open or closed, that's your interaction with this machine and from the simplicity perspective, that's not bad. I don't mind a simple machine but a little bit more control would be desirable, especially at this price point. One more piece of usability and this will come up again and again with the heat exchanger machines in particular, it's heat up time. This is at least a 30 minute heat up time to have everything fully up to temperature and that's a long time. It's a machine where I would want to have it come on in an automated way well in advance of me wanting to make coffee. If I get up, I want coffee and then I have to go and switch it on, that's frustrating. That's too long a time between desire for coffee and getting coffee so the 30 plus minute heat up time for me is a bit of a negative. Last thing to talk about before we sort of talk about, you know, the next machine and then we talk about making coffee later is gauges. This has just one, this has a steam pressure gauge and that's it, you really don't know what's going on with things like pump pressure, you just know how hot your steam boiler is and you can sort of deduct-ish, are you at temperature for your brew boiler? But really there's not a lot of insight into what's happening in the machine, especially when you're brewing. One nice feature though increasingly common across the machines, it is a cool touch steam wand. So from a safety perspective, that's kind of nice, though obviously the very tip here does get very hot. So the Lelit MaraX is the smallest of the footprints of the machines we have here today and that is very likable, right? The more you can get into a smaller footprint, frankly the better. What's interesting to me is where it doesn't compromise, right? It's no more kind of cluttered around the group head than any of the other heat exchanger machines. It still suffers the same level of clutter where your brew activating lever is close to your hot water tap but it feels like the other machines are just wider past these points, rather than having these things further away in a kind of notable way anyway. So tons of stainless steel, feels well-made, well-built, looks relatively neat. I won't say it's proportions are truly aesthetically pleasing, something about it just feels a bit disproportionate in a funny sort of way. It doesn't feel, maybe it's just a bit too tall, I can't quite work it out but it doesn't kind of feel quite balanced in its design but that's a very personal thing so you may feel totally different to me. What it doesn't do well is feet, it has bad feet. Very small little rubber feet under here. It's almost impossible to get your fingers underneath the machine. If you want to lift it and move it, that's extremely awkward. Don't drag it, which I did. The little rubber feet pop off at the back and that's kind of annoying but once it's in place, you should be fine, right? From a sort of user interface perspective, you have a couple of lights. You've got a up to temperature or a heating light and you've got a hot water level light, let you know if your tanks running empty or if your machine is heating up, obviously your main power switch. There is one more switch. And we'll talk about the drip tray in a second. Under here, there's a switch with three positional settings, zero, one and two, and that's for low, medium and high temperatures. It being a heat exchanger, this temperature setting for your brew temperature will impact your steam pressure so know that going to the highest temperature will yield very high pressures of steam, thing to bear in mind. In my testing, the low temperature seemed to be in the region of sort of 85 to 87, maybe 88, and the high temperature roundabout 92 with a little variation depending on how you were using it, how you were flushing it, that kind of a thing. If I was brewing lighter roasts, I would want to be at high. If I was brewing medium to dark roast, I would want to be at medium to low temperatures. So I like that, you know, there is some control of a brew temperature. It's a little simplistic, it's a little brute force, but ultimately, truth be told, I think the changes you would need to make to brew temperature to see a substantial impact on flavor also need to be pretty brute force, pretty big changes so I don't actually have a problem with that. I dislike the lack of transparency in terms of what exactly am I doing? What am I getting? But as a solution, you know, for the money, it's not bad. Now we do have to talk about the portafilter design for the Lelit 'cause it is very strange. You'll see here the splitter on this portafilter is an unusual shape. Now the upside is that as you're brewing, the espresso kind of falls out towards you. The downside is you've added quite a long path of travel in the portafilter, I don't think for really much in the way of a benefit. It's more to clean, it's not particularly easy to clean. I just find it a kind of weird design. I suspect some people really like it, I just find it a bit odd but as with the other heat exchangers, that's the sort of beginning and end of your interaction with the machine. You've got your two valves, your steam and your hot water, and your brew lever and that's really day to day. how you're going to interact with this thing, how you're going to use it. On top, there's a little space on your cup warmer for some cups, as many as you might need at home I suspect, so for me, while it is a compact machine, that's enough space on top for me to be pretty happy. From an information perspective, last thing to note is that this machine does have two gauges which is good. You have a steam pressure gauge and you have a brew pressure gauge. The brew pressure gauge is kind of interesting, in that it seems to show you a little bit more of what's happening inside the brew chamber than other brew pressure gauges often do. Often, you would put a Scace in and you would see nine bars on a gauge and maybe eight bars in the group head. Here, what you see on the gauge is much closer to what you see on the Scace gauge which is kind of interesting. This running a little high for me, higher than I would want based on this sort of information, I would want the gauge to show more like eight bars and again, it's an OPV so you're going to go in and do sort of the hard work of adjusting an over-pressure valve that is awkward and frustrating to get exactly what you want so from that point of view, a little annoying, but to have the information is kind of nice. And as you'll note as we talk about espresso in a little bit, the way it comes up to pressure is kind of interesting too. Anyway, that's the interaction with the Lelit MaraX. So the Rancilio Silvia Pro, obviously based on the very popular Rancilio Silvia, probably the most modified domestic espresso machine in the world. I suspect there's more PID kits running on Rancilio Silvias than anything else and this feels like a response to that. You know, the users were fixing aspects of a machine, Rancilio fixed it themselves. So they did a dual boiler, this is it and it's a lot like it's just a lot, it feels very big. As a machine, it does feel like it lacks just a little bit in the way of elegance. It feels like a kind of brute force solution here and that's from the size and the shape kind of throughout. Now I have a couple of little complaints on the sort of user experience side of things, some things that quite make sense to me. There are things that I like though. But let's start with the rocker switches on the front. Now these are similar than you would find in the Silvia. They don't act in a uniform way and that kind of bothers me. The main on-off switch as you'll see, it's off, it's on, up and down, that's how a rocker switch works. All the other switches don't do that, they bounce. Now the rocker switch I just hit is the steam function and on a Rancilio Silvia, on a normal Rancilio Silvia, that heats the machine up to a sort of higher temperature so you can get steam out of it. Here, it just turns off the steam boiler, which is kind of interesting as a solution. You know, if you don't want to steam milk, then don't heat up a steam boiler. You've got a dual boiler, you can just heat the coffee boiler. I think that's a nice touch, though it's kind of a weird use of a button that has an existing kind of design language in coffee machines, I don't know, it's just kind of weird. Same again actually with the shot button, right? If you start to pull a shot, if you turn it on, it bounces back up. Obviously you can hear the machine is running. But why doesn't the button stay down? Just stay down, be on or off. I just find it a really weird behavior for the switches. On here, you do have your control box. Again, it's not hidden the way it is in other machines, it's front and center. The upside of that is that it works as a shot timer while you're pulling shots so that's a nice use of that, otherwise it shows you the live temperature of the boiler of the machine. There are more functions in here, they're not hugely intuitive in my experience. Like there is a sort of program to shut down and wake up but you're programming how many hours until the machine wakes up again. You don't program a clock and say wake up at 7:00 AM, you say, wake up in 23 hours or something. I find that a little odd, a kind of reasonable usage of a key pad to do a little bit more in terms of functionality but I don't think that's superb user interface design if I'm totally honest. My only other real significant complaints around this side of stuff is around the drip tray actually and this there's two things. They've kind of brute forced another solution which is you can change the height of the drip tray. In here, there are these pieces on the side that sort of vaguely lock into place with little locking wheels and you can change the height of them. Let me just do this now. Oh, there we go, so let's drop it all the way down and now my drip tray will sit lower when I put it back on there, right? Little bit lower down. It works, okay, I don't think it's a particularly elegant design if I'm honest, right? Like it's a little bit brute forced in a way, like it works, it's okay, it's kind of useful I guess. Again, if you were using this as a pure espresso machine, you would want this higher up you know, you don't need to put a big mug underneath but if you're doing a big milk drink, that's an option. That's a smaller complaint than my larger complaint which is the decision to put a lip here, right? Because you can't see how full the actual drain tray is underneath the drip tray grid here, right? So if it got very full, you wouldn't see until it was potentially too late and if it was very full, you've got a problem because I can't, you know, gingerly slide this out, I have to lift it. I have to lift it up to that angle to get it out and if that's full, that's going to make a terrible mess. That is a really weird design choice to me. I do not understand it, it's incredibly frustrating. I think it's a bad design decision if I'm honest because I could foresee someone making a terrible mess of their kitchen counter by accidentally having a very full drip tray and trying to find a way to get it out. You can't just lift it straight up 'cause it's stuck underneath here. Very frustrating. So let's have a little look at the Profitec Pro 500 and it is our most expensive machine. And if you look at it, it's a lot of stainless steel, it's a lot of uninterrupted, shiny, fingerprint-attracting stainless steel. I think it looks quite nice. I think the build is quite nice, it's quite boxy and if that's your vibe then you're probably really quite into this but yeah, it feels substantial, it feels spacious. It feels the closest to a kind of pro machine in some ways, certainly of the three E61 style machines. Few things to talk about in terms of the externals. Firstly, the water tank sits underneath this entire tray, right? So you need to lift off your cups and everything else to sort of get into your water tank. It makes for a bigger cup warming tray, a more functional cup warming tray, but it is also just a bit weird as an experience. I'll say it again, I've said it lots of times; from a user perspective, the clutter around the brew handle and the hot water tap is the same, it's the same frustration. There's a little bit more space between these two valves, there's a little bit more width to the machine but it's a centimeter or two compared to the others so it's still relatively crowded. Now the Profitec being the most expensive, it is, of the heat exchangers, the most feature-rich so on the front, you can see you've got your steam pressure gauge, you've got your brew pressure gauge so that's nice. Both are there, that's good, and then if you pull the drip tray out, here underneath, you've got your control for temperature. Now, as we've talked about before with a heat exchanger, you're controlling the temperature of the steam boiler so 126 degrees Celsius seems very high, obviously that's for steam and you'll lose heat in the heat exchange process so this is to produce, I think, somewhere in the region of like 94, 95 degrees Celsius, which it mostly does. Programing this as an experience isn't lovely. I feel like it's slightly convoluted as a menu and not particularly intuitive but it works fine. They could have done the work in terms of giving you the option to just see your brew temperature and change that and algorithmically have them do the backend work of converting your desired brew temp to the correct steam boiler temperature. This is a little bit more simplistic and I think that's kind of a shame for the money, like I don't care what my steam water temperature is, I care about my brew boiler and I know it's not a direct correlation and you can't just offset it but still, that's not complicated maths, I don't think. That aside, it is nice to still have control over your temperatures and in your manual, and don't lose that, you would have a chart giving you the sort of conversion of steam temp to brew temp. Similar to the other machines, heat up times are very long, changes in temperature sort of coming through have been quite slow so again, it's one you'd want it on a timer in order to have this be hot and ready to go, you know, turning on 30 to 40 minutes before you want to make coffee. Again, it's a frustrating aspect of the user experience of these kind of machines. Feet, reasonable feet, certainly easy enough to move, lift up, deal with that kind of stuff. Not beautiful but certainly adequate. One quick note before we get into actually pulling a shot and talking about temperatures and pressures, I did have the single incidence of thermosiphon stall with this machine. Now I don't want to go too deep into this, it can happen to any heat exchanger machine. It's when the water stops cycling in the thermosiphon properly and your group head goes relatively cool. You need that movement of water happening constantly to maintain a temperature here. That didn't happen and I was getting shots in the sort of mid 80s in terms of brew temperature, flush through a bunch of water and it seemed to correct itself. I know other machines can suffer from this so it's not a particular, you know, negative for this one machine but I do want to point out the fact that it did happen and it can happen with heat exchangers. So let's talk about the Dual Boiler from Sage or Breville, depending where you are in the world and I think this machine is another great example of their particular approach to product design because from a sort of features perspective, it crushes the competition, right? Like on paper, the features here exceed everyone else and what do I mean by that? Well, you've obviously got a dual boiler, you've got control of your temperature to a degree Celsius. You've got a shot clock on here but you've got a clock on the machine as well so you can program your morning wake up or shut down so it's always hot and ready when you want to go. You can program pre-infusion in this machine, both its duration and its pressure. You can use this as a time-based delivery on the pre-program buttons or a volume based delivery on those buttons and I'll show you my one tiny little feature that I think is emblematic of their design, here, the little knob under the machine and you twist it, lifts up, oh, it moves around. How nice is that?! You know, it's a little detail, but it matters. And they do all this at what is kind of in the middle of the pricing for this thing, it's about \u00a31200. Well, how? And the answer, very obviously, is build. Like these are all built out of metal, they're heavy, they're substantial. This... Is not, you pick it up, it feels lightweight compared to everything else. It doesn't feel built with the same quality or, quality is not quite fair, the same kind of heaviness and weight of materials. It's not stainless steel everywhere, it's not that kind of a thing. If I was to describe those other four machines, I would use the phrase pro-sumer, that's quite a common word, you know, it's a professional consumer machine, it's sort of in that middle ground. This feels like a consumer machine, feels like a very nice consumer machine but it feels like a consumer machine. It feels like it's targeting a different audience. It's the only machine that tells me, \"Don't put milk in the water tank.\" I don't know what you make of that but clearly that's happened often enough with their products that they needed to put it in writing where you fill the water tank. That just says they're targeting a different audience with less knowledge, less interest, less investment in espresso but they're still trying to build features that appeal to the espresso enthusiast and that's what makes it kind of interesting. Now one of the frustrations is that their portafilters are very slightly different. They're 58 ml portafilters so I'm using the same basket that I've used for all the others here, but the little lugs on the side here are a different size so I cannot put my Scace 2 into the machine to test its pressure and to test its brew temperature. There's various ways you can try and hack it, you know, you can put a little probe on top of a bed of coffee and sort of sneak it in and see what that's giving you. It's pretty much delivering on temperature, I don't have any concerns there. Pressure, I have to trust the gauge, and the gauge is telling me that the OPV is not set correctly. This thing will hit comfortably 10, 11 bars while brewing, you'll see that pressure decline during the shot as the sort of puck erodes or it creates channels in the puck and finds easier ways through but it should never hit those pressures in the first place. I don't want a machine brewing at that high of a pressure, I want the over pressure valve to bleed off pressures above nine bars. I know you're probably tired of me saying it but I'm also tired of saying it, like this is basics of good coffee brewing and I'm just very annoyed in four of the five machines tested to be raising the same point. Just to wrap on the sort of experience before we pull a shot, you know, it feels both quite substantial and quite compact, you know what I mean? Like it's not a small machine, it's not the smallest machine but it's not particularly deep and I think that matters to a lot of people and a lot of people's kitchens. It doesn't feel as compact as the Lelit over there, but they've done a good job of making it feel, you know, a nice balance between substantial and small enough. You know, I don't think the space saving stuff about putting a tool storage tray here is particularly useful. I don't want to be pulling my drip tray in and out, but you know, they're trying and I appreciate that. So now, we're into talking about making espresso and we are back to the Rocket Appartamento. Now my experience with this has been kind of mixed. I've quite liked the coffee coming out of here, though it isn't brewing in a way that I would really want it to. Once I put a Scace device into here, I began to understand why and primarily it's because of pressure so let's have a look at the brew pressure. 145 PSI on a Scace 2 means that the pump is producing probably something closer to 160 PSI, that's nearly 13 bars of pressure. I don't want to see 13 bars of pressure at the pump, I want to see nine bars of pressure at the pump and once you accommodate losses, I want to see like 110, 115 PSI something there on a Scace 2 like this for a nine bar pump. Higher than that and I will have some additional bitterness in my experience and a much higher likelihood of channeling in my shots. That's to me unacceptable in a factory shipped unit. This should have been fixed at factory, I have no idea why the pump is running this high. Yeah, I can mod the OPV but I shouldn't have to. Brew temperatures ranged from sort of 92 to 94, which was pretty good and they were generally pretty stable. Occasionally, a little slow to recover after pulling a shot, you know, before you get the next shot and a little drop in temperature but overall, no real complaints about brew temperature. Let's pull a shot. Not a bad shot, you know what I mean? It would be better at a lower pump pressure, I would enjoy it more and it would make making espresso easier for me because I'd have less issues with things like channeling most likely but it strikes me as a capable machine that would need a few little tweaks to really perform at its best, from an espresso brewing perspective. Obviously, now the heat exchangers have a shot timer because of the nature of how you turn on and off the grip with that kind of lever, I suppose it could be done but none of them have that function so you'd want to use a scale or something else for timing, which from an espresso brewing perspective is not truly ideal but it's certainly workable in most situations so I would say a capable machine. The only thing I would be aware of is if I was brewing lots of different styles of coffee, I was brewing light roasts, dark roasts, that kind of stuff, I would be frustrated that I couldn't tune my brew temperature around my coffees, right? Like that would be a frustration. Yes, you could run a different heat exchange routine, you could flush more water out, cool the group head down and try and go that way but it's a difficult thing to be accurate with. I would much rather have a machine where I could program my desired temperature and have the machine take care of the difficult stuff. Good shots, could it be better with a little tweak but certainly capable as a machine and for, you know, producing great espresso. So pulling shots with the Lelit, interesting experience. Let's have a look at brew pressure quickly. Now this is a really slow ramp up to pressure. Now you can see on the gauge here, just above nine bars and here, just above nine bars here too. Now, you know, based on this, it's running about a bar and a half higher than I would want it to run but it's interesting to see the similarities between the two gauges, that is definitely interesting. So brew temperature wise, as we said, generally it's been around 92, give or take a degree-ish. Certainly for me, a nice place to be brewing espresso and it's performed actually quite consistently shot to shot which I have liked about this. Let's make an espresso now. The espresso has been very good, brew temperature is good, brew pressure has been high, and you can taste that, again, it's that same sort of thing where you have this additional kind of layer of bitterness that you don't necessarily want or shouldn't really be there. Having this very slow ramp up to pressure, it means you can grind much finer and you know shots have had relatively high yields and very good extractions from that point of view, potential channeling aside, it's made nice coffee. It's set up so the temperature is kind of where I want it to be, it's just frustrating that again from factory, it's not right in terms of pressure, it's running too high, it's running higher than I would want and that really, really frustrates me. It really annoys me. I don't want to have to fix that problem. It should not be on the consumer to fix that problem. So lots to like about this, especially at its price point compared to the others here but frustrating that it lets itself down in these little ways. Let's talk about some good things though. Now, this machine is unusual when it comes to temperatures and pressures in that it does what it's supposed to do right out of the box, right? Compared to the others here, that's kind of surprising. You get the temperature you expect from the gauge here and it brews at the right pressures. Let's have a look. So what was kind of interesting there was that the programming was set to 94, 93 was on the screen indicating it was a little bit cool, but actually brew temperature suggests no, it was in the 94 range. Pump pressure's about 150 in PSI, indicating it's probably 130 PSI at pump, nine bars, eight sort of measured in a flowing working group head as you would want. So from that perspective, it's doing what it's supposed to do and that is shockingly surprising at this point when it really shouldn't be. You know, points here, it's the temperature I want, it's the pressure I want, let's make some coffee. The espresso has been very good. It's been as good as the coffee I've put in and the grinder that I've used to grind it, right? Like a good espresso machine should kind of become almost invisible, it just reliably delivers the temperature and pressure that you want. If it's distributing water properly onto the puck then any complaints with the shot you have really should be pointed elsewhere in the whole kind of process. So from an espresso perspective, it is a solid performer, I have no real complaints at all. Stop me if you've heard this one before, but the pressure on this machine runs too high. We're getting pretty much 10 bars on the gauge, we're seeing at least nine bars in the group, it's at least a bar too high for me. I don't really have a good explanation as to why other than it just wasn't properly set at factory. This is going to be a theme it seems that comes up again and again and again. Let's make some espresso. Now, espresso from this has generally been good. I have no real complaints, the higher brew temp works for me. The shots have tasted a little bit high pressure-y and I wish the pump was running lower from factory, that would make the shots better. Again, it's not super difficult to go in the back and do an OPV adjustment, I just don't want to have to do it. I don't think I should be expected to do it to have an optimally functioning machine, especially for this kind of money. But overall, no real complaints. Performance sort of back-to-back has been okay. You know, with all the heat exchangers really, if you go too hard, too much sort of throughput for them, they will decline in temperature but under normal usage for homes, I've certainly had no issue. It's another very capable machine but it's not necessarily making better espresso than any of the other heat exchangers so to speak, like I think they are all making very good espresso, relatively easily. Now it's interesting to look at this machine with some context of previous machines we've looked at. If you go back to the previous comparison review, the \u00a3500 review, we had the Breville Bambino Plus and that felt in some ways more advanced than this machine with the one exception with that machine, that you had very little control over brew temperature and you didn't have a 58 ml basket. Here you do and that sort of makes it a more espresso-focused machine but the rest of it in terms of how it steams or that kind of stuff just doesn't feel as up-to-date as that particular machine, which just is I think worth noting. But let's make some espresso. So you catch the slow ramp at seven seconds up to full pressure so you've got seven seconds pre-infusion. And then straight up to 10 and a half bars. Dropping now to nine and a half... Dropping down to nine. That's kind of weird. You've seen me use this machine on this channel a bunch of times in the past. It can make great espresso. It again just bothers me that I'm just so close to what I want but I'm not there. Again, the shots taste that little bit harsher than I would want with this pressure configuration. Now on the other machines here on the sort of four pro-sumer machines, you can see nuts and bolts and screws and places to get into the machine and there's a sort of subtext of you may wish to open this machine and get inside. That's not how this looks and feels. There are no screws anywhere that you can see. The message is do not open me but people do and have and they've modded these machines and fixed OPVs or done what's called the Slayer pressure mod that's not for today's video but interesting that you can modify this machine in a bunch of interesting ways. And stop me if you've heard this one before, I shouldn't have to do it, I should not have to spend \u00a31200 and then be tweaking things like pressure, that's not the way it should be. So I'm close to what I want. Temperature tastes good, I've had reliable temperature from it, I just want to fix that pressure issue but it's a capable machine when it comes to brewing good espresso. Steaming-wise, certainly quick enough for me. Steam was nice and easy to work with. It's a single whole steam tip but certainly very easy to work with, got some great texture, no real problems whatsoever with steaming, this steams very well. Now, steaming with the MaraX has been kind of interesting. Now I suspect it's to do with the way that this thing controls its temperature. It has two temperature probes, I presume one is in the steam boiler and one is in the thermosiphon and it's going to control the steam boiler to kind of regulate the thermosiphon temperature and that's meant that actually the steam pressure during operation has varied quite a lot, depending on what you're doing with your brew water too and that's been a bit of a surprise actually, useful to know, but a bit of a surprise. It's meant that I've had pretty high steam pressures and kind of middling steam pressures. Steaming with this is easy, texture has been great, like I have no complaints about it whatsoever but performance has varied a little bit, depending on where the steam boiler is sitting and that's just kind of odd to me, a little unusual. I'm not sure this is really a complaint because even at lower pressures, I've had enough steam to get nice texture, though I might wonder at higher pressures if it would be more difficult to control, just having that much more steam pressure. Overall, no real complaints just worth noting that that has been a strange one. To steam with, the Silvia Pro is lovely, very easy, tons of pressure, not too much flow so you've got lots of time to do what you need to do but enough force in the steam to have great texture in that kind of churning phase in the second half. It doesn't steam with the sort of aggression of a commercial machine, it still feels like you're steaming on a very nice domestic machine. Steaming with this is very nice actually. The tip on here restricts the steam flow enough that you have nice pressure but not excessive flow. That means that you have plenty of time to do what you need to do in terms of texturing and getting your sort of foam created and then rolled around nicely. Overall, steaming with this, very nice, no issues at higher temperatures. You know, I'm at 126 in the steam boiler, about a bar and a half of pressure but yeah, easy, easy to work with. To steam with, super good. Very easy, plenty of pressure, not too much flow so it's quite a slow process but it's easy. You've got time to do what you need to do, good at steaming milk. So let's wrap up. I'll give you a quick rundown of each of them, a quick summary of each of the machines and then I'll tell you which one I would buy if you gave me \u00a31500 to spend. At the beginning, the Lelit MaraX I really quite liked. It's small, it's the cheapest of them here. You don't get fine temperature control but I think you get enough. It brews pretty good espresso. We'll not talk endlessly about pressure but it's kind of fine. I think it's a good value machine, I think at the price point it's out-competing something like the Rocket Appartamento. Here, I feel like this was a difficult bracket for this machine. It's well-built, it looks good, but it does not have the feature set of a cheaper machine or a very slightly more expensive one, right? It sort of sits at a difficult price point where I'm not sure, you know, other than maybe I've got a great deal on it or I have great support and after sales. You know, that might be a reason I would pick this over something else but the lack of temperature control is frustrating for me in this regard. The Profitec Pro 500. Of the machines, of the heat exchangers, it's the most expensive but I think the best performing. Most features, most useful, most usable. I thought this was a very well-made machine, I liked a lot about it, factory pressure aside. I wouldn't feel bad recommending this, it is a good machine and I think it looks nice, it feels nice, no real complaints outside of the whole pressure thing. it did what it was meant to do, it hit the temperatures, the pressures, it was easy to use, it makes great coffee, but the experience of it just frustrated me at times. The Sage, kind of the opposite. The experience is kind of great generally, all the features are wonderful, I think it's a good machine. I just wish it was doing what I wanted it to do a little bit more. But there's no question, if you're just looking at features, this destroys everything else. It has a better interface, it does more, it's more useful, it's just not built the same way as these. It doesn't feel as heavy, it doesn't feel as long lasting, it doesn't feel like a pro-sumer machine, it feels very much a consumer grade thing. And if that bothers you, that's going to be an issue, right? It doesn't feel like it's going to have the longevity of these other machines. Now that's just a feeling, I'm not saying it doesn't have the longevity, it's kind of an experiential aspect of the machine. When you interact with it, it feels lightweight in comparison to everything else. Now, in terms of what I would recommend. Well, firstly, if you have one of these machines, I'm not sure I'd recommend upgrading to another machine from this group. Maybe if you have a Rocket and you're frustrated by not being able to play with temperature easily, then you might consider something like this and upgrade but really you're not going to see a substantial improvement in your espresso, right? If you've got one of these, you've got a great capable machine. If you get those pressures dialed in, temperatures dialed in, you are very capable of producing incredibly good espresso if you've got a good grind. However, to answer the question of which would I buy with \u00a31500, I would be torn between these two. I know this made better espresso and I'm not going to discount that fact, this did a really good job. The user experience of these is a little bit nicer. They're a little bit more attractive looking and depending on lifestyle and how I want to make espresso, these would be my pick but it's tough. And in truth, I'm a little disappointed across the entire bracket by the experience on offer at the price point. Now I know I often have more expensive equipment on here, right? I have, you know, \u00a33,000, \u00a35,000 machines and so is this unfair of me to have higher expectations of these at a lower price point? But the thing that bothers me is that the same components could do a better job if they were set up properly. And if that were the case, if they were all brewing beautifully from factory, oh, then I would really be torn between these two and it would be a difficult decision and it would be about after sales or getting a deal or who am I buying it from? What support will I get? You know, that kind of stuff, that would probably tip me over the edge one way or another or which one fit better into my kitchen. But that's my feeling. Now I'd like to hear from you down in the comments below.", "videoID": "e0kQ5WqjcU8"}, {"title": "Stop Putting Coffee In Everything", "text": "Turns out I have some opinions about coffee and one of them you've probably seen from the title of this video. I feel quite strongly that people should stop trying to put coffee and things. Now I like coffee. I think coffee is a delicious flavor when it's the flavor. Like I like to drink a cup of coffee. I think that it tastes very good. I often think coffee doesn't work very well when you put it into other things. There is some things. Sure, you can put it into milk or milk alternatives, tastes good. You can mix it with chocolate, tastes good. No argument from me there but there has been this increasing trend of trying to shove coffee into other products. Products that really don't make sense. I feel like this started when Lays in the U.S made cappuccino flavored chips to them, crisps to me and everyone broadly hated them. And so quite quickly they stopped making them. And that was very sensible, but it seems to have inspired others to just shove coffee into stuff. And we've seen it on this channel. We know that coffee and orange juice may not work that well. We know that Jagermeister, maybe doesn't benefit from having a shot of cold brew put into it. But the way I feel is if you're gonna have a strong opinion you should test it from time to time. And so that's what we're gonna do today. I've acquired eight different things that you can see here that have coffee in them that I wouldn't really expect to have coffee in them. I'm gonna start with this here. Someone's decided to start putting coffee in red wine. Now already I'm concerned. The very idea is quite unsettling. This is called 19 Crimes. All of the jokes feel very easy at this point. So I'm actually gonna let them go. The whole brand of this thing is based around when the British empire abused the island of Australia as a penal colony in the late 1700. Let me just read the bottle it'll make more sense. This is a liquid ode to our past. 19 Crimes is inspired by those who beginning in 1788, were transported to Australia for a life of hard labor. A pioneering jammy red with a bold coffee finish. It's a bit early in the day. It's morning time here but let's find out. Now I will confess that I lost my corkscrew. I could only find this and it's really for old bottles, old corks it's terrifying to use for some reason. Extremely awkward from this position to be honest. There we go. I'm aware the glass is overkill, I know that. So color genuinely expected sort of a bit more coffeeness in there. It's a dark looking red, it's a... What was the booze on this? I'm not gonna become a wine review channel don't worry, or a coffee wine review channel anyway. Well, the good news is that it doesn't really smell like coffee. There's like a little dirtiness in there. It is made with 100% Colombian Arabica beans but why. A little grippy in the finish there, it's fruity I don't really get a lot of coffee out of this. Like it's a bit rough. Is this what... If you'd left like a centimeter of coffee in a coffee cup and then there was a house party that night and someone couldn't find a glass and was just like, I'll just use this mug and poured that wine in. Maybe that's kind of the vibe we're getting here. Like it mostly tastes of wine but something tastes just a bit off in a way. But it just looks a bit dirty. It's like a dirty strawberry. The slurping is so much gentler in wine. I don't really get it. I don't really understand why you would add coffee to this. Why you would add caffeine to a nighttime drink. If it is a breakfast wine, I'm very pro breakfast wine. This is not a breakfast wine. And the addition of coffee does not make it a breakfast wine. Not a great finish, quite a lot of tan in there balanced out by a kind of big fruity thing. I'm not a wine reviewer, I'm a coffee whatever I am. Nope and never again. So next up is the Jameson cold brew edition, whiskey and coffee. Lot of people asked me to review this and I've been reluctant to. You might say, hang on a minute. Coffee and whiskey are friend. The Irish coffee is one of the great coffee cocktails of all time. How can you say that coffee and whiskey don't go together. I'm not saying that at some point we will look at the Irish coffee on this channel. It's a great drink when done superbly well. The thing for me is if you're gonna put coffee in the whiskey, well you're kind of picking the coffee and making a bunch of decisions about what kind of coffee I should be drinking with my whiskey that I can't ever really undo. And surely fresh coffee is gonna be better than bottled preserved coffee which is what this is gonna be. But maybe it works really well, maybe it's good. There's only one way to find out. Out of the bottle things are getting better. It's got a little musty coffee bananaliness, wish me luck. I feel a little bit like I do about this which is I can't work out if I'm disappointed that there isn't more coffee to it. Because I feel like when coffee and whiskey go well it's about balancing flavors. And whiskey is a big flavor so you need quite a bit of coffee to balance your whiskey. And here it's there in a kind of really awkward level. It's not a particularly powerful flavor. It's just kind of a distraction from the whiskey. It just feels like the addition of coffee is like a nice idea but the execution leaves me wondering why really? From like a sensory perspective, from a hedonic perspective, like why do this? Let me throw in some ice. Here's the thing, if you love coffee so much that you want it in your whiskey then I suspect you love coffee enough that you would wanna control what coffee went in and how it went into your whiskey. Like you might want to an infusion of whole beans into some whiskey that you really like. You like the beans, you like the whiskey. You could totally do that yourself. It just like again, like a dirtied up kinda whiskey. And I'm just not here for it. Let's move along. You might say drinking on an empty stomach is unwise. And I'd probably agree with you, even if it's a coffee based thing. So I should have a snack I think These are chickpeas, cappuccino dark chocolate flavored chickpeas. Which is not what I expected to find. I'm curious, I'm genuinely curious. What unsettles me on the ingredients list is the fact that I don't see the word coffee anywhere on the ingredients list, like nowhere. There is flavoring. I don't know that... I mean, that's a broad charge I guess. Oh no, these look like mini eggs, like the classic Easter treat. Will they taste of coffee? Is this an empty promise? Why am I nervous? That's a journey. That is the weirdest product. Talk about the flavor. It has the classic-like coffee into confectionary flavor. I don't know how they do it. If it's just flavorings or like instant coffee or something like that. It doesn't taste like a cup of coffee. It tastes like if you eat something that's coffee flavored and you put it in your mouth and you chew for a little bit and you're like oh, that's disgusting, what flavor is that? Oh, it's like a coffee flavored chocolate or whatever else. Like it's that coffee flavor. This is a really weird use of chickpeas. Is this like a healthy M and M? If you'd like a commercial like confectionary coffee flavor and you like a little crunch, you might have a nice time. I just feel like just let the chocolate be chocolate, have a crunchy chocolate time. You don't need to bring the coffee in is how I feel here. Why am I eating them still? I'm getting a bit wound up. And so what I need is to calm down. And thankfully someone's made a candle with warm espresso flavor. Now I know you don't flavor a candle, but I'm just gonna call it. If it's coffee, it's coffee flavor. I don't have any matches. The only thing that I have with flame in the studio is the blue flame lighter from my Bripe, so that's how we're gonna roll today. I might have melted the wrong bit slightly there but we got it lit Soothing smells. It smells like I live inside a coffee flavored revel. It does, it's got that... I'm curious, I'm so interested in how you make that. Like where did you get the coffee for this? If you make candles, where did you get that? Did you buy that? Is that a thing that people sell? Maybe I should do a video on where coffee flavor comes from commercially. Kinda go and buy, these big flavor houses. They make flavors, maybe I should go and see one of them and talk about coffee flavor. It smells like hot. Now already I suspect, my brain has begun to ignore the aroma in the room. So I'm gonna treat myself to one of the great smells in life which is the smell of a candle freshly blown out. I see that's a good smell. That's a great smell, everyone loves that smell. Oh, look at it. Wait, where's the fire detector in here? I don't know, I probably wouldn't want this in my house. I feel like I probably smell of coffee most days and then going home and taking a bath in coffee smell would be crossing a line. Fair enough warm espresso. I feel warmed to some extent, but I feel like honestly I don't want coffee flavored candles in my life. Let's move along. It's time I think for me to suffer because, and this is an area that is quite contentious. And I thought maybe I will do an entire video on. It's coffee and hot sauce. Now, hot sauce is one thing and then there's the kind of coffee and barbecue sauce. And so I kinda was thinking about like coffee sauces generally for barbecue or other things like that. I historically have not tied my sense of masculinity into my ability to handle spicy foods. I'm not gonna be like DJ Khaled on hot ones. Now I could be wrong actually. This one, coffee and hot sauces could definitely be a thing. Where's the little test. I've got a big spoon but I'm gonna have a little tiny taste and a big spoon. It smells like hot. Now what's in this? First thing on this list. So therefore the primary ingredient is organic coffee infused white vinegar. Then we've got sweet onions, bell peppers, red habanero peppers, apple cider vinegar with mother, garlic, ginger, olive oil, salt and spices. It's quite an immediate heat. I'm not gonna sweat. I might sweat, I might sweat soon. That's solidly spicy. I can taste quite a few of the ingredients but no coffee. I can taste the habanero, it's quite a kinda clean habanero kinda taste. What else is in you? Onions, yes. Bell peppers, sure. I can't tell if I'm disappointed or relieved, but I don't get a lot of coffee flavor. I think that's a nice hot sauce. Like it's a nice sauce. I don't taste any coffee and I kinda wanna know what it would taste like without the coffee in it as a side-by-side. We're getting towards the end of our journey and I need to talk about perhaps the strangest of the things here. This is Doctor Organic, probably not his real name. This is their organic coffee stimulating hair and scalp shampoo. It's a targeted action. Energizing 'cause my hair is often lethargic. As you can tell it's just lying down almost the whole day. Revitalizing, sure whatever. Stimulating, it's a caffeine kick for your hair and an energizing shampoo with organic coffee, protein packed guarana. Lord knows we all need more protein apparently and a boost of intense Chili. It's got coffee seed extract. I've never heard it called that before. Would you like a cup of coffee of seed extract. Coffee oil, extra caffeine, ginger oil, aloe vera. Stuff like pepper, cedar wood. I can't tell if I can smell chili or if I just still have chili in my mouth. And the question is, should I as a coffee person, as a weird coffee person, should I be washing my hair in organic coffee shampoo? No. Okay as we reached the penultimate destination in our journey, we're at coffee gum. Maybe you're like me in that your relationship between say coffee and gum is that after you've had a lot of coffee, in particular after you might've had a bad coffee, you might want to chew some gum to get rid of coffee flavor. Like you want to fresh in your mouth with some mint. And that's why you might chew some gum. So the idea of I'll chew gum to have my mouth taste of coffee is a new kind of thought to me. So ingredients flavor, there's no coffee in this just coffee flavor. I think I need to get to the bottom of coffee flavor and where it comes from. Now one quick thing, on the back here it says post-chew wraps because in the box, and I have to say I like this. There are these little sheets to wrap your gum in before you throw it away. So you can be a good human, dispose of your gum, nicely, sensibly, responsibly, socially and not be a bad human and just spit it on the street. Let's have a look. Now I'm gonna say it looks a little bit natural. How will it taste? They're all getting their flavor from the same place. The coffee tastes just like this. It's not bad, it's got like a dessert-like quality to it. I feel like you could do like a tiramisu version of this and it would be kind of okay. It's not for me. If anything I'm just obsessed now with commercial coffee flavor and where it comes from. Now, we've got one left and it is the one I'm the most excited about. And it's the one that was the hardest to get. This is not available in Europe. You cannot buy this anywhere in Europe. How it got here I believe for legal reasons is a mystery, but we have some and that's very exciting. Now I feel and I've talked about this in the past that I don't really like putting a lot of negativity out into the world. Like I know I've been critical of a bunch of product here but it really, I feel like it's fair to ask. If you're a coffee loving person should you buy these coffee flavored things? And I feel that we should talk about that. But I wanna put more positivity in the world.

Now for full I don't know commitment to the bid we've got ourselves a Guinness glass, and I'm gonna open, I'm gonna pour in a second. Now these cans have had a difficult journey because you can only buy this in the U.S right now. What's interesting is I looked in the side of the can, this is actually brewed in Dublin and imported by Diageo Beer in the U.S and sold there. So even though it's brewed in Europe you can't buy it in Europe. So apologies for the wrong glass in terms of size. These are 14.3 fluid ounces, could that be a more obscure size. About 400 mils, less obscure, proper money but how is it? Well, that's unexpected. I was worried that like some of these drinks, the coffee would be a distraction but not a featured player. And here that is not the case. This is a featured player. Like the coffee is very present and it's actually quite well balanced with the Guinness flavor. I'm not saying I like it. I'm impressed by the composition of flavor here. Really makes this feel much sweeter as a drink, which I don't know if that's appealing to a Guinness drinker to kind of have the sweetness of it kind of amped up. It has a dessert-like quality to it. It comes through really strongly in the finish with this sort of sweet almost vanillary, cakey, very confectionary coffee flavor in the end there. I mean it's beer with coffee and natural coffee flavors. Now that's the thing. Like I wonder do they have to put any sort of ingredient list on here? I don't like it but it's really a surprising product to me. Like it's just interesting that it exists, that it exists in such a casual way. Because of course you want Guinness with coffee and coffee flavor in it of course you do. A little bit more just to make sure I have a thorough opinion and we'll get no work done this afternoon. It's got the same coffee flavoring in it. It's there on the nose as you bring the glass to your nose, that recurring artificially coffee flavor that's in other products just pops. But then you drink it and there's a different kind of coffee taste and it has a little bit more sweetness. I would not be having a second one of these. I would feel very done at the end of this. Like I would feel like I've had enough. I've had coffee, beer, I'm full, I'm overwhelmed. The sweetness is a little too much. Now I will say in filming this video, I was a little disappointed that Aldi had stopped selling its coffee infused bacon. Maybe if that comes back, we'll have a look at it. Apparently it was really popular, which is I don't know, confusing. But I wanna hear from you now.", "videoID": "H9FtlOq_iK0"}, {"title": "Everything You Need To Know To Steam Great Milk", "text": "Welcome to today's installment in \"The Beginner's Guide to Coffee\" and today's video is all about steaming milk. Here's how it's gonna go. First of all, we're gonna jump straight into the technique, how to steam milk to get a really fine mousse-y texture of foam that you can use to pour latte art if you want to, or just drink and enjoy because it feels so good. Once we've understood the technique, then we'll dive into a few more bits and pieces. We'll cover the science of this stuff. We'll cover alternative milks and different kinds of dairy milk. We'll cover troubleshooting, and make sure that not only do you understand how to steam milk, but what to do if you have a problem and it doesn't go the way you want it to. So let's start right at the beginning with how to steam milk, the technique of it. Now, this is a technique you're gonna use for any machine that has a traditional steam wand. That's generally got a metal tip on the end with one to four holes where steam comes out. Now, not all machines have traditional steam wand tips. So if yours doesn't have that, it might have a weird little plastic wand or some level of automation. Really the answer is read the instructions and do what the manufacturer tells you to do. But if you've got a traditional steam wand, you should be able to create really beautiful milk texture. So where to start. Well, first of all, you're gonna start with cold milk. So we're gonna be steaming in a stainless steel pitcher that's useful because you can touch the side and feel exactly how hot the milk is. We'll come to that. The size of the jug determines the amount of milk that you're gonna steam. You don't wanna steam in a massive jug just a little bit of milk, and you don't wanna seem a lot of milk in a small jug. So, work appropriately. You never really wanna fill a jug above where the spout starts on the side here. That's a good max line for most jugs, in my opinion. You'll add some volume to the milk when you steam it. And the motion of the milk in the jug will drive it up the side of the walls. So if you fill above this line, you risk a terrible mess. So that's your kind of max limit. And you can get various sizes of jugs. This would do like an eight ounce drink or a 250ml drink quite comfortably if you're doing them one at a time. You could probably squeeze two smaller drinks out of it if you wanted to. Then you're gonna add cold milk. Now, we'll talk more about different kinds of dairy milk and non dairy milks later on. I'm not gonna use dairy because I don't drink dairy. I'm gonna be using this because I helped develop it and I really like it and it steams just like milk. Now, for the sort of theory practical bit of what we're trying to do, you're trying to do three things when you steam milk. Firstly, you're trying to make it hot. As long as steam is going into milk, as long as the process is happening, that's happening. So your milk will heat up in a pretty linear way during the sort of steaming section. So that's number one, trying to heat the milk no hotter than 65 degrees Celsius, I would say. I'll explain later on why. Now, there are two other things we wanna focus on when we're steaming milk, and we are gonna look at those kind of one at a time in the process. So the first thing we're gonna do, and we'll start doing it as soon as we start steaming milk is essentially blowing bubbles. To make foam, we have to inject air into the milk. And we can do that using the very tip of the steam wand. When that sits on the surface of the milk, then the pressure of the steam coming out of the wand drags in air from around it into the milk. And it essentially blows big bubbles. And the more bubbles that you blow into the milk, the foamier your milk is going to be. Now, you wanna do this part of the process really as quickly as you can. Not so quick that you lose control over it because you wanna do this with some intentionality, with some purpose, but you wanna get it done pretty quickly because the second thing you wanna focus on, and the second really two thirds of the process is texture. We're gonna use the steam wand like a hot whisk, and it's gonna take our big bubbles that we blew at the start and whisk them down smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and smaller, until they're so small, they're pretty much invisible. And at that point you have what's called microfoam. You have a foam that feels just marshmallowy, and soft, and beautiful to drink. And you've made a great drink. That's the goal. So we're gonna heat milk for the duration. At the start, we're gonna add our air. And then the second two thirds, we're gonna texture that foam. We're gonna whisk it down to the smallest bubbles we can make. Now, let's look at how you do that in a more practical sense. Now, steam wands in most machines have some movement to them. And generally, you wanna have it pulled away from the machine sort of pointing out towards you, kind of a little movement there or there, but obviously don't do something weird like that. I would say just away from the machine a little bit and that's good. Now, to line things up, you're gonna use the spout of the jug. Your steam wand is gonna sit inside that spout. So you can just slide it all the way in. Now, putting the steam wand into the milk, you only want it to go as deep as the tip on the end of the wand. You can see there's always a join where that tip meets the rest of the wand. No deeper than that. There's no point. It doesn't help you out. So just that deep. The last thing to do is to add a little bit of an angle to your jug. Tilt your jug, for most people, slightly to the right, but you can tilt to the left. It depends on the sort of space around your machine. But not dead on, slightly angled. We're gonna do that to help with the second stage where we're trying to whisk the milk around. Before you start to steam, do make sure you purge your steam wand. In many cases, you'll have a little bit of condensation that you wanna get rid of and get that out. In other cases, you may actually have a little bit of air still in the system, and you don't wanna accidentally blow a big sort of uncontrolled bubble into the milk. So just purge the wand, get it ready to go. Then get the jug into place. Now, to explain the process a little bit better before I do it, what I'll do is I'll show you steaming water to explain the position of the steam wand while we steam. Because once you're steaming, it's a little bit more difficult to talk about. So you've got your jug in place, the angle is right, the steam wand tip is just under the surface. And then you're gonna start to steam. And then just about every machine out there, you kind of wanna go straight to full power. You don't wanna go to half power a little bit. You just go on. And I like machines that just let me go straight all the way to on. Now, as soon as you turn the steam wand on, you wanna begin to lower the jug to bring the tip right to the surface of the milk. Not quite above it, but just at the surface. And you'll know it's in the right spot because you'll begin to see and hear and feel air being blown in. You'll be able to hear a kind of slurping noise, feel the kind of vibrations of the steam blowing bubbles in the milk. You wanna do this to create as much foam as you need for the drink that you're making. For example, if you're making a cappuccino, I would say you want a good amount of foam. You wanna have the tip on the surface until you've created, say an additional 50 to 80% in volume. That will give you lots of foam. If you're trying to pour fancy latte art, you maybe wanna add 20 to 30% volume only so that you have a thinner foam at the end of it. Either way, you're trying to get this done really early in the process. And as soon as you've added as much air as you need, you're gonna raise the jug back up and stop the foaming process. All you wanna do is see the milk roll and spin and churn. And that's why we had our jug at that angle, to help create that vortex, where the steam is just gonna be whisking and swirling all of those bubbles, smashing them down to be smaller, and smaller and smaller. If you're comfortable, use your hand on the side of the jug. And when you reach the point of discomfort, probably around 50 to 55 degrees Celsius, going on another three or four seconds will get you close to 60, which I think is a great drinking temperature. And another two, three seconds, maybe if you wanna go to 65, which is where milk tops out. So that's the process. And I'll do it again now live and go through in real time how it would be to foam milk. The jug is in, off to a side. Hit steam. Lower the jug. You can hear that slurping sound. And when I've made enough volume. I'm just gonna raise the jug back up, and go into that churning phase. Getting close to about 55 degrees C now. Take the hand off. And stop. The first thing you should do is put the jug down, forget about it for a second. Clean your steam wand to purge it out. You actually want the jug to do nothing at all for a little bit and I'll tell you why. Even the most practiced person can end up with a few slightly larger bubbles than they would want. The process of pausing here before you tap allows those bubbles to get weak and then they pop easily. And then you can begin to swirl the milk and foam together again until you see a gloss finish in the jug. At this point, you can pour this into coffee and create a beautiful drink, and you can pour the milk and foam together because there's enough liquid in the foam that it will pour. If you look in the jug and it has a matte finish, when you tilt, just liquid milk will come out and the foam will almost sit as a raft and sit back from the edge and you won't have a good time. So really, really, really make sure you mix the two together. It should be a gentle mixing motion. Don't be too aggressive. You don't wanna make new bubbles. But you just want to make sure that you've got the silkiest, most kind of glossy looking milk before you pour it into your drink. So that's the process. That's how to steam milk. And really all you're changing for different drinks is how long you're doing that kind of stretching phase for, that kind of foaming phase at the start of the process. Everything else, whether it's kind of a thick mousse-y cappuccino foam, or very thin quite delicate foam you might want for a flat white, it's the same process otherwise. It's the same start cold, add the air, churn it around as much as possible, and stop. That's it. It seems pretty simple. But it goes wrong for people in lots of different cases and we should talk about why. And let's briefly talk about the science of milk foams. It does become relevant later on when we get into troubleshooting. So let's talk about foaming agents in things. And we've touched on these before in other videos, but a quick recap. Now, it's proteins in the milk that are involved in the foaming process primarily. And the way it works is this. They're a little bit like, a little simplified, but kind of long noodles that are all kind of coiled up and wrapped around each other because parts of it really are repelled by water. They are hydrophobic. And they face each other, giving it its shape. Now, when you very slightly denature that protein, and there's a couple of different ways to do it, you can heat the protein up or essentially you can do it through a whisking action. If you think about, say a meringue, that whisking action is actually denaturing some of the proteins in the egg white and forcing the bits that sort of hate water to come away from each other. And at that point, the bits of the protein that hate water are trying to find anything that isn't water. And what we've done when we foam milk is create a big air bubble that's very appealing to the bits that hate water. And so what happens is that the protein wraps itself around the air bubble on that surface, thus making the bubble strong. It's called a surface active agent or a surfactant. And that's what makes milk foams stable or egg white foams stable. In fact, most foams work in this way. Now, what we're doing when we're steaming milk is actually mixing those two things in to denature the proteins. We are whisking with the violence of the steam going into the milk, as well as heating it up. So very quickly, very effectively, we could denature these proteins to the extent that they will wrap themselves around air bubbles. If you're trying to foam cold milk for something, you'll notice it can be done. It just takes an enormous amount more effort. And heat is a really nice kind of shortcut, which is why steaming can happen so effectively and still get such good texture at the end of it. So that's why things foam. And anything that has surfactants in it will foam. And that's why a great way to practice steaming milk is not to use milk, but to use a little bit of water with a drop, literally a drop, of washing up liquid. Let me show you. This is a super good way to practice with as little waste as possible. But really we're talking like a drop. And this, you would go through the same process. You would steam the same way to get a very similar result. So that's the 'why things foam' part, but let's talk about why things may not foam properly. And for that, we need to discuss fat. Now, if you've made meringues, you will know that you should not get any egg yolk into your meringue mix because that will cause trouble because the fat there offers kind of competition to the air bubble. It's not water either. And so the parts of the protein that are looking for not water will happily sort of wrap themselves around fat. So fat destabilizes foams in many cases. There are exceptions to this and it does get complicated, but it is basically true in most culinary cases, and certainly it's an issue with milk. If you steam whole milk alongside skim milk, you'll find it's much easier to sort of foam or essentially make more volume in the skim milk. The air that you put in stays in. Whereas with full-fat milk, you have to work a little bit harder to increase the volume. That's because that fat is kind of competing with the air bubble for the proteins attention. Now, again, in the case of dairy milk, fats are important here because of the way that the fats in dairy milk break down. A bunch of those fats are called triglycerides. You've probably heard that term at some point. It's a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids attached to it. And when that breaks down, you get your free fatty acids and you get free glycerol. Free glycerol in milk is highly competitive with air for the proteins attention. Milk that has been exposed, let's say, to a ton of daylight will foam worse than milk that has been properly stored. So generally, milk foams better the further it is from its use by date because it's the sort of breakdown of these fats that reduce its foam ability. And milk that foams badly or milk that has this issue, you'll hear it almost fizz in the pitcher afterwards. If you lift it to your ear, you'll hear a kind of popping sound of all of the bubbles just popping away. And you'll have probably experienced this. And sometimes dairies say, \"Oh, we changed the feed of the cows\" or some other thing. It's often just poor handling on the supply chain though in some cases, yes, it is indeed feed that changes the sort of nature of the fats in the cows milk. So in some cases, if this is happening to you, you do everything right. And then just these big bubbles appear in the milk afterwards and it kind of feels like it's breaking down. It's not your fault. It's the milk. And there's some free glycerol in there most likely causing you some problems. The fat has begun to break down and there's nothing you can do to make that steam any better. There's nothing you can do in terms of technique or anything else. That milk will probably taste completely fine if you were to use it for something, but it isn't gonna be great to foam with ever no matter what you wanna do. One quick thing about fat that's also worth noting is that fat affects flavor release in a drink. A full-fat cappuccino will have a different flavor profile to a skim milk cappuccino. In a skim milk cappuccino, you'll have a strong burst of coffee flavor that won't really linger. But with a higher fat content in the drink, you'll have a less intense release of flavor that goes on for a lot longer. And I think that's kind of an interesting aspect of how fat influences flavor. So now we need to talk about temperature because I've given guidance on temperature. I've said 55 is a kind of good starting point to be turning it off from. That temperature, it's very drinkable straight away. It's a nice sweetness. But no hotter than 65. And really that's because at 68 degrees Celsius, milk begins to permanently irreversibly change. Think of it like cooking an egg. Once you've cooked the yolk, there's nothing you can do to undo that process. It's a permanent change to the proteins. They've been permanently denatured. Above 68 degrees Celsius, proteins begin to permanently break down, in some cases, literally just break apart and you'll get the release of some things that add some kind of cooked, unpleasant, eggy smells to the milk. And that's unavoidable. If your milk spends time above 68 degrees Celsius, you will break it essentially. And it will not taste as nice. And that's why really great cappuccinos are never really that hot. Now, because of the way that heat affects the proteins, if you steamed a batch of milk and you didn't pour it out of the jug, in fact, if you just let it cool down and put it in the fridge, chilled it back down again, when you steamed it the second time, the proteins will begin to fall apart earlier because they've been affected the first time you steamed them, the first time you heated them. So that's why you can't really effectively reuse milk for steaming and have it taste as good or produce as good a texture. You've just damaged the proteins twice, too much, too many times, and they can't give you the texture or the flavor that you want. Now, the perceived sweetness of the milk is kind of interesting. That's also temperature related. The the sugar in milk, in dairy milk anyway, is typically lactose. And that's designed to be at its sweetest at body temperature, for, I hope, fairly obvious reasons. But the further you get away from body temperature, be it hot or be it cold, the less intense that sweetness will be perceived. So very, very, very hot sort of cappuccinos or flat whites will taste less sweet than pleasantly hot ones. And if you let it cool a bit more, it will get sweeter and sweeter and sweeter. Now, with alternative milks, the profiles of sugars are a little bit different. Sucrose has a different curve of temperature to lactose. So you might notice some differences there, but with lactose in particular, there is quite a distinct curve of sweetness around temperature. Now, I did say we'd talk about alternative milks because they are increasingly popular and common in cafes and in homes, all around the place. And generally the sort of rules of why they would foam and the textures they create are pretty similar. Now, as I said, I have a vested interest here. And in creating a product to foam like milk, yeah, you're thinking about how to use something like a coconut for like a fat content or how to use oat for sweetness or faba beans for a foaming aspect there to create a kind of plant-based alternative. And doing that well is difficult. Making something that foams like milk is difficult, but there are more options out there in the world today. I can't deny that that's the truth. There are things that just don't work as well. If you're testing them out, you'll find that some out there don't foam as well, or don't retain or hold the foam as well. You'll find some variances of texture, of mouthfeel, all of those kinds of stuff. Because getting the sort of fats to work in conjunction with the foaming agents is always kind of tricky, but it feels like if you don't wanna drink dairy, there really are more options than ever. And I would say, you should be able to treat it exactly like dairy in the foaming process. So the last thing I wanna talk about is actually steam wand tips or how to set up a machine to steam well. Because there's a thing that we need to talk about here, which is the idea of almost pressure versus flow when it comes to steam. Many steam boilers are set to a particular pressure. You'll see a gauge that might say 1.2 bars or something like that. That's how much steam pressure you have. And I would say generally, lots of pressure, one plus bars of pressure, is good. And if you're struggling to steam milk, lowering the pressure actually doesn't help you out because that pressure is what's gonna be spinning the milk around. Lots of pressure helps create a vortex in the milk, but you might experience a situation where you're trying to steam just a little bit of milk and it feels like there's just too much steam to work with and the process is over before you've begun. In those situations, that's where you wanna switch out the tip of the steam wand for something like a low flow tip. The pressure of the steam coming out remains the same, but less steam is able to escape. That will slow the process down. It'll give you more time to do what you need to do to add air at the start and to do the texturing rolling vortex in the second two thirds. It's definitely something that's easy to do with most machines. They're relatively universal in terms of threading on them. And for most machines, there are options available for the size of the holes and the number of holes in the steam tip. So if you're struggling, don't reduce the pressure, reduce the flow, change the steam tip. That's my kind of advice for steaming very small amounts of milk. Now, I don't know about you, but I think I have deserved a little cappuccino. So that's what I'm gonna make. This about 150mls. I'm gonna put a shot double in here. We're not gonna get into recipes today. That is gonna be a separate episode of \"The Beginner's Guide to Coffee\" where we'll go through all of the kind of key espresso based drinks and cover off the kind of recipes and recommendations around those kinds of things. But in this case, I'm gonna pull a shot, steam some milk, and pour a delicious drink. Just the texture of well foamed milk is just a wonderful thing to drink. But now I wanna hear from you down in the comments below.", "videoID": "oaKRBBpA4fw"}, {"title": "Coffee Pods Are Good For The Planet Now\uff1f!", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about the fact that apparently coffee pods are now better for the environment than traditional filter brewed coffee which seems surprising, it is surprising, let's talk about it. So the way it all started was a bunch of academics in Quebec published an article that's basically a blog post, on a website called The Conversation, that was then excitedly picked up by a bunch of media outlets and sort of breathlessly regurgitated. The BBC going with Coffee Pod Carbon Footprint Better for Planet Than Filtered Brew. I had to look into it because a lot of you sent me this article and were like, is this true? Is this real? Does this make any sense? And a lot of coffee people got pretty annoyed about it because there's some fundamental issues with it. But diving into the research, going right through it, there's some stuff that we should probably talk about because it is interesting and surprising and occasionally a little bit annoying. Quick PSA, before we get too far into it, I do wanna remind you that the whole idea of your personal carbon footprint was invented by British Petroleum to kind of make you feel bad and take the pressure off them. You, through better actions alone, in your home, in your daily life, cannot fundamentally mitigate the problems of climate crisis. We should do better and we should waste less, I 100% agree with that, but we need fundamental change at a much higher level to really stave off the climate crisis that we are in. Just wanna highlight that before we talk too much about your personal impact in how you brew your coffee. So what these researchers have done is a kind of meta analysis, and they've kind of cobbled together the carbon impact of brewing a cup of coffee, four different ways. Now, I would argue that the base premise of this is fundamentally flawed. What they've done is they've said we're gonna brew 280 mls of coffee, finished liquid coffee. So that's like a 10 ounce cup to people who work in the old money. What they then did is looked at traditional filter coffee, and it's important to understand that that is not a pour over, that is a electric coffee brewing machine, we'll come back to that in a second. Secondly, they looked at encapsulated coffee. Now there's a bunch of different coffee pods. This is the sort of Nespresso Vertuo ones. This is the little Nespresso ones. These are Jacobs, I don't even know what these are. For this, I think they're using K-cups which are popular in the US, then they used french presses, and then they used instant coffee and they compared the impact. Now, right at the start of this, there was a giant red flag for me when they talked about how much coffee they were going to use to brew that 10 ounces of beverage. 'Cause this is kind of where the whole thing begins to fall apart from me. They said, for the traditional filter, people use 25 grams to make a a 10 ounce, a 280 mil beverage. I'm not sure that they do. Then they took a K-Cup which had about 14 grams of coffee inside, which is a lot less than 25 grams, already kind of weird. Then they took 17 grams of coffee for the french press. Okay, maybe a little bit more normal. And then soluble coffee, instant coffee, confusingly they say 12 grams of coffee. Now what does that even mean? 12 grams of instant coffee? I don't think so, that's a little bit absurd. Now if you read the link in the study, it links you you back to something that tells you that to produce about a kilo of soluble coffee would take about two kilos of roasted coffee. So I'm presuming when they say 12 grams of coffee, they're using six grams of soluble coffee, which is a lot, that's more than most manufacturers would recommend you use. Let me just give you a quick visual demonstration of six grams of instant coffee. That's six grams. No one's making this much coffee with six grams of instant. That's just weird. It should be actually really more like three grams of instant, that would be closer to manufacturer's recommendations. But already, I kind of feel like the people writing this don't have a great understanding of coffee itself. Now if you're a pod drinker, maybe you'll argue this fact with me, but in my life when I've drunk pod coffee, especially little capsules like this, kind of one is never enough, the dose makes the poison. I would find that I would need to drink two or maybe three of these to get a normal amount of caffeine which might be why I'm drinking pod coffee in the first place. And so saying you can make a weaker beverage with a pod than you can with normal coffee, and therefore it's better is a super weird position to take in this whole thing. But then something else kind of stood out to me as being kind of weird. Their base premise is that filter coffee is bad primarily because it uses more coffee and coffee produces loads of emissions when you grow it and all of that kind of stuff. And so using more coffee is worse for the environment. That's kind of a weird argument to make for what I hope is fairly obvious reasons. It has nothing to do with how you make your coffee. If you wanna drink more coffee in the day, you're gonna have more impact on the world in doing so, that's a sort of inescapable and obvious fact and probably not worthy of a blog post. But looking at the actual data, I got more confused, and I went and I read the papers that they linked and I got even more confused at how they got to the numbers they got. Now if you look at the little chart, you'll see that the largest chunk on all of them is the orange section which they have labeled as green coffee preparation. And they said that 25 grams of coffee, used in filter coffee, generated about 150 grams of emissions along the way. And I didn't really understand that. Now I read the paper that they linked to and frankly it is a wild piece of literature. They say that coffee can be really bad, it can be up to 15.3 kilos of emissions per kilo of green coffee grown. But if you do things a bit more sustainably, it goes down to 3.51. Confusingly in the article, it looks like they're using a figure of about six kilos per kilo emissions for coffee production. So then I dug into this, how are these numbers so varied, so wide? Well this paper makes an astonishing leap and they say people are looking for fresher and fresher coffee. And so what's happening is they're air freighting raw coffee from origin to the point of consumption. They're not, especially not commercial coffees, like coffee's grown on large farms in Brazil and Vietnam, which is what this study is looking at. Nobody's air freighting commercial grade coffee, air freighting coffee is ridiculous. I've done it in my career two, three times, always kind of wrapped up in the mania of barista competition. It's expensive, it's ridiculous, it's bad, everyone's kind of chasing the freshest green coffee, sure, but this is not relevant to commercial or normal coffee consumption. So once you get into that, once you strip out the fact that yeah, if you do air freight a bunch of coffee 10,000 kilometers, that has an impact on the environment. Well yeah, all the numbers start to dwindle and there's a really interesting chart here which has a sort of breakdown of the actual production costs and if you do it sustainably and cargo ship the coffee as is normally done, the figure is down to 0.2 to 0.4 kilos of emissions per kilo of coffee, which is a still a really long way from that 3.5 number that they started with, because the rest of this paper adds in more emissions for stuff like roasting, packaging, all of that kind of stuff. The problem is, back to The Conversation, they're adding on stuff like roasting and preparation and packaging and shipping and all of that kind of stuff too. So that emissions data kind of appears twice. And so actually if you had sustainably grown coffee, as you would typically find for specialty that has been shipped on cargo ships as is normal, then your 25 grams of filter coffee might produce, I don't know, something like eight grams of CO2, which is a lot less than the 150 that they're claiming here. So already I've got a big problem with this, but on the plus side it's a mistake that they make for everything across the board here. The other area that kind of left me a little bit confused was the sort of section for landfill. If you look at this, they say that sending 25 grams of coffee, probably less actually, will be about 18 to 20 grams of coffee after extraction, plus the filter paper to landfill, generated more emissions than sending an aluminum pod to landfill too. In most cases, I hope most of us are not sending our coffee to landfill and it's going to be composted through proper food waste channels, that would be good. And yes, if you do let paper decompose in landfill, it does emit methane and methane is bad. But the idea that it's like there's no impact if you just bury an aluminum capsule in landfill because aluminum's inert, which is the premise that they're going with here, that seems kind of wild. But it still seems weird to me to say, yeah, filter papers are bad for the environment, it's better to just manufacture some aluminum, and bury it in landfill, that's quite a claim. Like that's just, that's a lot for me to take in, and I'm not sure I fundamentally agree with that. And I know aluminum can be recycled, and it should be recycled, and it's a very good idea to recycle aluminum. And if you do use these pods, please empty them, send them for recycling, be a good human. But yeah, the idea that these are somehow better than paper, I just fundamentally struggle with that. So you might think, great, I use a V60, I use a normal amount of coffee, I heat an appropriate amount of water, I'm probably fine. And I was thinking, yeah, that should be good news, right? And then something just needled the back of my brain and it was soluble coffee, it was instant again. Because I didn't understand how instant could be sort of low impact from an energy consumption perspective. If you make a filter coffee, that's the first time that you're brewing that coffee. With instant coffee, that's actually the second time that you're heating water and brewing that coffee. To make instant coffee, you take a bunch of ground coffee you extract it incredibly aggressively, I'll touch on that in a second. Then you would take that liquid, perhaps concentrate it further, and then you would spray dry it or freeze dry it, ship it around the world, and then you would then heat water a second time and brew it kind of a second time or kind of reconstitute it, 'cause it's just a freeze dried product. I thought that would be bad. But I looked into it and there are papers analyzing this kind of stuff, it does get kind of interesting. And it turns out because instant coffee is so efficient in a whole bunch of ways, it's nothing like the energy impact that I expected. Now when I brew a filter coffee, I might get 20 to maybe 25% of the grounds dissolved in the cup down below. And the limit is typically considered to be about 30%. The rest is just not soluble, unless you've got the fancy toys, and instant manufacturers can basically break down the insoluble material to make it soluble and get their yield all the way up to 50% which is how two kilos of coffee can become one kilo of instant coffee, that's amazing. You're basically taking stuff that has no real flavor, it's kind of a bulking agent, but it is extraction and that's a thing. And because they do it so intensely and at such high concentrations, per gram of instant, the energy usage is actually pretty low. And so when you reheat it later, it's kind of not that bad. And that surprised me a great deal. Speaking of heating water, and this is the other thing that we need to talk about, pod machines do have an irritating advantage. Let me get one real quick. This is an Nespresso pod machine. It's a company called Morning, it's a fancy one, it's very nice if you like that sort of thing. But the way that these things generally work is very clever. They have a small heating block inside them, and because they're only gonna heat a small amount of water to brew this little pod, they get hot really quickly without drawing loads and loads of energy. Cheaper Nespresso machines never really get to higher temperatures either, they're not particularly temperature stable. But then let's take a a nice fancy espresso machine, that might take 20 to 30 minutes of pretty solid power consumption to get up to a stable temperature. This might be there in a couple of minutes. Most Nespresso machines that you can buy will go from off to brewing coffee in under two minutes. That's a lot faster than 20 to 30. But then you dial in your espresso blend, maybe the first shot runs a little fast, you wanna make it again, all of that waste adds up. And very quickly the waste of brewing espresso at home is really a big deal. So if you're dialing in over and over, there are emissions associated with that waste. But as I've said, nowhere near the emissions claimed I think, by this article in the conversation. Ultimately, the takeaways from this are you should be mindful about the coffee that you brew. And yes, conventionally grown coffee, coffee grown on very large farms in full sun that needs loads of irrigation and fertilizer, as you might find in larger farms in Brazil and Vietnam, that will have a harder impact on the environment than specialty coffee grown in small farms with shade or kind of mixed crops in there too. Coffee is not a simple thing and if you look at all the papers, no one really agrees on anything. But I think what we can agree on is we should be less wasteful. We should brew coffee we care about and enjoy and take maximum pleasure from because it is having an impact on the world. And yeah, maybe pods aren't the answer that they say it is here.", "videoID": "i8B8wDsORz4"}, {"title": "Understanding Espresso\uff1a Pressure (Episode #6)", "text": "Welcome to the final installment of Understanding Espresso. A series where we've gone through each of the variables in espresso making and looked at how to use them, how they impact your espresso making. In order to sort of understand the process of dialing in better and to make more delicious coffee. Now, this last episode is one that I didn't actually plan to make at the beginning. I was gonna stick to sort of the basics of kind of coffee in, coffee out, grind size, that kind of stuff, brew temperature. Here I think it's important that we talk about pressure. It's been a growing conversation in coffee. It did reach a bit of a fervour pitch a few years ago, it's calmed down a bit since then. And the conversation has moved from pressure to some extent to flow. We will touch on that in a little bit, but to start us off I'm gonna go back to the beginning. A kind of quick history of pressure in espresso brewing. The first espresso machines operated at relatively low pressures. They would boil water, trap that steam and use that pent-up steam pressure to push the boiling water through coffee. Maybe one to two bars of pressure was kind of where they were operating but this meant you could brew coffee quicker than you ever could before. And puck, that combination of quick and pressing is where espresso got its name from. Now the big innovation for sort of modernist espresso came from Achille Gaggia's machine in 1949. Here he made a massive leap in pressure. Now, pressures had been increasing in various innovations in machines running up to this, but no one had gotten near the pressures that he achieved with his spring lever. And here you had a lever that you pulled down, this compressed a big spring, allowed water into a brew chamber and then when you released the lever, that spring expanding, pushed that water through the coffee. And here was the first time that we had enough pressure to generate creamer. Now, if you wanna know more about creamer, there's a video up here going into the kind of how's and why's and what's of creamer, but it was a huge moment and a kind of turning point for espresso. The next leap forward in brew pressure I would say came in 1961 with one of the most interesting and innovative machines, which is the Faema E61 which probably deserves a video all of its own, at some point. Now, amongst its many innovations was the fact that it used an electric pump and this provided a constant pressure to brew espresso out, unlike the springs, because as the spring expands it exerts less force. Here we suddenly had nine bars of pressure as a kind of new constant in espresso brewing. The next big leap I would say was probably the introduction of pressure profiling. I think that can be mostly credited to La Marzocco strata machine that came out around 2009, 2010. Here it still had an electric pump, but it was a gear pump. Where you could send a variable voltage and it would spin and produce varying kind of pressures. And suddenly you could create whatever pressure you wanted to, whenever you wanted to in the shot, this was new, this was interesting. And the phrase, pressure profiling came into the collective conscious of coffee brewing people. It was an interesting time, a time of experimentation, of discovery and also enormous frustration because you can change one small part of a pressure curve in espresso shot and it will taste a different tasting espresso. And that's initially exciting, but soon it's difficult to know if you're making your espresso better or just different. I think now we have a more measured approach that comes with a little bit more understanding of what's been going on inside our espressos. And we know a little bit more about how to use pressure to achieve better and more consistent espresso. Now, before we get into the two sections that are talking about pre-infusion and talking about the sort of main brewing section and pressures there, I do quickly wanna talk about nine bars of pressure. This is the norm, this is the standard. This is what most espresso machines are set to from factory in terms of commercial machines, for sure but why is it nine bars? I did once hear that this was considered to be the average of a spring profile, right? A spring lever will peak higher than nine and will slowly decline as the spring expands in a kind of linear version. And someone said nine was the average. Maybe, what seems more likely is that someone did the work and worked out that there's a peak of flow at nine bars. You can read about this in, I think Illie's book which is The Science of Quality and also Scott Roo's book which was an ebook about espresso making. I'll link everything down below in the description. If you do a simple test, you take a fixed dose of coffee, at a fixed ground setting and you brew let's say for 30 seconds and you brew at seven bars, eight bars, nine bars, 10 bars, 11 bars. What you'll see is that as you increase in pressure more liquid gets through that coffee puck in a fixed amount of time. The flow increases until you cross the nine bar threshold. And actually the pressure of the water starts to compact the cake making it harder to get through again. And your flow starts to decrease again. So nine bars is about ish, the peak of flow for most espresso machines, this makes sense. This is the setting that would allow you to grind the finest for a given kind of flow rate. So that's where nine bars comes from most likely. So let's talk about pre-infusion because I think that's the most common place that people think about pressure or variances in pressure. As a definition pre-infusion starts the moment that water enters the basket or brew chamber generally and ends when the machine has reached its peak brewing pressure. In this phase, we're typically looking to get all of the coffee evenly wet before a big force of water presses right through it at high pressures. In theory having a longer pre-infusion phase promotes evenness of extraction and produces better tasting coffee. Now, the way that different machines do this is kind of interesting. And there's some sort of automated or sort of mechanical solutions to this. And there's some more technical solutions to it as well. The most common one in commercial machines is called flow restriction. And here closer to the pump than to the group head typically but not always is a small restrictor. The hole that might be 0.6 millimeters wide and what'll happen here is the pump will kick on all the pressure will get up to that restrictor and a sort of jet of water will get through but it will restrict the flow. And it isn't until water has filled from the restrict to all the way to the park that the full pressure of the pump can be translated through to the park of the coffee. On a standard machine this will usually take six or seven seconds. And after you push go, you'll see the pressure come up on the gauge and then very slightly right at the end, lift just a little bit more. And that little lifted pressure is the final moment when you know, the whole system has become fully pressurized and the pump pressure is now hitting the puck. Different flourishes will produce different pre-infusion levels that they will to some extent restrict the potential overall flow, 0.6 to 0.8 is relatively common. Unrestricted machines mean that you have no real pre-infusion phase and coffee will appear from your spouts incredibly quickly. Generally speaking, I want to see it takes six to eight seconds on a normal nine bar machine with some pre-infusion for liquid to appear. The reason people don't like flow restrictors in lots of parts of the world is that these tiny holes can very quickly fill with scale and block. And then that whole group head is out of action and commercially that's a bit of a headache. So if you're not on top of your water filtration, you're in trouble. Some machines have that flow restriction in the cold water sort of circuit before the water is heated up. And that's sensible from a scale perspective. Once the water is hot it is more likely to precipitate scale. Other machines do have their restriction in the hot side and that is just a bit more of a concern. Neither is right or better, but that's typically what's driving the decision to place the restrictions in different places. Personally, I quite like flow restriction for pre-infusion. It's mechanical, it's simple, it's repeatable. It's the same every single time. And I get enough pre-infusion that I feel like I can grind fine enough and have a nice high yield and have a good time. I don't have to pay attention or think about it commercially in a busy environment, especially it's a great solution. You can go further and have what's called a pre-infusion space or a block that's an extra chamber above the coffee that also has to fill that draws out the whole procedure a little bit more. It takes longer for the system to pressurize. Those are okay, those work quite well. They'll let you go, find out on your grind a little bit still. I'll talk about why in a second but they can be a bit drippy and a bit of work sometimes. There are other solutions which are sort of manual pre-infusion solutions. And that might be situations where a machine will allow you to open the water circuit but not turn on the pump. So typically the group head solenoid will open, water will flow onto the coffee at line pressure. That's whatever pressure your tap water is coming out at. That might be between one and three bars of pressure. You can do this until the first droplets of liquid appear. You can do it for a fixed amount of time. That's kind of how it works. And then you might flick an additional switch and your pump will come on and you'll have that full pressure for the duration of the shot hole until you change it down the line a little bit. There is and I don't recommend using this an additional option which is called mechanical pre-infusion. Here the machine turns on the pump, pumps water in shuts it off, waits a little bit and pumps again. That's quite disruptive because if you built a new pressure and you release it a little bit like the end of a shot that puck will break apart a little bit. I'm just not a huge fan of mechanical pre-infusion where you have this kind of disruptive effect going on there. And I suppose lastly, you've got something like the decent. We can't help, but talk about that machine in this series where you can do all sorts of crazy stuff in a automated way. You can have these kind of blooming pre-infusion where you pump some water in but you don't depressurize the system. You just let it sort of soak for 10, 20, 30 seconds if you want to, and then bring up kind of full pressure. And this again, allows you to go finer, and finer and finer. And there's a number of reasons that people speculate the pre-infusion allows you to grind finer, I'll offer a couple. First, the most common explanation is about fine migration. Here the idea is that the puck has swollen up and trapped all the little fine particles in place and they can't really move through the shot during the extraction. This prevents them all kind of lining up around the holes at the bottom and providing a kind of sandbagging effect. It's a reasonably good explanation. And I think broadly it is true. I think the other aspect of this is that there is still extraction happening in this phase. And coffee very quickly, a good amount of it is extracted. And so if you have a very long pre-infusion you've kind of washed away between probably eight and 10% of your puck before you've hit it with the full pressure. So for me, that's the other potential impact. I'm sure there are other reasons. It's still an area where we're exploring and people are trying to understand, but generally speaking some pre-infusion is considered very good. Repeatable pre-infusion will make your life much easier if you're trying to produce repeatable espressos. Now let's talk about the kind of main brewing pressure that you're going to work at. Now, in a pump machine, this would typically be a fixed pressure. It might be nine bars, you might've set it to 8.5. You might set it to six, it's up to you. But that's the kind of brewing pressure that you're gonna work with. The higher the pressure, as we've talked about to a point the finer you can grind. The downside is at nine bars, that water is under huge pressure and is looking for channels. It's looking for shortcuts through the coffee, the higher the pressure that you're working with the more likely you are to get channels forming. If you say about six bars, you might grind a bit coarser which you think would decrease your yield, decrease your extraction, but you might have an improvement in evenness allowing you to have a better tasting shot. And a higher extraction than you would have done at nine bars. Typically lower end grinders can often be quite clumpy. And if you don't declump them thoroughly as part of your prep process those clumps can encourage channeling a little bit more. The reason people love old school lever machines is that as your shot progresses, your pressure is decreasing, right? So as you start to wash away more and more of your puck, it becomes more and more susceptible to channeling what actually you're dropping the pressure alongside that which decreases the likelihood of channeling. This is actually a really nice solution and it works very well. It's mechanical, it's simple, it's repeatable. The downside of a lever machine is that it's work. Now, there are purely manual lever machines things like the flair. And what you'll find is as you're pulling that lever and trying to hit a pressure towards the end of the shot you'll find yourself pulling or what feels like a consistent pressure what feels like a normal natural movement but that gauge is declining as well. So I think that as you brew that feels interesting and kind of right to do. There are other machines like the Decent or others that can do a sort of automated to declining pressures. And I think that's kind of useful. And there are machines that would allow you to just step down your pressure to something a bit lower on the last half of your shot or the last third of your shot anyway. Now we do still need to talk about the world of flow and how that impact pressure a little bit more. And we'll come to that in just a second. And when do you need to talk about some practical stuff about how you might use pressure or think about pressure, day to day. Before we do that there is a little ad from this video sponsor, which is Skillshare.

Thank you to Skillshare for sponsoring this video. So let's talk about flow. This has become a kind of new topic of conversation that to some extent has replaced the conversation around pressure. And in puck, I think it's because pressure is an input into a brew recipe and flow isn't output and measuring your output and seeing your output and understanding your output allows you to make better inputs and produce better tasting coffee. And that's certainly what we saw with the decent when it kind of popped up onto the scene. People began to see for the first time channels actually happening without having to have a naked portarfilter or a little mirror under your drip tray and sort of looking up and seeing them looking for little channels. Instead, you could see that for a constant pressure your flow began to increase towards the end of the shot because there was simply less resistance there. And that increased very quickly, that was bad news. Now, the world of flow profiling is not really locked in yet. It's in the sort of development phase still, but the idea that a machine could dynamically adjust its pressure based on a variance of flow is really interesting. If my shot starts to channel, the machine could in theory just pull back on the pressure a little bit. So it doesn't explode to that channel so much and I have a more even extraction. This is definitely an interesting part of the future. That isn't to say everyone has to buy Decent as that's the only machine anyone should have. I'm not saying that at all it's a great machine for the right kind of person and a terrible machine for the wrong kind of person. That's true of most coffee machines in a way. But it's just interesting that the conversation around pressure is beginning to move into something interestingly practical that has real world implications. I would say that, yeah, if you have a naked portafilter and you begin to see a little bit of channeling if your machine allows a lower pressure phase switching to that then, would be better than living it at a higher pressure. I would say same with the manual machine, if you're pulling really hard and you see a little spritz come out in a big channel don't keep pulling as hard back that pressure off a little bit, right? You're more likely to have an even extraction by reducing that pressure out a little bit more. Ultimately I think really big variances and pressure during the shot will produce different tasting espresso but rarely better espresso. I think having small changes to flow, preventing channeling or extending pre-infusion to make sure that the puck is entirely saturated. Those are the big wins. Those are the big returns and brewing at a pressure that matches the quality of your grinder, its potential grind output or matches your pug prep skills is another good idea. Nine bars is desirable but it's playing on heart and you can, you know play on an easier mode by reducing your pressure. It's a compromise but overall I'd say you'll get a better espresso but now I wanna hear from you, which aspects of pressure didn't we touch on here. Are you doing something with your pressure profiling routine that's entirely different. I'd love to hear from you down in the comments below. Now soon, this series will be returning to a kind of dialing in where I'll take a different grinder, different machine, different coffee. These will be chosen by my patrian supporters.", "videoID": "po3oGIicu-8"}, {"title": "An Espresso Essential\uff1f", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about this. It's just a little spray bottle you can pick them up for cheap loads of places online. This one's full of water and more and more it seems like it's becoming part of people's coffee kits. So today we're gonna look at why are people using these? What do they do? Is this now a little coffee essential. Now the basis for this is nothing particularly new in fact, I've made a video kind of about the same thing three, four years ago to do with adding a little bit of water to your beans before you grind them to help mitigate static. Take the droplet of water literally and drop it on stir it into the beans and then away you grind. More recently though, these seem to have come into fashion. Now behind me, you'll see five of the finest grinders that money can buy and I'm gonna be reviewing them over the course of a week, culminating in a big head to head but what was interesting to me is that at least half of these grinders came with a spray bottle, which suggests something about this is increasingly essential. Now, just spraying a little bit of water onto those beans adds about 0.1 of a gram of water. So on a 18 to 20 gram dose that's not much of an addition from that perspective. It does massively reduce static and I'll show you in a second just how much difference that it makes. Now, I was skeptical of this being better than what I was doing before but it's kind of easier in many ways. I've fully gone on board with using the little spray bottle over using the droplet technique mostly because with this particular setup I don't have a sink here I'm just having this to hand means I can do a quick spray as I weigh my beans and then away I go. The difference is profound when it comes to using many of these grinders like night and day and I will show you that in a second. But it's not a perfect solution and I'll talk about a couple of the issues that I have as well as answer a few different questions that you might have about using this thing and whether you should get one and whether it would work for you and your particular workflow. So first up, let's do some pretty simple testing. I will grind the same dose of coffee in all five in fact, let's do all six of these grinders and I'll show you a side by side of me doing that with those grinders. You can judge for yourself how much of an impact it has on retention and mess both of which are a big issue. I should add that this is not to comment on the grinders this is just to show the difference of a spray of water versus no spray of water. Okay, so looking at that footage it seems pretty clear cut that a little spritz of water on your beans before you grind them is a very good idea. Helps with retention massively if not completely remove static. So am I saying everyone should use this every single time? No, this is great I do like this it is now how I like to get rid of the static when I'm grinding coffee with any of the grinders that I use but it does have a few issues that may impact your particular workflow. Firstly, if you're something like a niche user chances are you dose in the thing that you grind back into. spraying this with water is a recipe for disaster. Ground coffee will stick to the inside of this it will just, it's very bad. Secondly, if the funnel into your burrs is quite flat, it's not too steep then you can have some sticking issues. Grinders like the Niche or the EG-1 or even the Monolith you can get some beans sort of sticking on the funnel into the burrs, which is a little bit frustrating. The biggest issue I had was probably with the Niche with the Anti popcorning disc in there as well those two things meant that if you'd sprayed the beans with a quite a bit of water one good spray was usually enough then you had some sort of stickage of the beans on the funnel and that was, that was very frustrating so be aware of that. And thirdly, if you do this all the time you will get an accumulation of water in quite a significant quantity around your grinder, around your funnel, around your burr set and I'm not sure that's a great idea. Obviously, burrs themselves are exposed constantly to whatever moisture is in the air depending on where in the world you are that can be quite a lot of moisture but putting in this amount of liquid I cannot say with a hundred percent confidence that that won't cause any problems over time. I think if you're dosing one dose of coffee a day a little spritz is gonna be completely fine but if you're dosing back to back to back to back four or five, six, seven shots, then you might have issues. And from my point of view as a message to all grinder manufacturers this is a great little hack but it doesn't mean you shouldn't be working on a fix for your grinders more broadly. I don't want to have to do this. The ideal workflow is that this does not exist I don't need it. But right now with almost every grinder I've ever used that is a single dose grinder, it kinda do it is a pretty useful little thing. Now, some of you and you know who you are, some of you might say, ha ha, what about the water in the bottle? How much does that matter? And that's a reasonable question I guess. The answer is this, it doesn't matter that much. I tested this with a regular water from the tap, filtered water and distilled water, they all worked very well they had no noticeable impact on flavor that I could discern. A single spray is putting maybe 0.1 of a gram onto the beans not all of it is even gonna go in with the beans into the grinder so your contribution of water here is actually really very minimal, not something to worry about but I'd still want it to taste clean and be free of any in pleasantness but yeah, regular filtered water is gonna be totally fine. Now there's one more little hack you can do with these it's kind of interesting that I wanna talk about but first I want to thank this video sponsor which is Squarespace.

Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So there's one last hack is an interesting one and actually turned up on the decent forums, there's a private forum for decent owners, decent being, this Espresso machine right here. Now someone on there had the idea of taking one of these and spraying the puck with up to a gram of water before pulling a shot, a kind of pre pre-wet. Which seems like a strange thing to do but it had a couple of interesting impacts. Firstly, if you sprayed the puck, let it soak in, when you added more water that water soaked in very quickly in comparison to a dry puck. So perhaps during the pre-wet you had a more effective pre-wetting going on there. Secondly, they saw increase in puck resistance during the shot. Now, puck resistance is an interesting measurement that very few machines would really pay any attention to but if your puck is easier than usual to get through that's probably a bad thing indicating channeling and having a puck that's a little bit harder to get through indicates that you're more likely having a more even flow through that puck. So that was interesting and that was definitely worth testing. I'm not sure it's something you'd wanna add to your routine every single day but if you've got one of these lying around then yes it's absolutely worth giving it a test. And again, you might say aha but now what about the water in the bottle, surely now that has to matter. So I did some tests and it turned out the distilled water had the worst results. These tests weren't conclusive but the taste was the worst and there was more channeling and issues in those shots than there was with filtered normal water and hard water from the tap.", "videoID": "D8zqp3CgcbA"}, {"title": "The Best Cheap Espresso Setup (\u00a3250 Budget)", "text": "How cheaply can you put together a good setup for espresso at home?

So the plan is this, I'm gonna go onto eBay, I'm gonna start bidding for second hand bits of equipment, I'm gonna tell you in a second what my strategy's gonna be about what kind of things I'm gonna buy, a few other bits and pieces I'll probably just buy brand new because they're easy enough to get, but I'll be trying to hit that budget of \u00a3250, which is a good amount of money, but also not that much to go from nothing to great espresso, let's start with the espresso machine. Now with the limited budget, shopping for secondhand means I'm only gonna shop for one model from one manufacturer, I'm gonna go and try and find a Gaggia Classic, and there's a bunch of reasons I wanna do that, firstly, loads of people who don't really want espresso machines often end up buying Gaggia Classics, they're very available, they're in department stores, people buy them online, loads of people have them and are likely to then probably put them up on eBay, so it's a very common machine, secondly, it's relatively easy to modify in a couple of ways that improve its output, and third, there's loads of spare parts available, it's a well-known machine, it shouldn't be hard for me to fix something if it needs fixing. Now, on eBay it looks like if you search for a Gaggia Classic, my budget's gonna need to be around 100 to \u00a3130, your mileage may vary a little bit, and obviously after this video goes up, there might be a little bit of a surge in demand, but if you're patient, you can probably find a bargain, but what about grinders? Grinders are much more difficult, finding a good cheap grinder is difficult to do, I had a tactic of really chasing two different models here, firstly, I was looking for some Sage or Breville grinders, I think they make a very good espresso grinder at the lower end of pricing for good espresso grinders, I think it's about \u00a3200 for their espresso grinder, they do a couple of models, but either one do actually, I think, a very good job, chances are there's a few of those for sale because, again, it's a very popular brand, people tend to buy them and may be upgrading through those, again, there's spare parts available, all that kind of stuff. The other grinder I've had my eye on is one that's maybe not as common everywhere in the world, but it's the Iberital MC2, this is actually very cheap in the UK, you can pick these up for under \u00a3150 sometimes, brand new, so super entry level in terms of good espresso grinder kind of pricing, so that's the plan, I'm gonna buy these two things I hope, get delivered here, and the next time you see me, I'm gonna be unboxing what I bought. All right, first parcel is here, this is the Gaggia Classic, now, I got lucky here, I paid \u00a3104 and 99 pence for this unit delivered, which feels like a total bargain, I was a bit worried actually going into this that I would be constantly outbid, and I was, they were going for like \u00a3150 quite often, but patience paid off, this is probably the 20th unit I bid on and I got lucky or did I? We'll soon find out. Oh, portafilter. Oh dear , now, that's not what you want the inside of your portafilter to look like, so there's gonna be some pretty heavy cleaning to come in this particular episode. Drip tray, very useful. So there's good news and bad news, we're missing a couple of bits, they're not essential, I could still make a coffee on this, it'll be a bit messy, but it could still be done, we're missing the lid for the water tank up on top here, which you really would want to keep dust out, this is pretty dusty, it's gonna need a good clean, we're missing the little accessory that goes on the side of this, now I think they used to be called pannarello wands, it's a sort of weird semi-auto milk foamer, the steam isn't a priority for me here, we're talking about espresso and espresso first and foremost, but if we can get a working steam wand, that'd be good news, and then the other piece that's missing is a little tube that sort of discharges from the solenoid valve, one of the things that the Gaggia Classic has that the others don't have is this three-way solenoid valve, it discharges any built-up pressure from inside the portafilter out into the drain box, if you don't have that, you can get what's called portafilter sneeze, where you take the portafilter out straight after brewing and there's a release of pent-up pressure that goes kind of , and it's quite unpleasant, so one of the niceties of the Gaggia Classic is that it has that three-way valve on there, we just need the tube that runs from the valve into the drain box. Now, what we're gonna do to this is have a little look, first, in the group head here, and then we'll have a little look inside too and see what needs to be done, we're gonna give it a simple descale, we're just gonna use probably a 5% citric acid solution. So the first thing, we're just gonna take out the group head block here, it's not a particularly difficult thing to do hopefully, just to see if it's clean, we're gonna look for signs of scale in this thing or any other concerns. So he's cleaned it, that's good news, gasket looks to be in reasonably good condition as well, so I'm actually kind of hopeful on this front. Let's get these top screws out. All right, inside things aren't looking too bad, you know? In here you can see the inside of these things are actually very simple, you can see all of your controls here, you've got your boiler down here, so one of the things that we can do with the Gaggia that's quite desirable, is that you can modify what's called the OPV or the over-pressure valve, now the way that loads of these machines work is that they have a very loud pump inside them that's a vibration pump, that will produce up to, say, 15 bars of pressure, what you could change is the spring inside here, inside the OPV, and different spring strengths will open at different pressures, bleeding off the excess, allowing you to have your desired pressure and you can buy a kit, and I have bought a kit for, I think, about \u00a318, that comes with several spring choices, so you can brew at six or nine bars if you want to with a relatively simple change to this part here, which I'll do now. So this is my OPV kit, this is from Shades of Coffee, they're in the UK, there's a little installation manual that comes with it that's online, it's very simple, essentially we're just gonna change out a spring part inside here, that's kind of it, so there's a little tube we need to take off it's gonna be a little bit resistant to it, but it will give up in a second. Hello, oh, now we've definitely got some scale in here, which is interesting, you can see that on here there's a very fine coating of scale, so a descale's gonna definitely be a good idea with this, but this is our existing spring. Now, in this particular kit, this longer spring is the six and a half bar one, and what we're gonna do is put it back inside. So our descaler is in the tank, 5%, as I said, that's fairly aggressive, but I should need to descale just once and be done. Good, I just tested this and the light doesn't work, which made me freak out, you can hear a clicking inside, so, you know... Now, I see hot water, which is great news, so it's gonna be difficult to temperature surf this without having the lights work, and I'll check the connections at the back here and see if there's some loose wiring or if it's the sort of buttons themselves that have died, try and work that out. So the path to cheap espresso does not run smoothly. Now, you left me just starting to become frustrated and not understand what was going on, there's been a few issues, but we've fixed them all, so that's good, well, most of them, anyway, firstly, we found a loose connector inside the machine, it seemed like one of the connectors had literally broken off somewhere, thank you to people on Twitter and also aid from Shades of Coffee for a little guidance, that has now been fixed, so the lighting on the brew button, on the coffee button works, so we know when we're at temperature, which is good news, power button still doesn't light up, I'm not sure why, but you can hear the thing come on, it's still workable, then we had a little bit of a leak on one of the hoses, so that needed to be fixed, that was a bit annoying, and then while I was inside, I discovered that while I had thought that all Gaggia Classics have solenoid valves, this one doesn't. I don't know when the change happened, I used to sell these from sort of 2003 to 2005, and a solenoid valve was kind of standard, this one, in the chassis, you can see there's a hole, that little hole is where the pipe would go, so the hole is there for it, there's a hole in the drip tray, but I complained about there being no tube on delivery, no, no, it turns out it doesn't need one, which I suppose is good news, it's one less part to buy, keeps me on budget, I think as far as we're gonna go here, this espresso machine is ready to go, let's move on to grinders. Oh, more parcels, let's come to these little ones in a bit. It's that good traditional eBay packaging. Hopper, never understood this color of hopper. Hello, here we have it, an Iberital MC2, now, I will take the burrs out, have a little look at those in a second, it's a pretty simple grinder, and what a lot of people like about this it's got a small set of conical burrs inside, that's no bad thing here, certainly got the power to be grinding for espresso, it's a step-less grind adjuster on this side, which is good, oh, look, this spins too, how exciting. Let's talk about the other boxes that I got which are kind of part of this whole setup. I did need a set of scales, I figured a set of scales had to go into this setup, and so I spent \u00a314.99 delivered, for a digital set of coffee scales, the coffee-ness is that they have a timer as well as a scale function, so a two-in-one, so these should fit okay under a drip tray hopefully, so \u00a315 I think well spent on our budget. I have decided to put in a basket into this setup, now this I think is maybe a poor use of budget, but I think a sound investment, I think spending on a better basket, I really like VST baskets, but trying to be a bit more budget conscious, I've gone for a Pullman basket here, which I spent \u00a320 on, a VST'll be about \u00a328, so not a huge saving, but, you know, I thought I'd give it a go, this is a 17 to 19 gram basket because I don't think we're gonna be pushing massive doses around in this thing, and 58 mil, so another good reason for a Gaggia is to have a 58 mil portafilter, so that's that. This I'm a bit nervous about, because this makes no sense, I thought, \"I need a tamper.\" Of course we need a tamper, we're not gonna use some plastic thing, we're gonna buy a tamper, And I went around on eBay and I found this, and it was \u00a35.95 delivered in the UK, which I don't understand, 'cause that would cost at least \u00a32 to ship, so someone's made profit on this being \u00a34, now this looked like a proper tamper, it feels heavy. How is that five 95? This feels like stainless steel, it's weighty, it's heavy, this is wood, \u00a35.95. It's a little loose in the basket, not like a huge problem, it's not a perfect fit, it's not like a 58.3, it's a standard 58 mil, but we've got a tamper and we're on budget, \u00a36, you can't complain. So I'll get rid of these, put them to the side, and I'll just have a little look inside of this thing and see what the state of play is. So hopper just seems to just come out, pretty loose, it's not in perfect condition, it's a bit cracked at the bottom, that's not gonna stop it grinding coffee properly, it needs a little bit of love, needs a wash. Interesting, it's not in terrible nick inside, it's a pretty simple thing, you've got a kind of worm gear here on your grind adjuster, which lets it be step-less, so you can see you've got tons and tons of control over your finer coarser situation, and there's two reasons for wanting to take this burr set out, the first reason is I wanna wash the burr set, give it a really good clean, one, to remove any gross coffee oils, and two, it'll give me a better idea of how sharp it is, when a burr set's very dirty, you see this commercially, they act almost as if they're a little bit blunter, and giving them a good clean, stripping off any oils that've built up on them, can improve their sort of efficacy and the kind of grind quality from them, you've got a little plastic sweeper unit in here and there's some grossness at the bottom of that and having conquered the reverse threading on the nut on the top of this, it should be a relatively easy thing to get this clean. Once this is cleaned up and put back together, we'll do our sums and see how I've done on the budget front, have I, you know, come in under budget, a little over budget, and when we taste the coffee, does it taste better than the money I spent? That's the question to ask here, before that, though, there's an ad and because there's an ad, I think we should do a coffee giveaway, we used to do these quite often last year, we should do one now, I'll give away 15 bags of coffee, the link is down below, but now there's a quick ad from this video's sponsor, Morning Brew.

Thanks to them for sponsoring this video. So here we are, we are at the end of this little journey and we have our espresso machine ready to roll, we have our grinder ready to go, I did add one more accessory I didn't talk about before, very necessary, I got a second hand Sage knock box, you can probably get cheaper, this was \u00a313.70 delivered, into the budget, works perfectly fine in a domestic situation, so that's there. Now, I do also have the Sage grinder that I bought over here, now I bought this kind of by mistake, it's a bit above budget, I paid 135, it's cheaper than it's full price of 230, I think, but we won't be pulling shots with this right now, we're gonna pull shots with this thing, so the Iberital MC2, it's a timed grinder, your grind control knob here, it's step-less, which is a good thing, and it certainly goes very fine, I'm quite impressed by that, you can adjust the time, but it's a bit awkward, there's a screw on the front here, you have to put a flathead screwdriver in and twist it, there's no real feedback, not great, but I paid about \u00a3100 for this, so I'm not really gonna complain, now I have dialed in, but I haven't tasted the shot yet, so let's pull a shot, now this grinder is messy, I will say that for it, it clumps quite a lot, I didn't buy a distribution tool or a needle tool, I would probably buy a paperclip in this situation to de-clump this, 'cause it is pretty clumpy. So yeah, as you can see, some pretty big chunky clumps, that isn't ideal, I'm not gonna lie to you, that's that's not ideal, but it is a kind of fixable problem. Now, the Gaggia does have a flaw in that it's really hard to get a scale underneath the drip tray, we could just pull out the drain box, and I'm okay with doing that because I'm okay with making a mess, you may not be, and also know that if you do have a solenoid valve, the portafilter and the group head will both drip for a little while afterwards. Ooh-ah. Looks good. Is this worth it? Is it worth the time to hunt for it? Is it worth gambling on the equipment? Is it worth the effort? Is it worth the stress? Is it worth the money? That's good espresso, that is good espresso, like, yes, it could be better, yes it's, you know, I could get the extraction up a little bit, yes, I would like a little bit more temp control, yes, yes, yes, but that's a good shot, that's tasty, it's sweet, it's complex, it's pretty well extracted, the question is, is it worth it, would I recommend going through this process? If you are comfortable with the risk involved, then I would say, yeah, maybe go for it, chances are secondhand equipment will have problems, you might not have something as extreme as having a leak inside the machine like we did, or having a broken connector to fix, and if you're not comfortable with that stuff, then honestly stay away, save your money, buy something where you're gonna get support, a warranty, backup service, all of those things, they really matter when you're spending hundreds of pounds, but if you are comfortable getting inside an espresso machine, if you're careful and you know what you're doing, then, yeah, I would say go for it. I would say, on the grinder front that I paid about \u00a3100 for this, and I'm reasonably impressed for the money, like, I don't think I've seen a grinder this cheap do espresso as well as this does, I'm not saying it's a flawless grinder, it definitely, you know, has some issues with distribution, it retains a lot of ground coffee inside of it, it's not particularly intuitive to use, but it is relatively capable when it comes to grinding for espresso and that impresses me for the money.", "videoID": "y1LUkfpTtu0"}, {"title": "Understanding Espresso - Brew Temperature (Episode #5)", "text": "Welcome to another episode of understanding espresso, and today we're going to be talking about a kind of interesting topic that is occasionally contentious and that's brew temperature. Now to begin with what I want to do is give you just kind of a brief history, a brief overview of how we've thought about and talked about brew temperature for espresso in the past. For many people that goes back to the old online groups of alt.coffee where people got together and began to talk about the frustrations they had with their domestic espresso machines and the way that they sort of set the temperature for brewing. They found that to be inconsistent and frustrating and so began to put PIDs on them. Now, a PID is a certain type of controller that can be applied for a bunch of different stuff, but here it was a way to manage and maintain temperature to improve the consistency of their espresso. This spread from places like alt.coffee into the commercial world. And one of the people that was driving the conversation about brew temperature very early on was David Schomer. His book was formative for many people, including me, and it really drove a lot of the conversation in the early days of what is now kind of modern espresso. He believed absolutely in the idea of flat line temperature brewing, that a machine should deliver a constant temperature of water from the beginning of the shot to the end of the shot. And he said this unlocked levels of sweetness in his espresso. He really believed that it made it taste much, much, much better, and maybe it did. A lot about this is down to personal preference and we'll touch on that later on, but he certainly drove the conversation. For machine manufacturers this was kind of great. The problem of having a machine just deliver the same temperature of water from the beginning of the shot to the end, that's not a complex engineering challenge, and a number of manufacturers rose to the occasion and came up with great solutions to do that thing. The whole flat line brewing thing was really just a neat easy to communicate idea. It's something you could test at home. Did my machine deliver water at 93 Celsius from beginning to end? And what got lost a little bit at the time was the idea of temperature profiling, a natural curve to temperatures because what I think is much more important than having a flatline profile is having the same profile time and time again. And by having a flat profile, that meant that chances are it was flat every single time you used the machine and that was good, but it doesn't necessarily mean that having some variances is a bad thing as long as that variance is the same every single time. That conversation is still a little bit muddy out there because there aren't many machines that do temperature profiling on purpose. Some of them will have a natural curve, but I don't think there's a ton of evidence around on one curve being better than another. An overall brew temperature, I don't think it quite unlocks perfection the way that we kind of hoped it would back in the day. We did hope that if we achieved this perfectly flat temperature profile that we would have this of a leveling up of espresso and that didn't happen, but we got more consistent equipment and that was good. So today, when we talk about temperatures, we'll talk about either I guess a flatline profile or your peak temperature or sort of the temperature that your curve we'll spend the most time at. If your machine does produce a range of temperatures, don't freak out as long as it does the same thing every time basically. Now one thing we have to touch on again is the idea that's now called temperature surfing. This is how you use your machine to get it to act in a more consistent manner. There are generally two different outcomes of temperature surfing through the same kind of process. By pulling water out of the group head before you pull a shot, you'll do one of two things. In some machines you'll pull out some very hot water that's too hot to use and that will cool the system down. And if you time it right, you can catch it as it comes up to a kind of ideal temperature. In other machines, you'll actually heat up the group head with the water flowing through it and then have again your desirable temperature afterwards. There's tons of resource online for particular machines about temperature profiling routines. I would check out some of the forums like Home Barista, Coffee Geek, and I'll leave some links to those down below. I can't tell you the perfect temperature surfing routine for your machine, because there is simply too many machines, but someone probably has worked it out and they are sharing it in those kind of communities. So let's talk about temperature and taste, because that's the thing we're really interested in, right? Like how does my temperature impact the taste of my espresso and therefore how should I use temperature to improve the flavor of my espresso? Now temperature works in kind of a simple way in that the hotter you go, the more you are going to extract. What I would say is that it's very difficult to make a decision about changing temperature based on only one or two espressos. Temperature, unless it's miles away from being correct, is a kind of tweak, a small adjustment. It'll help you clean up something that you don't like about the espresso. For example, if you have this consistent, slight kind of unpleasant acidity no matter what you've done to change your ratio or your recipe or your dose, then that could be an opportunity to increase your temperature to increase your extraction to kind of clean that up. But if I just tasted one shot and it was a little bit sour, I'd look to something like ratio first before just jumping straight to temperature. But if it's there time and time and time again, then that tells me that this coffee might need a little bit more heat. Similarly if no matter what I do there's a little harshness, a little bitterness to the espresso, then I would potentially drop the temperature down a little bit. It is a different kind of harshness to say dirt in a machine, which leaves a very lingering, burned kind of bitter flavor here. Generally overtemperature espresso just is quite bitter up front and a little bit harsh and aggressive that way. It's kind of rough edged to me. It lacks a kind of clarity and sort of smoothness to it. And I know we're getting to slightly pretentious language, but you know it when you taste it. Now generally, most of the time we're brewing in a couple of different ranges. I would say you're going to brew between 85 and 90 degrees Celsius for darker, more developed roasts. Between say 88 up to say 92 for kind of medium espresso style roasts. And I would brew anywhere from 90 all the way up to 95 for lighter espresso roasts. Now those are pretty ballpark numbers, but I also believe that typically within that sort of window, things should taste pretty good. I know that some people had experiences where they've adjusted the temperature by half a degree Celsius and had a good shot the next shot, but they might've solved a different problem in that second espresso. They might've pushed through a little bit more liquid. They may have had a slightly different mix of coffee beans. It's an organic thing, it's grown on a farm. It's not identical. There's a number of different reasons one espresso will be different from the next one. So you have to be careful ascribing an improvement to one particular change and that's true of all espresso. Generally I would make a change of at least one degree Celsius in order to expect a noticeable change in flavor. So if I was pulling shots at 92 and I was just wanting to improve things, I would most likely go to 94 other than 93, but 93 would be the smallest single change. That one degree Celsius change or around two degrees Fahrenheit. Now many machines will let you change it by less, but I honestly don't think that's a significant enough change to fix the problem that may have come from temperature. And again, with darker roasts, these lower temperatures will prevent you extracting too much in the way of bitterness, in the way of harshness. Whether it's filtered coffee or espresso, there's a correlation. The hotter your water, the more you're going to extract. And that can be a good thing sometimes with lighter roasts or that can be an unpleasant and unbalancing thing with darker roasts. Now, there are a couple of weird outliers. There are some interesting ideas around profiling that I want to talk about and we do need to discuss temperature and altitude, but I've got a couple of things to talk about first.

So up until this point, it seemed pretty arbitrary, pretty simple. Use your temperature to extract more or less. If you've got a dark roast, extract a little bit less to have more balanced shot, but can it really just be that simple? And for the most part, I actually think it is. Brew temperature is not something I mess around with on the daily. I'll typically start with a recommendation from a roaster and see how they're brewing their espresso and that'll be my benchmark. But beyond that, I rarely really change brew temperature to improve the taste of my espresso. I'm using things like ratio or using my initial dose. They just have a bigger impact, but here's a few little things that I think are kind of interesting that are worth sharing. Now firstly, this requires some level of temperature profiling, but it kind of blew my mind when I learned about this. I was once making espresso with a very, very dark roast of coffee, darker than I really wanted to drink and I was struggling to get the best out of it. Now this was using machines that had a brew boiler and a group head that you could control it as your temperature independently. And in doing this, you could create a temperature profile, and here with very dark roasted espresso I had very good results starting with a kind of hotter initial brew and cooling it down in the sort of second, third, and final stage of the espresso. On the T3 unit I was using on a Black Eagle espresso machine, I had the brew boiler running at 105 degrees Celsius. It's pressurized so it can still be liquid at that temperature, but my group head was running down at 80 degrees Celsius. Now the initial liquid that goes from the brew boiler to the group head flows quite quickly and so didn't lose too much temperature. It meant the start of my espresso was actually pretty hot, but by the time that the flow had slowed, that hot water was spending more time in contact with a big thermal mass of cooler metal. That meant that we have this cooler profile in the second two thirds. This meant that my extraction at the start was actually pretty good, but by reducing the temperature in the second half, or second to two thirds, it seemed to reduce the bitterness. So you ended up with an interesting textured complex espresso for a very dark roast without this overwhelming bitterness. By having the whole profile set at a lower temperature, it wasn't bad, it just got a bit boring. And this hotter start just made for a more interesting, delicious espresso. Running a brew boiler at 105 degrees Celsius, it seemed totally at odds with everything I knew about brewing dark roast for espresso, but the results were super interesting. If you want to try it, if you have a machine that can produce some sort of temperature profiles. Talking about brewing at lower temperatures, I will say pulling shots at 80 degrees Celsius is kind of a head wrecker. Think of it in a way as the cold brew of espresso brewing. Now you're not cold brewing, but you have a similar kind of thing. You end up with this very pleasant textured, very kind of low acidity round, desperately dull espresso. But it broke my head, the idea that once I dropped below a certain temperature, I just couldn't really extract a bunch of the acids that were quite unpleasant if you've got a little bit of them. If you brewed that same coffee at 85 to 90, it would be overwhelmingly sour, but that actually dropped away at 80 degrees Celsius. It's not the most interesting espresso of your life, but if you have a machine that can do it, it's definitely an interesting little experience. Don't expect the same level of creamer, don't expect the same intensity, but the texture is generally very enjoyable. Now one last one to talk about is altitude and espresso brewing temperatures. A lot of people know that the higher up you go in terms of altitude, the lower the temperature that water boils at. And if you're brewing at 93 degrees Celsius in a place where water boils at 93 degrees Celsius, is that a massive issue? And the answer actually is no, because when you're brewing espresso, that environment is actually sealed and pressurized. When you're brewing at nine bars, water cannot boil at that temperature at 93 degrees Celsius. It's too pressurized to do so. It's only at very low pressures that it can boil below a hundred degrees Celsius. So when you're brewing your espresso, there are no issues. You can keep brewing at 93, 94, 95, 96, even though your water may boil at cooler temperatures. One thing that will happen though is that as your your espresso liquid leaves the basket and leaves this pressurized environment, that lower pressure tends to cause much bigger, foamier looking creamer. And if you're pulling shots without scales, it's really hard to assess how much liquid you've got cause you just have this much fluffier espresso. So all I would say is that pulling shots by eye and at high altitude is incredibly difficult. Expect your creamer to to sort of be less stable because these bubbles are bigger and less stable, but if you hit your ratios it should taste completely delicious.", "videoID": "QAzE-_ocf1U"}, {"title": "Six Interesting Coffee Brewers (Compared)", "text": "Today we're gonna be comparing six different pour over brewers. And to be honest, I might be in a bit of trouble. I might've opened Pandora's box here and I'll tell you why in a second. Now, I've been accumulating brewers here in the studio slowly. I've backed some on Kickstarter for example and others I've just bought out of interest and it seemed impossible to do six different reviews for each of them. There's so many things I wanna review, so many videos I wanna make. So I thought why not do a nice little comparison. Take six of them, brew them all together and see what happens. And then I started to think about it. And then I thought, how do you compare six different brewers? Three of them use kinda flat-bottomed, wave style filter papers. Three of them use cone style filter papers. They're different brewers, so can I even compare the two? And what grind size should I use? What recipe should I use? What technique should I use? These are all questions that start to bother you if you're trying to come up with some sort of comparison between all these things. But to start with, let's just run through what we've got here on the table. Starting over here we've got the Espro Bloom. Here, we've got the April Pour Over set. Now this is not just a brewer, this does come with a cup. There's a lid for the cup, a saucer for the cup as well. Here we've got the Stagg X brewer from Fellow with the little carafe here as well. Here, we've got the Origami Dripper, the Cafec Flower dripper which is very pretty. And then here on the end, one you may not know, from Hsiao coffee and this is their 50 degree dripper. An interesting little pour over brewer as well. Now, in terms of thinking about brewer design, I think there are probably four key elements that we're thinking about and that are gonna vary across these brewers. Firstly and quite easily is material choice. You know, what is it made from and what are the thermal properties? Does that retain heat well? Does that absorb heat? For example, this has a sort of vacuum wall. It should really retain heat which will be different to the Espro which will be different again to the April. And then... Again most obviously you've got bed shape or bed geometry. These are designed to be more kinda flat-bottomed brewers. We have a sort of flat bed of coffee which requires you be very even in your water delivery. Here, you've got cone-shaped beds and those are a little bit different. It seems possible to get even extractions from these but the geometry is different. Thirdly, is what I would call brewer resistance. If you think about a kind of classic brewer like the Kalita brewer or the Melitta brewers, they often had three small holes at the base of the brewer. That would, to some extent restrict the flow of the water out. This might be useful if your coffee is a little bit costly ground and it would help sort of increase your contact time. Across these brewers, you've actually got very little resistance but, looking at something like this, you've obviously got less open areas in the holes of the Stagg brewer than you would do in the open area of the Hsiao coffee brewer. And then lastly, in terms of things we're gonna think about today, I wanna talk about the idea of bypass in brewing. Now I know in my V60 video, I said if you pour water directly onto the paper, that's not the end of the world 'cause it'll mostly run down the paper and onto the sort of coffee bed and it'll pass through that way. But some water is bypassing the brew. Some water is getting out of the sides of that paper at some point and bypassing the coffee bed. The way that your paper adheres or sticks to the brewer, or in some cases doesn't stick to the brewer, will change the amount of bypass that you get. Now, wave filters are designed to make sure that the paper doesn't stick to the side of the brewer and you know, you've got ribs in things like the Origami or the Flower dripper that do the same thing or in a classic V60. One of the brewers here though, is completely smooth on the inside. So we shouldn't get very much bypass brewing. That's gonna be an interesting design decision. And again, going all the way back to the Espro, you can brew this without paper filters, which would mean that actually all your water would have to pass through the coffee at the base of this brewer which again should reduce bypass. Now bypass isn't inherently bad but it will change the strength and extraction of the brew that you have. And you have to tell your grind setting to the amount of bypass that you're typically gonna get. When we brew these, I think one of the big variants of both brew time and extraction and strength, will be down to bypass. But, we'll see. So to start with, this is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna take the same coffee, same grind, same quantity of water. In fact, same technique and brew on all of them. Back-to-back. And we'll measure their brew times, we'll measure their TDS and then we'll do a little tasting. I'm gonna be using the Fellow Ode that I have modded with the SSP burr upgrade. I probably should make a video about burrs and burr upgrades in general. I should do that pretty soon but that's what we're using here. So you can ignore the dial settings. They're totally different 'cause it's a completely different burr set that lets me grind much finer. I'll be using my V60 technique and I'll be brewing 18 grams of coffee to 300 grams of water. And I'll aim for the same pour time, the same kind of flow rate as I pour across all of the brewers. Now, before we get onto that, just a quick note on filter papers, 'cause that's inevitably a big deal. Now, most of them, not all of them use custom filter papers. So for example, Espro make their own specific shape. You can use this brewer without papers but for the sake of consistency, I'm gonna use their papers. Kalita style papers or Kalita papers, work in the April brewer. Stagg brewers come with their own papers over here. Here, you've got these three conical brewers and you've got three different approaches to sort of ribs holding the paper off the wall. And for that reason, to understand that a little bit more, these two brewers that have the same angle inside and use the same papers potentially, I wanna use the same papers in them. Now I've got the Cafec single cup light roast filter papers here and I've got my box of V60 papers here. The question is, which one should I use on both? And I think I'm gonna stick to the V60 box on both of these which means it's gonna look a little bit funny when it brews. Later on, we'll brew with the Cafec filter papers. But, for now I'm gonna use the larger paper size on this and aim for the same recipe. And that way we'll be able to see how much difference it makes to have the different designs inside of these things, changing the potential bypass or the way that the coffee kinda flows through. I don't know if there's gonna be any difference but it will be interesting to find out. Now, it's time to start brewing. So our brews are all cooling down and while they equilibrate around room temperature, I just wanna talk a little bit about each one and just share a few thoughts from having brewed with them a little bit. I've had most of these for quite a while with the exception of the Stagg. But, I have thoughts on all of them, unsurprisingly. So let's start with the Espro, the Bloom. Off the bat, it had a bit of an uphill challenge 'cause I didn't like the fact that it really really looks like a December Dripper. I felt there was just so much crossover and style in the color of the band around the top here, the silicon. It just felt a bit too close for comfort for me and I didn't like that about it. As a brewer, it's genuinely very interesting. The combination of being able to brew with or without papers is interesting. Having actually quite a large open area, disguised as lots of little holes, is definitely interesting. I know people have hacked this a little bit to put in sort of tea strainers at the bottom to help the papers sit off the base a little bit more. I'll leave a link to some stuff down below if you wanna know more about those kind of things. But overall, I do quite like this brewer. I like the coffee that it makes. And this has the feeling of kind of the hand thrown ceramic kind of feel here. You know, the lines inside, the feels, the shape the textures, it feels very inspired by teawares and I think that's reflected in the cup that comes with it as well and the lid for the cup also. You know, there's been some consideration and some thought put into this. The design at the bottom to sort of keep the paper away from that hole to prevent sort of paper clogging it, is interesting and good. And I know that the recommended brew techniques, touch on this later, are quite different to what I did but it's a pretty thing. If I had a criticism, it would be that when you brew into the cup, the cup's capacity is quite small and the walls are quite thin and it very quickly gets very very hot. So, if you've forgotten to put it on a saucer, picking it up straight after brewing is not much fun. It's just too hot to hold. And at that moment, you kinda miss having a handle. For me it's a small flaw in the experience but overall, very enjoyable. Now the Stagg is a very Fellow product in that it's got a lot going on. So, you've got the main kind of brewer piece here and then you've got two more pieces. One is a little funnel for dosing and that's a nice touch. And then this one is designed to be like a bean dosing tin. I don't think it works very well for that. You've got little dots inside to kinda line up what your dose would be. I don't find that a very good way to dose coffee. One thing I picked up from a Workshop video actually was that it makes a good drip cup. And so when he finish brewing, you can take it off, put it on here and the last couple of drips can go in there and not somewhere else. The thing that sort of stresses me out about it and this isn't unique to this brewer, is that you really do wanna make sure that this thing is seated flat. And in these situations it would be easy if you're not paying attention to have it sort of sit at a slight angle. But, it's very well thought through. Probably the most restricted flow of all of them here though, in the testing I just did, it didn't actually make a very big difference and that's kind of a surprise. The flexibility of the Origami is very interesting in its paper choice. You can brew with V60 paper, you can brew with a Kalita. I think that's kind of cool. Similarly though, where it falls down with this wooden piece especially, is that having it seated exactly level, is actually quite difficult to do especially if you wanna move it around, so you wanna swirl during brewing. Making sure that it's dead set and flat is really important for evenness 'cause essentially, you've got gravity pressing your water down. You wanna make sure this is as level as possible. That for me with this piece is a flaw in the design. Though, it's undeniably beautiful and there's some wonderful colors available for this too. Again, I look at the Cafec and I just find it to be a pleasing object to look at. You know, I think the design inside is beautiful. I was intrigued to see if it would impact brew time compared to the Origami and it did not. Whether it impacts flavor? Much more interesting question. The Hsiao Coffee Dripper is interesting in a couple of different ways. Firstly, it's a 50 degree angle which means that you have to use this. It's a paper folder. So you overlay it onto a V60 paper and it helps you fold the paper into a 50 degree angle. So you'd fold it and then you'd have this kind of narrower cone shape to work within this brewer. Now, the other interesting touch of design in this, is that the way that they've kind of sculpted the top here. It kind of cuts at an angle. And this is designed to I think encourage you to get the sort of spout of your kettle much closer here. Obviously you can make the whole thing the lower height and it would have the same fill capacity on the rest of it. Just 'cause it has a higher wall here, doesn't mean it can accept more liquid but, it's a piece of design that I think encourages a technique in quite a subtle but quite a pleasing way. The absence of ribs inside of here is interesting. It definitely brewed much slower than all the other brewers and there's no surprise there. There was no bypass. And that was definitely very interesting. But hopefully, that should all reflect in the taste which is what we should do now. So we've measured these, we've captured the sort of the extraction data from them. What we're gonna do now is label them. They're gonna get mixed up while I'm not looking and I'll come back and I'll taste and I'll share some thoughts with what I'm tasting. Tastes like something actually didn't go quite right. There's a little astringency here. It doesn't taste like a flow in brewing. It just tastes like something is slightly odd in that cup. This bowl is quite pleasant. It feels a little bit empty compared to some of the others. This one's kind of similar. To be honest, it is pleasant, it doesn't have a high strength kind of to it. But, it's enjoyable. I'm certainly enjoying the coffee that comes from it. This one, a bit more intensity. Pleasant, it's got sweetness, it's got a little tickle of bitterness where I'd wanna be to kind of tweaking my grind maybe. But, it is overall an enjoyable cup of coffee. And here again, it doesn't taste as extracted as some of the other cups. But, it is sweet and it's balanced and it's pleasant. And I do again, enjoy it. Very tasty of the brews on the table. It could be my favorite. Now, if you're hoping for massive pronounced differences between these, they're not there. It is the same coffee, the same grind, the same water, the same approximate contact time but it does vary a little bit. So you can taste some varying levels of extraction here that are kind of interesting. And therefore it's difficult to say I like this because of the brewer. I might just like it because it is more extracted and that's because of the brewer but, if I hit that same extraction with a different brewer would I like that more? This is the Pandora's box that we're gonna do. This is the world of pain of kind of thought experiments and kind of experiment design that becomes very frustrating and very confusing. You know I have this feeling that you'll watch this video and have a complaint about some aspect of the testing and I'd probably agree with you. I don't know if there's a good way to do this. That's how I feel right now. I feel a little bit lost in the weeds of all of this. Let's dig our way out. It is number one that's the Espro. It brewed quickly. There's something about it I don't love. It doesn't have a brewing defect taste to it. And I think if I brewed again with it, I wouldn't have that flavor to it. And in previous brews, that's never really been an issue. This one, number four which would have been the Origami. Interesting. This one, number five. Would have been the Flower Dripper. And I think I said both of those lacked a little intensity, right? They just didn't quite have the same kind of strength and extraction. And I think that's probably the case. This one, number two which would've been the April. I think this was a good brew. It was very nicely extracted. I have no real complaints about this thing here. This one, is the Hsiao coffee. Again, I think it was similar to the other cone-shaped brewers. That slightly lower extraction than some of the sort of flat bedded brewers. But, overall a very enjoyable cup of coffee. It's a good brew. I think, you know, the stars aligned on this one and it brewed very well. It brewed in an identical time to the Espro, you know. So it's interesting that there was a difference in taste. This is why I think it's not down to the brewer necessarily in this particular case. But, I think it probably does benefit from those slightly higher brew temperatures. They've kinda designed here, I think the sort of insulation of walls. I think is super cool. Yeah, pretty good so far. So, let's just have a quick discussion of the data that we've pulled from this quick experiment. And again, the data pool is quite small but still interesting. What we saw was that on average the flat-bottomed brewer had higher extractions than the cone-shaped brewers. Then you could argue we just needed to tweak our grind size here to get matching extractions but that's sort of by the by. What we saw for example here, is that there was a noticeably higher extraction where there was less bypass from the Hsiao brewer. So, you know, that's kinda as expected in a funny sort of way. Why there was a slightly lower extraction with the Flower Brewer over the Origami? I don't know. There might be some variance in me, the human being. Their brew times, their drawdowns were identical. And I really thought they'd have the same extraction and yeah, there might be some human error that are accounting for that small difference. Here, yeah, really interesting. Very similar extractions across the board even though the brew times were quite different. These two brewed identically in terms of time. The April was a little bit slower. I think you could taste that it did have a higher extraction than these two here from that sort of longer contact time. Overall, definitely interesting. You know, these two tasted quite different. I'll be interested on this next round of tasting to sort of see if those differences repeat. But yeah, an interesting little experiment. Now, in order to try and make this testing a little bit fairer, I'm now gonna sort of hand my technique back to the manufacturers in many cases. So I'm gonna brew these all again one more time using the recommended techniques supplied by their websites or videos that they might have online. I'll post links to all the different techniques down below. The only one that didn't have an official technique I think was the Hsiao. But, I'll be interested to see if there are changes, if any of these kind of shift around in their positions from using a more recommended technique from the manufacturer or designer. So all of them brewed. I definitely have some thoughts on that whole process. Time to randomize them so I can go and have a taste and see what's what. You know, I think some of these with these techniques start at the ceiling of where I'd want these coffees to be extracted where things start to get a little too strong and almost overwhelming. But it's nice to have the flexibilities there without sort of falling off into channeling or problematic extractions. Before we have quick summary, let's just look again at the table of data collected this time. And you'll see that, you know, yes, the Espro did indeed brew quickly, much quicker than before and its extraction dropped quite notably so, you know, you'd really wanna push this pretty fine. And that's not a bad thing as long as it's able to extract evenly which I think it is. This one, this brew is interesting in that, we saw an increase in extraction. It's not shocking to me that Patrik Rolf knows how to get the most out of his brewer. His technique, his recommended routine for the April yielded, I think, excellent results. The Stagg I think has had a good day. Its brew method slowed down the brew a little bit and the extraction went up a little bit. And I think that was a good result. I thought their technique worked well. The result was good and it's a bit more work, a bit more effort, but enjoyable. Now the Origami was interesting. We switched from the V60 papers to the Kalita papers and while it didn't impact the brew time, we did see a little bump in extraction which I think is super interesting for potential impact of bypass point of view. But we do have a paper variable now and we don't necessarily understand if you know, we're having this bypass but that paper would have allowed a faster flow. Moving into the Cafec, the Flower. I think the technique is really quite difficult. I felt like it messed it up. To have it happen exactly the way that it does in their video is very difficult. I suspect mostly 'cause I'm using a light roast at a relatively fine grind. I think dark roast, coarser grinds, you know, allow you to achieve that technique a little bit more easily. But, I will say that the results improved. It was a better brew for the technique than previously. The Hsiao was consistent brew to brew. The brew time was a bit slower this time which is interesting. But, the cup was very good each time. An enjoyable brewer. And I have no real complaints about that. So here's the question, is one of these six clearly a better brewer than the others? And I think the answer pretty obviously is no. You know, these are all extremely capable brewers when it comes to brewing coffee. Now, if you think about the amount of data that you'd need to collect, the amount of coffee you'd need to brew, to say with any kind of confidence that this brewer makes coffee tastes like X, Y, or Z, is enormous. You have to do so much work. And I suspect at the end of it, you'd have pretty low confidence in your results. I don't think you can say this brewer makes sweeter coffee, this brewer gives it a cleaner acidity. You know, those kinds of things just aren't really there. They have different approaches to brewing, they have different approaches to bed geometry, to bypass, to materials, all of those kinds of things. But, once you understand how those impact your brew, you can work around them to get great coffee out of them. I don't think that's an issue. Does that mean I recommend them all equally? Well, maybe not, but what I will say is if you own one of these, I wouldn't be selling it to buy another one. You know, if you wanna acquire more and more stuff, and that's a downside of coffee being a hobby, then yeah, maybe pick up one more of these two more of these if you want to and have some fun playing around with it. It does change the way you think about coffee. But, let's start at the beginning. So the Espro Bloom, as I said before, I'm not a fan of its design looking so similar to the December Dripper. I think that's kind of a shame. It is an interesting brewer. And I wouldn't have said it was fussy going into this but you know, today it's been a little bit fussier than I thought to work with. Historically, when I brewed with this, I've enjoyed the coffee and I haven't had any issues. So, you know, make of that what you will. And certainly lots of people who know lots about brewing coffee have had a good time with this thing. The flexibility of being able to use paper or not use paper, something we barely touched on today, is also a pretty cool thing. There's nothing more annoying than running out of filter papers and not being able to brew. But with this, that wouldn't necessarily happen. The April Brewer is clearly built to be an object to be enjoyed as an object. You know, the combination of the cup, the kind of tea set vibes, the look, the feel of the ceramic are very enjoyable. And clearly Patrik Rolf at April knows what he's doing with his brewer. And if you have one of these, I would recommend his routines and his guidance on how you use it, unsurprisingly. He's got a good channel and you should go and check it out. I wish the cup was a little bit bigger. You know, it's quite a limiting size. It looks bigger than it is actually. Sometimes I wanna brew a little bit more coffee for just me. But, it's a great little brewer. The Stagg, I really quite like it. You know it's one that I brewed with the least. I think I would probably just buy the brewer on its own. You know, I think Fellow go for a pretty thorough design approach. And I think the three pieces here are kind of cool. I didn't really use the funnel today. I didn't really need to use it. So, I wouldn't be upset if that wasn't there. But, I understand in some situations that would be useful. The little piece here as a drip cup is a nice piece. The Origami, it just feels like Instagram fodder. It feels like it's a brewer designed to be photographed and it certainly often is. It's not one that I would find myself reaching for all that often. Not because it brews bad coffee, because it doesn't. That's ridiculous thing to say. It brews great coffee. But, with the wooden attachment, it's just a little bit awkward sometimes. And I'd probably just use a V60 instead which I just find it a little bit easier and sort of more practical, you know. If you've got one and you enjoy it, you're right to do so. It's a very capable brewer. I'd probably prefer it with the Kalita papers but that's a pretty small sample size. That's just on today. And similarly the Cafec, it's a very nice brewer. I liked the pattern inside. But, if I had a V60, I'm not sure I could say, yeah, get one of these, it'll change your coffee brewing experience. It will revolutionize it. It'll create something totally new because I really don't think it will. I think it brews very similarly to a V60. If you're kind of curious about what they're doing, maybe try checking out some of the Cafec filter papers. That's kind of interesting of halfway house to sample some of what Cafec is doing that is different to say, Hario V60. Now with the Hsiao brewer, you know this is a much more niche little brewer. It feels quite different. The finish on here, it's a little bit more matte. It's extremely tactile. Like it's a nice object. You know, I like the idea behind the design that encourages the technique without explicitly stating that. And I think without bypass, it does brew tasty coffee. The process of having to fold your filter papers is okay. I would worry about losing this and then being unable to fold them accurately to the right angle. And so, if it becomes successful enough that they get their own papers, that would be kind of cool. But yeah, I enjoyed using it as a brewer. I think it was interesting. I like that people are experimenting and taking fresh approaches. If I had to keep only one or two, probably these two of these ones here, you know. Like I've got a V60. I use V60 all the time. You know, these two would be interesting additions. Maybe the Espro as well. You know, these are closer to what I'm brewing with though this does have a different dynamic to it. You could feel like I'm not really giving you an answer but I do wanna get away from the idea that there is a singular best in these things. There's gonna be one that fits your budget, fits your lifestyle, fits the design of your kitchen, fits how you wanna make coffee in the morning. Now, as always with things I review, I don't get to keep them. These go to my Patreon backers who support this channel, allow me to go out, back these things on Kickstarter, buy these things online and review them as honestly as I can. But now I wanna hear from you down in the comments below.", "videoID": "RP1BH1AiwoQ"}, {"title": "The Ultimate Pumpkin Spice Latte", "text": "Summer is gone, the nights are closing in, the leaves are turning. It must be time for the Pumpkin Spice Latte. And it is. And today we're gonna make the ultimate Pumpkin Spice Latte, but to start with, I'm gonna benchmark. I'm gonna get to Starbucks and buy one. Success. So we're down at Tower Bridge because this is where the nicest Starbucks in London is and it seemed the best place to go and get one of these. And let's have a taste. Ginger, a little bit of cinnamon. The other spices are way down, very sweet, incredibly sweet. Technically some pumpkin is in the Pumpkin Spice Latte for reasons I don't truly understand. So now I wanna make my own ultimate version of this. If we're gonna put pumpkin in this, well we should work out which pumpkin we should put in it. So we're gonna go to Borough Market, try and buy a bunch of pumpkins and then head back to the studio and start cooking it up. Let's start with pumpkins. And I know that's kind of weird because I'm pretty sure Pumpkin Spice Lattes started without pumpkin in them. They were just like a Cafe Latte with the spice mix that people use for Pumpkin Pie. And that's a classic spice mix that we're gonna touch on in a minute. But at some point people started putting pumpkin in the drink. Stop, stop, stop, stop stop. What I was doing I think was all wrong. Let me explain. The original idea of the video was to kind of make a sauce that tasted just like Pumpkin Pie. This is really popular approach online. And ultimately, I don't think that's the right approach for me. You know, I wanted to find the perfect pumpkin taste a bunch of different ones, use that to create a Pumpkin Puree, but by the time I was sieving out my blended Pumpkin Puree, I just wasn't happy. I felt like I was complicating other people's work and there had to be a different, a fresh approach. Now this whole thing had started when I'd gone to the website, I looked at Starbucks' ingredients for their Pumpkin Spice Sauce. And you can see things like Pumpkin Puree or condensed milk in there, but I was haunted by this. A little sample of the syrup that they had given me in Starbucks. This, aside from being a tremendous color, well, it doesn't have Pumpkin Puree in it. It's a clear sauce. It doesn't have condensed milk in it. And then I realized this year, they're launching in the UK a kind of vegan version because this, if you taste it, it's really just like a cinnamon syrup with a hint of a few other spices. But I liked the idea of something that worked for everybody, something that didn't exclude people who don't wanna drink dairy. Now, I do kind of love the color of that, but I also love the color of pumpkins. And so what I wanna do is capture some of that color of pumpkin, but I don't want solids. I don't want any pureed pumpkin. I don't wanna have to cook bits of pumpkin. None of that is interesting to me. So what we're gonna do from the beginning is juice a pumpkin. What's gonna make this recipe notable, I think, is the spice selection. So pumpkin spice mix is a is a pre sort of made spice mixture you can buy much of the U.S. that contains five different spices. We're gonna go deep on saucing spices in just a second, but to start with, I'm gonna take one of these pumpkin's, I'm gonna juice it down, and that will be the beginning of this whole thing. Now when you're using a pumpkin, know that you'll get about 50% yield. If you juice 100 grams of pumpkin flesh, you'll get about 50 grams, a little bit less, of juice out of that. So when you look at the recipe and decide how much of this mixture you wanna make, that will decide how much pumpkin you wanna start with. You don't need one this big. Go for something much smaller, like a little Kabocha if you like the flavor of those a little bit more. This Jar-head here is very big. I'm not gonna use all of it by any stretch. I'm gonna start with about 500 grams of pumpkin flesh to give me about 250 grams of pumpkin juice. I'm someone who thinks about things through a lens of coffee, so the idea that different spices should taste different if they're grown in different places, well, that makes total sense to me. So I went out and I bought a ton of different spices from different origins, with as much traceability as I could find. At the end of this there'll be links to these particular spaces down below. So the biggest component of a pumpkin spice blend traditionally is cinnamon. Now you can go two ways with cinnamon. You can go down the traditional cinnamon quills route, or you can use what's called cassia bark. Now I wanna use both because they have two quite different characteristics of cinnamon. The cassia bark, in this case it's from Vietnam. Smells amazing. It's that kind of candy cinnamon. It's that jelly beans cinnamon that very bright, lively, hot, spicy cinnamon, almost cartoonish. You know what I mean? It's almost artificial but so, so incredibly good. But it needs some balance. And what I loved about these, these are Sri Lankan cinnamon quills is that you've got that warmer slight earthier, slightly rounder experience of cinnamon. They're absolutely cinnamon but it's a totally different thing. And by combining equal parts of these two, we get this broad spectrum of cinnamon's taste and aromatics that is incredibly enjoyable. So second ingredient that's really important is ginger. This is something I tasted quite strong in the Starbucks drink. Though I might've just put it there with my mind. It's hard to find traceable ginger powder. A lot of what I tested came from India and that was the kind of heavier, almost earthier ginger. This from China, I really liked. It was a bit more aromatic, kind of zestier, fresher, brighter, still a good bit of heat from that too, really very enjoyable. So that's gonna be a secondary component. Clove is a difficult one for me. I had an accident sort of with a kind of super critical extract of cloves which scarred me for life. I find it quite challenging smell and taste and ultimately cloves easily overwhelm everything. So we're gonna use this extremely sparingly. These ones are Sri Lankan. A lot of it comes from Indonesia too but I just slightly preferred these for Sri Lankan ones. All of that pungency that you want from clove but almost a little bit sweeter, which was very nice. Now, nutmeg is one of my favorite spices just 'cause it looks beautiful when you cut open into it. This one is from a French company called  I think it's from Grenada and it smells amazing. Now this in particular, you need to grind fresh or grade fresh in many dishes because it fades very fast, but we're coffee people. We used to grinding stuff to order. The last spice in the mix is allspice. I don't know a ton about it. I struggled to find much variety of it and the ones that I did get really there wasn't a huge variation so don't stress out too much hunting for the perfect allspice with my experience so far. Now, like I said, we're coffee people, we think like coffee people. What's gonna make this whole recipe much more interesting is that we're gonna grind our spice mix to order. Now, maybe like me, you've got an old blade grinder lying around and that is completely perfect. This is just the cheap Krups one. I think it was like 15 Pounds. It's what we're gonna be using today. Everything in the grinder, grind until it's a nice, fine powder. May take a little while and give it a shake now again as you go. Onto the next stage where we're gonna make the spiced syrup. We're gonna take a weight of pumpkin juice here and we're gonna add an equal amount of water. Use the same jug, it's okay. Now the ultimate syrup, the way move forward, is gonna be more akin to a two to one syrup. Where it's two parts sugar, one part of water. But to start with, we're gonna make it a one to one. So here I've got about 450 grams of liquid. So I'm gonna take 450 grams of Demerara sugar. You can get something a little Browner if you want to but I figured that's just Brown enough to be that little bit of softening that we like and then we gonna cook it to reduce it until it's closer to a two to one syrup. That cooking process will transform the flavor of the pumpkin juice from being that kind of very fresh but slightly vegetal-green kind of flavor into more of a cooked flavor. And it will be pretty muted as flavor goes by the time it's all kind of finished and we're gonna add to this about 20 grams of the spice mixture and we're gonna cook it all down together. So onto the heat and give it a little whisk to stir get that sugar dissolved. So we cooked stuff down now but the important phase we need is a bit of separation. I don't want any bits in my syrup. Now I'm a bit unusual and I have a very fine drum sieve lying around 'cause I'm a bit weird. So I'm gonna pass it through this. It's about 19 microns, so extremely fine but it would be perfectly acceptable to use something like a cheesecloth or Muslim. And then when strained and happy you can transfer to your squeeze bottle. We're good to go. Let's make a drink. Now, It's not entirely up to me to tell you how much syrup to use. I don't like things too much on the sweet side. So in what is an eight ounces drink, I'm gonna max out. For me at about 15 grams syrup, but I'm just gonna mix into my espresso before adding that a steamed milk. At this point you could be using a plant milk of some sort. It depends what you like, be it old or anything else. Having a lovely very simple little experience. For some people maybe too sweet, for some people not sweet enough. The spice level is very pleasant. It's very balanced. Even with dairy in this particular drink, you can get the extra layers of complexity of kind of flavor or at least that come with some really great spices sourced from different parts of the world. I would absolutely beg you go, go and source some interesting spices from different places. Taste the difference, it's eyeopening. What I didn't do yet was actually do a direct comparison between what I have here and what I have here. That with a little taste of the Starbucks syrup. What a color? Kind of a very simplistic cinnamon, very big whack of cloves, which I've just not chasing personally. Interesting acidity there. I suspect that might be part of it's preservative, you know, component there. Let's compare it to something a little bit more traceable, homemade, aromatic. Worlds apart. So much complexity, warmth, depth, breadth of flavor. Room for each of those spices to come out. That is very nice. That is really nice. 'Cause this got good ingredients. It's the lesson that coffee, I hope, teaches all of us. Which is good ingredients are kind of the key to everything else. We can go further. We should go for like a more complete build of this thing. Now, if you're curious about any of this stuff going on here there's links to it down below, there's a recipe linked on a website. A website that I built with this video sponsor. Which is Squarespace. When it's time for me to build a website, I always turn to Squarespace. It doesn't matter if it's a website for me in a portfolio of the work that I do or if it's for an event. Like the world's largest coffee tasting or a showcase for my book, \"The World Atlas of Coffee\". For me it's so easy that I can start with one of their templates and very quickly transform it into being something that is truly my own. My words, my images, my style. Very quickly you can go from idea to a beautiful representation of who you are or what you do online. And more than that, once that website's up, you know, it's gonna look good across any and all browsers and there's nothing to patch, upgrade or install. There's no maintenance to really worry about, but there is 24 seven email support. I would say, don't take my word for it. Go sign up for trial down below, build something. And when you're ready to launch use code JAMESHOFFMANN for 10% of any website or any domain. Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So the last part of this drink built, to make it the ultimate Pumpkin Spice Latte is gonna be some Whipped Cream. Now, maybe like me, you're kind of put off by that because at this point we've got quite a lot of milk of some sort, plus sugar, plus spices. The coffee's kind of getting obliterated by all the stuff going on here and having a Whipped Cream on top. Well actually that's only gonna make it worse. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna do a special coffee-infused Whipped Cream to go on top to make it extremely delicious. Just think about this as a Pumpkin Spice Latte topped with a little almost coffee ice cream. Start with, we're just gonna use 10 fluid ounces or 280ml more sensibly of double cream. To that we're gonna add the seeds and half of vanilla bean pod. You could use paste if you wanted to, but if you have a vanilla bean pod lying around it's very useful. Pour it in two. And then for Whipped Cream, I generally like about 5% weight of sugar. Just white sugar is totally fine. And then we're gonna add 10 grams of pretty costly ground coffee. We want a nice and easy to stray out later so don't bother going too fine, it's gonna give up its flavor pretty quickly and will be delicious. Throw that on the heat gently just to warm it up just a little bit, to get some infusion going on. So once it's done, you're just gonna strain it out. It's taken on some very nice color. This is gonna go into your Whipping Siphon. I'm gonna chill it down, charge it, and then we're ready for the final drink build. For estimate my milk would just get our syrup in. Now when it comes to steaming the milk, if you're gonna add whipped cream know that your foam is still gonna be light than the Whipped Cream. So the Whipped Cream was sink into the foam. So you want a little foam as you can get away with just like a nice silky texture that you might use for a flat white or a latte. We don't need to worry about latte out either. And then a little dusting of our spices. And what we have here is an oozing and decadent treat. There is a lovely little hit of coffee up front from that cold-sweet vanillary coffee cream. Then that kind of warm spiciness underneath. It's sweet, but it's not overwhelming. It's autumnal. It's what you want Autumn to taste like. A little bit messy but it's just delicious. There it is, the ultimate Pumpkin Spice Latte. I am very pleased with the result. If you didn't wanna do the Whipped Cream but a vegan version using say coconut, do the same thing in terms of the amount of coffee and the amount of sugar and the amount of vanilla bean going in there. And you'll have a very similar result. Did it taste of pumpkin? No, not really. Did that count as one of my five a day still? Probably not also. Was it delicious, was it fun to make, was it interesting, was it beautiful? I think so. And I think you should give it a go too. I think this is so interesting to me to look at other ingredients through the lens of coffee. Right? To think about spices like you think about coffee and in doing so I learned a ton. I discovered what I like. I discovered a whole new range of flavors and I made an end result that while many considered trashy I think shows a kind of taste of place. It shows providence, it shows some transparency in its flavors. And I think that's kind of cool as well as just being incredibly delicious. But let me know your thoughts. Let me know if you give this a try. Let me know what you think.", "videoID": "3hLyDVgkUJY"}, {"title": "The AeroPress (Episode #1)", "text": "Welcome to this video all about the AeroPress. Now on this channel, we run a little series. It's called the Classics of Coffee. We look at iconic coffee brewers, their invention, their history, how they came to be so popular worldwide. This is an unusual inclusion. It's relatively young compared to most of the other subjects we might look at. It was invented and released only in 2005, but it has come to be a global phenomenon. It's everywhere around the world. It's hugely successful. And we should look at why. Now it was invented, as I said, in 2005, by Alan Adler. Now, Alan is a serial inventor and his passion really started with sailboats. He loved sailboats, he wanted to design them, and so he needed to understand aerodynamics. That led him all the way to inventing the Aerobie Flying Ring. Released in 1985, it's still a classic today. I still have one at home, I still throw them around now and again. And within a year of its release, it had made the Guinness Book of World Records for the furthest object thrown by human hand, at that time about 320 meters, has since gone to around 400 meters, which is a very long way to throw something. Now the AeroPress came much later. It came out of Alan's frustration with not being able to get a good single cup out of a small domestic coffee brewer. You know, those things were typically designed to brew maybe six to eight cups, and no matter what he did, he could not get a single serving out of one that tasted good. That frustration led to the invention of this, the AeroPress. As I said, it was released in 2005, but it didn't really find popularity until more like 2008. And I think some context is really, really important here from the wider specialty coffee industry. There had been a company who'd created a machine called the Clover. Now this was very influential, 2006, 2007 because it encouraged cafes to brew different coffees by the cup. And so the coffee industry got excited about what seems normal now. Like, offering a cup of this coffee from Brazil or a cup of this coffee from Columbia, side-by-side on a menu. Before this, batch brew had really ruled and that was the kind of choice, you might have one or two things. But now cafes around the world were embracing brewing by the cup and offering a diverse menu of coffees. In 2008, Clover was sold to Starbucks. And while the industry as a whole might've felt a little betrayed by the sale, they had found a love for single-cup brewing, but no longer could use this machine. And so they began to look for other single-cup brewers. Around this time you see things like the Hario V60 explode in popularity, as well as the AeroPress. What I think makes the AeroPress interesting and particularly desirable to home brewers is that it's kind of the antithesis of a pour-over. There's not much in the way of special techniques, you don't need a fancy kettle, you don't need to pour in a certain way, it's relatively simple and I think people really loved that. Now I've spent a good amount of time on internet coffee forums over the last 20 years, and one thing has always stuck out about the AeroPress, it has this super high level of satisfaction. Once people use it a couple of times, they kinda fall in love with this process, especially if it's their first single-cup coffee brewer. That, I find hugely compelling and really quite interesting. Now, if you're unfamiliar with the AeroPress, what I'll do to kinda walk you through what you get in the box, how it all works, is brew coffee exactly like they tell you to in the instructions that come with it. \"Push plunger out of chamber. Put filter in filter cap. Twist filter cap onto chamber. Stand chamber on sturdy mug and put one rounded scoop of fine drip grind coffee in chamber. Shake to level coffee. Add water up to the number one on the chamber. 80 degrees C water for hot brewing. Stir for about 10 seconds for hot brewing. Insert plunger and press gently, pausing when you feel resistance, until plunger reaches grounds. Remove filter cap, push plunger to eject used coffee and rinse seal.\" Now you've probably noticed that the brew temperature used for this is different from what most people recommend. 80 degrees C is a lot lower than I would typically say to brew your coffee. Alan, the inventor, really truly believes this is key to getting great coffee out of the AeroPress and he has fought tooth and nail for that since its inception. I think it's interesting, but I really don't believe it's an essential part of getting great coffee out of this thing. Now, according to the instructions, you can drink this as is, espresso style, though there's a lot of debate about whether this can really be called espresso style. It's a small, strong coffee, but we'll not go down that rabbit hole right now. You could obviously dilute this, which is what I'm gonna do, to make an Americano-style drink, or more like a drip-strength drink. Let me do that. Now one thing I love about the instructions is that nowhere in it does actually mention this piece, which actually has two uses. One, you can use it as a funnel to load coffee into the top of the AeroPress, or two, you can actually brew your AeroPress stood on it, and press into a smaller cup if the base of this is too wide. You'd think it would be worth mentioning, but it's not in your instructions. Now, as we're talking about parts and that kind of stuff, we should probably talk about the composition of an AeroPress. Now the initial runs, I think for the first four years or so, were made from polycarbonate. And that became kind of a no-no in the 2000s as people became more concerned about BPA. And so I think in August, 2009, production switched to a copolyester. Now, AeroPress do say that they tested their early models and found no leaching of BPA into coffee, but I think people were concerned and they had really no choice, but to switch. The design on the front here has changed a little bit over the years. The first design I think is kind of weird, but beautiful, of the very first run where there's different sized bubbles for the one, two, three, and four cup. I still don't really understand what they mean, but I find that design completely charming. It's since shifted to the one, two, three, four cup circles to give you an idea of roughly how much water to put in. But the sort of roughness of this, again, is part of its charm. There's no need for extreme precision in this brewer, not in how it's presented to you. That's kind of interesting. The modern version, the latest version, all of this stuff is now in red. There was a version where it was in gold before. There's a version where it was in blue to start with. If you've got one from the initial run, hold onto it. I think it's a kind of collector's item now. I used to have one. I have since lost it. And that hurts me inside. Now, this cup of coffee here is not how I would choose to brew with an AeroPress. But I think what has made it so successful, what has sold millions of units around the world, is that you can brew with this thing a host of different ways, a myriad of different ways. There's almost infinite possibilities. And I think that's very clever. When Alan set out to make this, he was trying to make a pour-over that you could accelerate by pressing the water through and skip the drawdown phase. In doing so, he created a brewer that is a kind of hybrid of immersion and percolation. A brewer that lets you take all of the individual components of a brewing recipe, dose, amount of water, brew temperature, brew time, agitation, even pressure and play with them individually. That, I think, has made it so incredibly compelling to people around the world. Plus, it's relatively cheap, it's lightweight, it's almost impossible to break, it travels very easily. It's a compelling offering all around. But, while I think it's easy to brew good coffee with, I think it's actually a very difficult brewer to truly master. But that brings me in an unexpected way to the World AeroPress Championships. Because the idea that you could have a global competition running year after year dedicated to just one single-cup, $30 brewer, is kinda mind-bending. It started in 2008 in a little room off to the side of Tim Wendelboe's cafe, and three people, all from Norway, took part. And it was called the World AeroPress Championship in part to mock Americans for having the World Series, when really it's just their baseball league. And they felt, well, why can't we call it the World AeroPress Championships? This was a competition where all you had to do was brew a cup of coffee that tasted good with the AeroPress. That was it. There was no performance. There was no expense in preparing for these competitions. You turned up and you brewed, and the best cup won. And people found this, I think, a very compelling kind of antithesis to the mainstream coffee competitions that had become big, serious things that required money, time, and effort to enter. The AeroPress competition was kind of the opposite of that. And people loved it. But since, it has grown into a global event where you have dozens of national competitions feeding into this one big world finals, and often the national competitions will have regional arounds. Thousands of people enter the AeroPress competition every year. And I think that's amazing. But the whole competition is dependent on the idea that mastery, true mastery, of this brewer is actually very difficult. Now, I've judged in nationals as well as the world finals, and one thing has really stuck with me. You would get a brew in one round that would blow everything else away, but that same competitor one round later would produce something kind of average. It was pretty rare that you could track the winning brew all the way through its rounds. It felt a little bit more random than you would expect it to. It seemed really quite difficult to really, really replicate the same brew over and over and over again. Because you have this myriad of brewing techniques, because there are so many different ways to brew with this, that has made me reluctant, up until this point, really to talk about about an ultimate AeroPress technique. But that's gonna change. But the way I'm gonna do it is a little bit different. I'm not gonna tell you what it is and this video, because we've got a lot more to talk about. The next video in this series, we're gonna be diving much deeper into what's happening inside an AeroPress. Because you've got all these different components of pressure, of brew time, of agitation, well, how much do we really understand them? And if we can break them apart, not only can I tell you my preferred way of brewing with an AeroPress, but you can take those tools and build your preferred way of brewing with an AeroPress. So that's the next video in this series. Now, before we have a little ad for this video's sponsor, which is Squarespace, I do wanna say, that to celebrate this, to celebrate finally making a video about the AeroPress, I'm gonna give 25 AeroPresses away.

How have they improved on it, adapted it, improvised on it? Have they made a better Moka pot? As we've gone through this series, lots of you have left comments saying, \"Oh, you have to look at this pot or that pot.\" And so I grabbed a few of them and we're gonna take a look. Gonna be a little bit of fun and I hope kind of interesting too. Let me talk you through, briefly, what we have on the menu for today. First up, probably the most highly requested is the Bialetti Brikka. A little pressure valve inside that one, which is interesting. Next up, will be the Mukka, it makes milk drinks. We're gonna make a cappuccino all in one pot. I don't know what I expect. I've got the Cuor di Moka, super interesting little pot. They don't make this anymore, and so you can only really get them second-hand, difficult to track down, but lots of you asked about this. So, we're gonna brew some coffee with that. And then at the end, you're not gonna want to miss this one, is the Kamira, an interesting little adaptation of the Moka pot idea. Let's brew some coffee. So first up is the Brikka, probably the most requested thing to sort of talk about. And what makes it different from a normal Moka pot is actually in the top part here. If you get the gasket out, and then your filter, it just drops out. You can sort of see in here something's going on. So actually it turns out if you take the top apart, the interesting part is inside. There's a little rubber valve and this is it. This little mouth is the only thing in the way of the coffee. So, it'll prevent the liquid flowing through until it reaches a certain pressure, and then it will be forced open. You should get a foamier cup by creating some additional pressure with this thing. Let's see if that's true, let's get it onto the heat. This does have a little cutout, so you can sort of see what's going on with your brew. Now, the interesting thing to me, actually, let me get the cut away Moka pot to explain this. So the interesting thing about this is if you restrict the coffee flow here, water's gonna boil down here, it's gonna push the water up through the coffee, it'll go through the filter up to here and then get stuck. And so some water will have passed through the coffee. Some water will be sort of in the coffee and you'll reach a point of, sort of static flow. It won't move anymore. It'll just sort of stall there while it builds pressure as the water gets hotter and hotter and hotter in the base. Now, you might get some boiling liquid, which will create foam, a less stable foam than CO2 coming out of solution as is traditional with crema. But I don't really know if this is gonna make a better tasting brew or just a foamier brew. We'll find out. All right, buddy. Definitely getting foam. Just got a really, really hot pot there. You're just coming off the heat. You are coming off the heat. We are angry. I'm taking you to the sink to run under a cold tap. This has just come straight back. This is 100% Arabica, specialty coffee. Not super dark roasted, so it's not gonna be that thick and foamy. I do wonder if it would be happier with something designed to have a thicker layer of crema, a darker roast, or maybe something with robusta in there. I don't know, but we have retained no foam. But how is the drink? Ooh, that's a lot. That's like a lot, a lot of attack. I feel like this roast is probably too light for this kind of a pot. It's quite a lot of acidity, a lot of concentration. Are you still- Do you wanna be quiet? I'll see if a cold tap helps shut you up. Anyway, I would say this brew is super intense. It's too acidic, it's not actually super bitter, tastes pretty extracted, but just like a lot. The question I have is, what's actually happening in here? Now, I think, hopefully, that the base from the Franken Moka, that has all the pressure information on it, I think it will fit the threading of the top part of this with the valve in it. So, if we run the Franken Moka base, we should be able to see at what pressure the valve opens in the Brikka. Now we're not gonna measure temperature, just pressure today, hopefully. So this is tracking the pressure inside the unit, and this transducer connected to this thing here. So we can see right now we're at .03 bars of pressure. 0.2 now. In a lot of testing we did, coffee began to flow through a normal Moka at about 0.3 bars. Changed the coffee out for something more traditional. I'm not gonna say what. Oh, that was it, a bar, a bar! But interestingly, we're still climbing in terms of pressure, rapidly. Cut the heat, we're at 1.5 bars. Oh, that's foaming up. All right, all right, sh sh sh. Come with me, come with me, sh sh sh sh. It's very angry!  It's coming out the top! Aah! It would have been smart to remember that I used a larger base than the top section. And so, unsurprisingly, I ran out of room in the top part and that was terrifying, to be honest. So, that happened. Where did we peak? 1.79 bars. Oh yes, that is more traditional. Oh, that is a strong cup of coffee. That feels intense. Not my favorite. Darker roasted, for sure. Much more intensity. The top chamber gets very foamy in this situation, but you don't get any foam in the cup, it just sort of sits back from the edge when you pour, so no foam for you. So the Brikka was surprising to me. I thought you'd see a more obvious release of pressure when the valve opened at about a bar, but you didn't really see that. And it seemed to be just above one bar of pressure, which seems notable, but not shocking. Like I said, in most brews it would be about 0.3, to start getting liquid was all you needed. So holding it back to one, it just seemed really angry, hotter, certainly that a normal pot. Yeah, you get a lot of foam. I'm not sure that's to the massive benefit of the cup. I think with more traditional roasts, it might be okay, but I would definitely want to stop this as soon as it got to sputtering, because it was getting really angry, and cooling it down there will definitely reduce the bitterness but, interesting as an innovation, but I don't think transformative in the cup. So next step is the Bialetti Mukka. The one that's supposed to do a cappuccino or caff\u00e8 latte, all in one, all in one. Now, if you look at the front of the box, this promise looks quite appetizing. Nice layer of foam, bit of a kind of latte macchiato vibes. But if you open the box up, the instructions offer something else. I don't know, it's kind of weird. This has the click clack, as they call it, which is like a bayonet style, portafilter style locking thing, so no threading. Now, look at this, look at this, why is this not normal? 'Cause if there's one thing about the Moka pot, that's just awful, it's getting this out, especially after you use it. So like the little thing, oh, it's all wonky. Ooh, it's squishy. Why is it squishy? You're supposed to fill it to that level. And then when you put it in, it'd be compressed. So it comes with a nice guide that tells you how much water to put in, depending if you're using gas or an electric plate, which I think is super interesting. So I'm gonna use the gas water fill level. I'm gonna go cold water. That is not much. I guess we're trying to make a lot of steam. So, coffee, let's go traditional again. So there it is. I guess we put it in, we lock it together. Click clack. And it says, press for cappuccino. 'Cause it's got like two positions up and a down. Gonna go down and then we'll put it on the flame directly. It does say you want the flame to be no wider than the base, but it's a pretty wide base. So, let's see what happens. Oh, milk, milk. So, we're gonna put milk or a milk alternative in until the fill level inside here. And it's gonna do the steamy foamy thing, I think. Now, I can't see what's happening. I've never used this before. I've got my heat source, right? It says, seven, step seven, your drink is ready. When you hear the characteristic puff of the Mukka express,  wait for the coffee to come up, wait a few seconds and then switch the heat off and remove the product. Enjoy your cappuccino. I mean, that's gonna be making a lot of air pressure. Like there's a lot of air in that chamber to expand, that would push liquid up at a relatively low temperature. But I guess you've got such a wide base and a thin layer of water. That's gonna get hot quickly too. Really interesting. That was the characteristic puff, I suppose. Ooh, I guess we'll have a little swirl. I'm presuming there's coffee in here too. Oh, yeah. Do I need to lift the lid to get foam? Give me that foam. I think I removed the product too soon because that's like 30 degrees Celsius. I think it needs more time to be angry. This is probably really stupid, but they sounded like there was a bit of an explosion inside the Mukka, but the lid is not dirty, which says to me that we could totally film it lid open. So let's film it lid open. Please don't complain that I haven't ironed my lab coat. Okay. Safety first, kids. So looks like a little coffee flavour is coming up. I'm just getting nervous now. Oh. Oh, yeah! Look at that! I should stop there. No, it shouldn't because it was cold last time. Give me more. That is unexpected and frankly, fantastic. All right, let's get a - let's have a taste! A classic, 1990s steam milk technique. Still not that hot. I would probably recommend another way of heating and steaming or foaming milk, to be honest. I think a microwave and like a French press, like up-down technique is probably superior to this, if I'm honest. If you've got one of the little aerolatte type whisks, something like those would be better than this. It's fun, it's just not very good at steaming milk in an interesting way that makes it hot enough. And that's all I have to say about that. So next up, this one, I'm kind of excited about this one. They don't make them new anymore it seems, but you can still pick them up on eBay and places like that. It's called the Cuor di Moka, the heart of the Moka, I guess. There's a little heart symbol here. And then inside this, and it is used, so don't judge me, I didn't do this to it. Inside, you can see there's a little heart here attached to a float. So this, depending on the liquid level in the top chamber would move up. And that's the innovation here. Essentially, rather than you having to go and run it under the tap or do other stuff like that, this will just cut off the whole brewer at a certain level. You would never over extract it, I guess. And so you just get the heart, I guess. Was that what they mean? Like almost like the heart of an artichoke, like the heart of the Moka. Anyway, what we'll do is we'll brew with this. Now this was a collaboration, I understand, between a Bialetti and Illy Caff\u00e8. And so, oops. And so it only seems right to brew an appropriate coffee. Whole bean, whole bean, 'cause you know, we're gonna do this right. Oh yes, that gas flush goodness. Let's grind some Illy. This is a one cup, I'm gonna get about six grams of coffee in here, I reckon. We're gonna get about 60 grams of liquid in this in the base, but how much will we get out before the Cuor di Moka says no? So they said a medium flame. A medium flame it will be. So we'll see what happens. It does also say that if you leave it to heat, then the valve is probably gonna open, and be careful and don't burn yourself. Because once you trap it, once you close the top section, if you keep increasing the pressure through temperature, the only way to get steam or pressure out is through the emergency relief valve, through the pressure relief valve. Oh, we have coffee. Curious how much liquid we'll get before the float lifts. Is that it? It's very subtle. I thought there'd be more of an obvious kind of lift, but no, it's pretty minimal. All right, I'm curious how much liquid we actually got out of this thing. So let's weigh and find out. 28 grams. All right, cheers. It's a pretty good brew. That coffee is roasted in such a way that it's pretty soluble, cutting it off at that point hasn't led to massive under extraction, it's quite a nicely textured cup. This definitely would not work well for lighter roasts. There's just no way I think you'd get enough water through to properly extract the coffee unless we're using a super fine grind, and I think you'd have some trouble there. But overall, I'm kind of pleasantly surprised by it. I think for that style of coffee, it works really well. I like the automation of it. I like not having to pay attention or worry too much. But, I don't think it's a better brewer, because I think losing that flexibility isn't a good thing. I can brew exactly this with a regular Moka if I stop it at the right time. So I can brew that kind of shorter ristretto style Moka, I guess if I want to, or I can brew something a little bit longer and more extracted if I want to. So for me, it's an interesting little idea. It's an interesting little innovation, but I don't think it's made a better brewer. If you just like this style of coffee, more developed roasts, shorter cups, maybe track one down. But I would say it's probably not worth swapping out a Moka you already own for one of these. Now, before we get into this thing, which might be my favorite, in a way, of today's brewers.

Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So this is the Kamira. I've had this in the studio a couple of years and I just haven't had a chance to get it out and get it on video. So I'm excited that it has made it into today's lineup. This came to my attention via one of it's promotional videos, which is interesting. And honestly, I didn't know coffee could, or was supposed to look like that. But they established an early coffee and hair connection, which I fully endorse. Nothing about this makes a ton of sense, but I love it, nonetheless. Let's walk through how you brew with this thing 'cause it's kind of fun. You've got your reservoir fill here. So this is a little tank, you fill this up and then in order to get the water into the brewer, you have to open this valve. This then allows water down into the bottom section, which is the boiler, basically. You then close your valve, so that when you start to heat it, obviously no pressure can escape here, which is gonna drive hot water up this tube, round and down, and then into the little kind of portafilter thing here. This, well, this is just kind of weird. You fill this with coffee, even though the bottom of it has this little tiny filtration section in it that I don't necessarily understand or think is that good of a thing that leads to a little tiny spout out of which you are very strange frothy coffee comes. Let me just make some coffee, it'll make more sense. I will say that I've had some issues with it because when I put water in here and open the valve, it's like an airlock has happened, and until I kind of wobble and shake the brewer, I can't get the water to go down into the boiler. Someone in the comments will tell me why that is and why I can't get it right. But I honestly don't know right now. It just won't drain. All right, I think we've got the water in. In what is, I think easily, the most gloriously insane decision in this brewer, this goes on the heat. And actually you're gonna put your cup on top of the boiler. The thing that's gonna get to like 120 degrees Celsius, you're gonna put your cup there. So, I guess preheated cups is a win. So for coffee, we're gonna go something very traditional, something with some robusta in it, honestly, because I want to see what happens to the kind of crema, the foam. This thing promises a very specific texture, so I have some Lavazza Crema e Gusto, um 'cream and taste'. I'm not trying to be disparaging about Lavazza, I'm not saying this is right or wrong, I just wanted something more traditional to go with this, honestly. So we fill a portafilter, but we don't tamp. Are we in?  Look at this. Look at that. I should probably stop it brewing, but I just... I'm looking at it... Look at that! Look at it go, oh, it's the best. Discharge pressure. I love it, I love it, I love it. Look at that. That is the weirdest foam. That's so good. Honestly, it's not a bad brewer. This is a darker roasted coffee relatively high in robusta It doesn't taste over extracted necessarily. It's it's pretty harsh still. I think it has a very traditional, classic kind of darker roasted, high robusta bitterness that's there. It's not super hot, actually. This seems to brew that a little bit cooler, which is interesting. But the foam, how good is that? I honestly think it's kind of fun. I don't think it's a very practical brewer at all. And I think having the cup on the hot thing is not good, but I think it brews in this really bizarre but interesting way. And the whole foam thing? Delightful. Bizarre, delightful. Would probably stick with a Moka pot, but I've never had a brewer that made me coffee that looked like that. So make of that what you will. I think it's fun. I think it's fun, it's okay to have fun. And this is fun, cheers. This, I don't keep. None of the brewers today I'm gonna keep. In fact, none of the Mokas that we've used in this whole series, am I gonna keep. Just one exception, I keep a Franken Moka for myself. One is being raffled. This may still be time to enter that and pick up a ticket for that raffle and win one of those things. But the rest will be going to my Patreon supporters. They give me the budget to go out and buy these things, test them, learn this stuff and share it with you. So thank you to them. But now I'd like to hear from you, down in the comments below. What brewers should we have included? Now I didn't include the kind of competition filter that I think you can get for Moka pots. I thought that's kind of different to kind of Moka derived brewers. That's like an add on for Moka brewing.", "videoID": "uwMPGEo4zCs"}, {"title": "Review\uff1a The Niche Zero Grinder", "text": "Today we're gonna review this, the Niche Zero Grinder. It's a grinder that has confounded my expectations in a good way. So let me tell you about where this came from. This I first saw on Indiegogo, and for that reason, ignored, because it was from an unknown manufacturer, it was crowdfunding, and it made some big promises about fixing problems with coffee. And those three things together are a giant red flag. And I will broadly ignore anything that has those three things, on crowdfunding or anywhere else., because most of the time it's just not gonna happen. There's been a lot of companies turned up, new to manufacturing, gonna do something big and bold and I'm gonna kick start it, or put it in Indiegogo, and you get nothing. You get burned usually. So, I ignored it, to my detriment to be honest, because for every rule that I have there's probably and exception, and this might just be one. So I wasn't gonna look at it, I wasn't gonna review it, but then they got in touch and said did I want to, you know, to try, and I said no, I have a Patreon. Which is amazing, so thank you to Patreon supporters. Which means that I can buy the equipment that I review so it's an independent review. And I explained this to them and we agreed that I would buy a unit, and they gave me a small discount for which I am very grateful, but I still bought this and this will be given away, sort of, to a Patreon backer. So this thing's \u00a3500 in the UK, and ships, I think, all over the world, they do a one ten and a two twenty volt model. And, for the money I have to say compared to other grinders at the same price point, it's pretty small, it's pretty light, it's about five kilos, but it feels very well built, it feels very nicely put together, it feels really solid, it sounds solid when it grinds, it just feels good. Now, design wise, I can't tell you how to feel about how something looks, it looks like a kitchen appliance, it has a little bit of coffee grinder in there and a little bit of juicer in there too. It comes, I think in jus two colors, a white and a black. But I like how it looks. The detail around the wood is nice, it's built by someone who's built things before, and this I think is really key, it might be a new company, but Martin the guy behind it, has spent a long time designing and building products, and I think that really really shows. So, it's called the Niche Zero because it's big promise is zero retention which we'll get into also in a little bit. Now, the design I think is interesting because design is about picking problems and finding solutions for those problems. There's whole suite of problems you can look at with a coffee grinder and I think the selection that they've chosen to fix or attempted to fix here, is a very smart selection. For example, this is not a grinder trying to fix dosing for you. You are gonna weigh your coffee beans, put them in, grind them, right. The grinder is gonna do no work to help you dose your coffee, whatsoever. That's not a problem it's interested in solving. Here, wat they're really trying to do, is get out everything that you put in. The whole point of zero retention is that there's nothing left inside. Which is mostly true. It's not entirely true, there's always gonna be a little bit of retention and even if you put eighteen and a half in and get eighteen and a half out, that doesn't mean zero retention, there probably was some coffee retained and exchanged and replaced, the old replaced by the new. And it retains a consistent amount. But that amount isn't very much. So it is definitely an espresso focused grinder. And so the work flow with this is very very simple, you've got an on/off switch on the side, you've got a lid. Under the lid you have you're bean funnel where you're gonna load your coffee in once you've weighed it. Conical Burr set in here. It's from Mazzer Koney Burrs in here. The funnel is also your grind adjuster, which is nice. It's a step less adjustment with a little indicator on here as well to see where you've been, where you're going. And, coffee in, close the lid, there's a little micro switch here, and turn it on. It really is very very simple. And I think that's a really good thing. Not only for longevity, but in terms of componentry that's gone into this. This is well built, there's a good motor in here. There's a good set of Burrs in here, if you like Conical Burrs. And that's very nearly it. With the exception of one thing, which is this little thing here, which is your dosing cup, which I think is beautifully made because this is juts under 58 mls which means if you want a dose from here into your Portafilter just put your Portafilter on top, upside down and the flip everything over. Zero mess, zero fuss. It's a beautiful little thing that kind of should be available with all coffee grinders. The idea of sort of tipping ground coffee into a Portafilter, the spill, the mess, the new and additional funnel, all of that noise I'm not interested in it. I like this kind of zen approach of what's the least I have to do to get great results? That's really a thing I like a lot. So let's talk about performance. How is it to use to make coffee with? Well, as I said it is a Conical Burr set in there, it's the same Burr set as you might find in a Mazzer Koney. And I am not a huge fan of Conical Burr sets compared to flat Burr sets, my preference has always been for flat Burr sets. I pulled a bunch of shots with this and I had some very very tasty espresso with it. I did pull shots with this against a Mythos one as a kind of benchmarking tool. And I really liked the shots that I got off this. I slightly preferred the shots of the Mythos for having a little bit more clarity to them, which isn't hugely surprising, it's a good flat Burr grinder, I really like the shots from it and the espresso blend I was using was benchmarked against it so, the odds were stacked in the Mythos one's favor. But, I really did enjoy the coffee I got from this thing. Some really nice shots, didn't speed up too much in the second half, didn't show too much in the way of signs of channeling. I was pretty happy with the shots that I got from this thing. I think there's a couple of really neat, clever little things here. Adjusting the grinder's very easy, very intuitive. The spacing between sort of dots and sort of guidance is good. You need to make a decent enough movement to have a substantial change in grinds. You feel like you can tweak quite easily, which is kind of nice on this. There is a calibration function for the little dot under here, if you take it all the way fine. You can then adjust this bottom ring so that it lines up with calibrate and you should be pretty calibrated, grinder to grinder to grinder. Now, this wasn't perfect for me but it was a pretty good starting place and a pretty good idea I think. Certainly you have way more calibration than you would do with most typical grinders that just have a selection of random numbers from zero to nine that you're somewhere on at some point. So, overall pretty happy, and I spent most of the time pulling shots in the middle of the espresso region. In terms of things that I didn't like as much, I wish this held a little bit more coffee. Because sometimes I wanted to make a large batch of coffee with this. I'll often make a liter of coffee and I wanted to use it for filter coffee and it performs pretty well for filter coffee. Again my preference might be for flat Burr grinders but I really enjoyed the coffee I got from this. But you can just sort of get about fifty, fifty five grams in here. I kind of wish it was just a nice even sixty. That's just me. Now if you do want to grind for sort of a medium sized batch filter from a half liter up to a liter, you're gonna be too coarse for the dial. Which is a bit of a shame. I know some people have started putting dots on the other side of their dials to sort of track where they're going with the coarser grind settings and I think that might be an interesting improvement for the future. And I suppose one of the bigger complaints that I have with this is that it does suffer pop-corning a little bit towards the end of grinding a shot. So those last few beans as they're grinding tend to bounce around quite a lot and take a little while to sort of suck them through. You're looking at, at least a twenty second grind time for eighteen to twenty grams of coffee, so it's relatively slow but not so slow that that's a problem for me if I was pulling shots at home or anywhere else. But it does popcorn a little bit. And that means those beans do grind in a way, a little bit coarser than the other beans which isn't ideal. It's not a big problem, like I said it doesn't really damage the shots generally but if you compared let's say, eighteen grams of coffee that had not pop-corned at all by let's say grinding twenty five grams and stopping early to eighteen grams that did have some pop-corning in it, then I would see maybe a four, maybe five second variants in shot time as a result. So having maybe a better orga system, maybe feed beans in, I don't really know what the answer is but I do know that pop-corning does change your grind a lite bit, so the more pop-corning there is the more variants you'll have as a result. That maybe why some of the shots don't have the same kind of clarity as a Mythos with a hopper full of coffee. You know, grinding through like this in any grinder that you'll grind through will produce a small variants in grind setting as a result of those last beans having no force behind them kind of driving them into the Burrs. No weight of coffee behind them. That's true on an EK, that's true if you single dosed a Mythos, that's true if you dosed just sort of anything really, like a Baraza Granda or something like that. Those last few beans on any grinder will popcorn. In some cases they popcorn more than others, that's all. So that's something I'd like to see addressed in the future, and also I'd be interested to see if they ever do build a flat Burr version of this grinder, that would get me very excited indeed, but- I should give you a summary right? Like I should give you a summary of how I feel. And to be honest, charmed, I feel charmed by this grinder, I just really like it. I like the way it's built, I like the design thinking behind it. I think it's really enjoyable to use. If you said how does it stack up against a Mahlkonig EK43? Well I would say that's a very dangerous question to ask, because the EK is a nice set of Burrs, accidentally designed by Mahlkonig at some point, attached to not a particularly compelling grinder. The EK is not beautiful, it's heavy, it's expensive, it's not particularly pleasurable to use, it has a nice set of Burrs. This is a pleasure to use, this sort of highlights a lot of the flaws of a grinder like the EK because of it's ease and pleasure of use. And I'll give you an example of just what feels nice and simple. I got a bag of coffee from a friend and just a small bag, and I wanted to dial it in, and so here I would dose eighteen and a half grams, grind eighteen and a half grams, pull a shot and make an adjustment as necessary. And yeah the retention isn't completely zero, there's a little bit of exchange happening there, but it's so little that you don't need to purge between grinder adjustments, right. I would adjust the grind and just grind a fresh dose straight afterwards. And I had no issues with that. It meant that very quickly, very easily I could dial in to exactly where I needed to be, with almost no excessive waste, right. I got a lot of shots out of a bag of coffee and I don't think I'm alone in people using this grinder. So, from a waste perspective, it's pretty great. The retention is certainly low enough for me to be very very happy with it, I don't think there's any issues with it's retention. It's just a pleasure to use. And so, yeah, the way that this works is that Patreon that fund each month let's me go and buy equipment to review independently. But I wanna keep this, I'm not gonna give it away so I'm gonna buy a brand new one to give away to Patreon backers and this one I'm gonna keep, I kinda just want it around, there's a lot of uses for a grinder like this for me. And it's rare that I wanna add to my collection of stuff. It's rare that I want one more piece of kit in my life. I have enough stuff. The whole point of Patreon is to give it away. I don't want to accumulate endless stuff. The good news is, they build these in one ten and one two twenty volt which means that I can sort of open it up to Patreon backers all over the world it doesn't matter, I'll ship it to wherever it needs to go, and I kind of like that I get to give away a brand new one and it can be white or black and they can choose. I'm gonna keep this one though. Overall I'm impressed, as a sort of first time product, a first time manufacturer, I think they've knocked it out of the park.", "videoID": "FzOY2tHyZ4w"}, {"title": "Deep Fried Coffee\uff1a A Surprising Discovery", "text": "This video is sponsored by Squarespace. Today we're gonna deep fry some coffee. Now you might ask why. You probably should ask why, and I'll give you a couple of different reasons. Firstly, I've kind of always wanted to do it. I remember seeing this years and years ago on a forum, I think coffeegeek.com. Someone had done it and I was like, I should try that one day, and two, well, I think it would be kind of interesting. Allow me just for a minute to nerd out. In the world of coffee roasting, the best analogy in most kitchens is something actually like an air fryer. Now, the way a traditional coffee roaster works, a drum roaster, is that you've got a big spinning drum a bit like a kind of washing machine tumbling the coffee around as a big fan pulls hot air from the burners through the drum. Now in coffee roasting, that air is doing the work. That air is doing most of the roasting. That's convection. There's a little bit of radiant heat. You've got a big cast iron drum that's very hot. That will radiate heat into the coffee. And there's some conduction, too. When the green coffee is touching the hot metal drum, however briefly that might be, there is some conductive heat. A deep fat fryer is a little different. Now we've got some really effective conduction going on here 'cause the very hot oil is gonna transfer heat very effectively into the coffee. I don't know how it's going to go. I don't know how it's gonna make the coffee taste. I don't know if we're really gonna learn anything. But we have to find out. I'm gonna be roasting about 100 grams of a very nice Ethiopian washed coffee, and I picked this because I happen to have some here. I want 100 grams because I don't really wanna crash the temperature of the oil when I put it in, so that's why it's not too much. This oil is about 170 degrees Celsius. We might need to go a bit hotter, but I thought I'd kind of start there, see how it goes. I'm gonna put my coffee gently into my basket. I am a little worried about some beans falling through. I thought this mesh would be fine enough, but maybe I was wrong. And what I'll do is I'll set this up right in front of me so you can have a kind of bird's eye view of the coffee as it roasts. Now I am gonna do this with the lid off. If you fry things at home, you'll know, keep the lid on. That's a good idea. But I'll be very careful and mostly monitoring through the camera. I just wanna see what happens. I wanna see what goes on when you deep fry coffee. That oil is looking hot. We're at 170. All right, good luck, little coffee. Off you go. Ooh, I thought there'd be more fizz. Again, because there's not that much moisture on the surface, you don't get that initial bubbling as whatever moisture evaporates turns to steam. Well, you can see there is some moisture coming out of it. There is some steam, as it roasts, there'll be some CO2 that comes out, other stuff like that, but that's pretty gentle to start with. Color-wise, ooh, going brown, we're going brown. Now it's gonna be pretty hard to roast by color. In a coffee roaster, that's like a traditional drum roaster, the very exterior of the bean will be a little bit darker than the interior of the bean. Here again, I'd expect the very outside to look a fair bit darker than the inside. I don't know how well the heat's transferring, but the bit touching the hottest stuff will go the darkest the fastest, so it's gonna be hard to judge from color, especially 'cause the oil will make it kind of glossy on the outside, too. That's not done yet. It needs to be more fried. But I really don't know how we're progressing. I can think about time and we're nearly 10 minutes into the fry. I don't know if that's a short or a long time for frying coffee. There's not a large body of literature there yet. What's interesting here looking at this is that the color's getting towards where we want it to go, but what's not happening is the kind of puffing up that you would expect from a coffee bean when you roast it. Now, usually in the roasting process, all of this kind of chemistry, this evaporation of moisture that builds up kind of steam pressure inside the bean as well as other gases that kind of builds enough pressure that at some point the bean cracks open, and that's called first crack. And in any roasting process you'd mark when that happens, but that's not happening here. There's no first crack, but I'm surprised, not that there's no first crack, but that beans, I thought they'd puff a little bit more than they have. They're really still very small. That's concerning when it comes time to grind this because it will be less brittle, less porous than a traditional coffee bean, and so grinding it might be really difficult. Okay, I think we're pretty much done. The goal is initially gonna be to get as much oil off these beans as we can. I don't wanna shake this over the fryer because I'm worried about losing beans back into the oil. That means that the basket's gonna be a bit oily when I dump them out onto some paper towel, which I happily have here. It's time to take it out. We lost a fair amount to the fryer. I'm not gonna lie. First, just a quick paper toweling. They're a little greasy still. You see the chaff all over the kitchen towel, which is good over the tea towel. We're not looking too greasy. It's still a bit hot. They're cool enough to touch. You can see we're getting rid of the chaff nicely. There's something kind of weird about the fact that holding a fan over some freshly deep-fried coffee doesn't feel that weird to me, but yeah. So this is cooled now. The fan worked surprisingly well. The oils off. It's not too greasy. You can see there's a number of just underdeveloped, under-fried beans. I'm just gonna screen those out now and then once I've got rid of those, I'll portion out some coffee. You can see here, obviously these shinier-looking, kind of darker-looking beans are the fried beans. This is a same coffee, I think, roasted in a traditional way looking very nice and tasty, but you can see the size difference. You know, the roasted beans, air roasted beans are bigger, puffier than our little deep fried ones. Let's crack open one of these and have a little look inside. So we put a macro lens on to get as close as we can to this, and it's really interesting to see how even this looks. I'm genuinely interested to see how this tastes when we brew it now. I was terrified before. Now I'm just super curious. Now I'm not gonna put this coffee through a fancy grinder. Well, this is a fancy grinder, but this Comandante has suffered over the years of grinding many strange things. This probably, will it be the worst thing it's ground? I don't know. Should I spray that? I should probably still give it a spritz. Maybe it doesn't need a spritz. Maybe oil works as well as water to prevent static. It might just gum up. I just don't know. Ooh! So notes of a hand grinder, you feel an extra layer of like crunchiness to it, like hardness to it, but it's not too bad to grind. Guess let's give it a little sniff. No real static. Maybe a little bit vegetable-y. Am I just thinking about fries, though?  Here we go. Not unusual bloom, little swirl. See how we're looking? Not too gassy. I would say a little gas, little gas. Now I was a little concerned that the oil would clog the filter paper. That doesn't seem to be happening too much, too much, which is good. We're drawing down pretty normally, color's looking okay, it's looking like we made coffee. All right, a bit of a muddy bed. Do deep fried coffee beans produce more fines? We may never know. Well, let's just pour, let's pour a small cup. Let's not be ambitious today. Deep fried coffee, a first for me. Cheers   That's... Good? That's That's good. That's good! It's not like this incredible floral cup of coffee, but it's weirdly good. I'm uncomfortable with this. Let me, one more, one more. If I'm being mean, it's slightly underdeveloped. There's little vegetableyness to it, but the texture is lovely. It's not greasy. It's sort of soft and almost buttery and rich, but not yucky and fatty and ew. I'm a bit confused. Let me put it this way. I've had significantly worse cups of coffee served to me in cafes, in good cafes. This is like a nice cup of coffee. It's not fatty or greasy or weird. It's not remotely acidic, actually. That's kinda weird. It's just sort of soft and round. What I'm not saying is start deep frying your coffee, everybody. This is not the sort of best expression of the raw coffee here. That's a really interesting complex, aromatic, raw coffee that is not an interesting, aromatic cup of coffee, but it is a weirdly nice cup of coffee, and I don't know what to do about that. I don't really know how to deal with that emotionally as much as anything else, and actually, the reduced acidity and the kind of texture of that make me think I need to brew it again a different way. We're gonna need to pull a shot of this. I don't have much coffee. I'm gonna have to get this pretty right or drink some maybe wonky extractions, but I'm gonna do my best. While I get set up and prepped and cleaned down for that, here's a short ad for this video sponsor, which is Squarespace. If you need a website or a domain, then I would recommend Squarespace. Recently, I needed both. I had a new book coming out and I needed to build a website, so I turned to Squarespace because it's so easy for me to put together something that's beautiful and works across every platform, every device. You start with one of their templates and just add in your words, your images. It's so easy to tweak and adjust the little details to make it just how you want it, but at the end of publishing that website, I'm also aware that there's so much more that Squarespace offer. You can do stuff like members-only areas. You can do stuff like email campaigns. You can obviously run it as an e-commerce shop if you wanted to. As I always say, don't take my word for it. Use the link down below and sign up for a free trial. Build something, create your own website, and when you're ready to launch, use code JAMESHOFFMANN for 10% off any website or domain. Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So for the espresso, what we're gonna do is we're gonna dose 18 grams in, aim for 40 out in about 30 seconds, see how that goes. You're gonna paper filter it. I'm gonna use the Weber Unifilter. I'm gonna use a puck screen, too, and we'll see what happens. Now this wasn't the first shot that I pulled and every time I pulled shots, weird stuff weird stuff happened, so this is actually as disgusting as it looks, one of the better looking shots. Now a couple things to note. The 18 gram dose obviously contained quite a lot of oil, and so in the sort of basket, it was sitting really low down, like a kind of 60 in gram dose, so you know, that doesn't bode well for the amount of oil in this thing. It's weirdly cloudy, so obviously a lot has been emulsified in here, which would be why the crema is nonexistent because oil is gonna disrupt the crema very effectively. So even though this is paper filtered, I'd say that's a pretty greasy shot. It looks a bit like, you know, like Bulletproof coffee, the butter coffee thing that goes the same kind of color. Let's not talk about that now. Let's talk about deep fried espresso. Cheers? Do you know... Ooh, kind of got my hopes up after the filter brew that wasn't that bad. That's bad, that's... Okay, don't deep fry your espresso beans. Don't do that. It is greasy. It is greasy in a way that the filter brew wasn't. That's disgusting. That's just disgusting. Don't do that. Oh no, that's worse. That's worse. Like acidic, metallic, harsh, unpleasant, no sweet, no texture, greasy, buttery in the wrong kind of way. Just awful. Oh. Here's the treat. The fattiness makes it linger. It doesn't, the water doesn't help that much. So at last, we have an answer to the age-old question. Should you deep fry your coffee? Probably not, but maybe once if you're kind of curious and you're gonna brew it as filter coffee 'cause it wasn't that bad. I do wonder if I've made potentially a delicious bar snack. Some people like to eat coffee beans. I'm not really a big fan of that. Maybe a deep-fried coffee bean is a better eating experience than a non-deep-fried coffee bean. You wanna lose a tooth, that could be a viable option. Joking aside, I do feel it was interesting to sort of look at the sort of science of roasting with a different kind of medium to do the heat transfer. You know, doing that with a deep fryer, it worked and sort of the science is, sort of the science, it's gonna work.", "videoID": "c6y_3KR7IV4"}, {"title": "ZPM\uff1a The Kickstarter Failure That Revolutionised Espresso", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about this, the ZPM Nocturn. Now, this was a Kickstarter project, it had 1,500 backers and not a single unit was delivered. Now, I didn't think it existed, but it turns out one of my Patreon supporters had one of the beta-testing units, and he got in touch and said, \"Did I want to buy it?\" And yes, yes I did. Now, the story of ZPM is interesting, but what's more interesting to me is that you can draw a line from the failure of ZPM through to the creation of what I think is probably the most influential espresso machines in the last decade, a machine that's kind of revolutionized our understanding of espresso, the Decent DE1. Now before you ask, yes, it does work, and yes, we are gonna make some espresso with it. But let me give you the backstory on ZPM. The Kickstarter campaign launched back on December 11th, 2011, and this was back in the day when videos were kind of charming and not necessarily big budget affairs. Their plan was to use a bunch of off-the-shelf components combined with a couple of their own bespoke pieces, I think their own thermoblock design and group head design, to create a very technically capable espresso machine that was very, very cheap. Their proposed pricing for Kickstarter was $200 for this unit, which was a ridiculous price. Now, the planned retail would be $400, but either way, for the kind of features they were offering, this was a very, very compelling proposition. When the Kickstarter finally closed, they had raised $370,000. Now in, in terms of modern Kickstarters, that's not that much money, but at the time this was the sixth highest funded Kickstarter in its history. Turns out their pricing was perhaps not sustainable. Something we do talk about on this channel is the challenge of manufacturers scaling up what they're doing, and I think people often underestimate how difficult it is to go from some kind of fully functional prototypes, which is essentially what this is, through to mass manufacturing thousands of units. I don't think they had the skill necessarily, I don't think they had the money necessarily to do it. Now, I'm not trying to pick over the bones of it, I just think they were very passionate founders who were perhaps in way over their heads. The project didn't fail quickly. In fact, it was October, 2015, nearly four years after launching, that they posted their final update to Kickstarter. And when they had shared the fact that the company had ultimately failed and they would not be shipping units, the response from their customer base, from their community, was angry. So angry in fact, that it generated enough interest for the New York Times to come and write a piece about ZPM and its community. Now, if you read the article and it is linked in the description down below, towards the end of the piece, you were introduced to a new character in all of this, that of John Buckman. Now John, you may know as the founder, the creator of the Decent Espresso machine. And in the piece, he's in talks with ZPM to kind of buy the remnants of the company. Seeing as John is in London right now, I thought I would just go and ask him in person about how his interactions and experience with ZPM maybe influenced his creation of the DE1. - So firstly, I saw the ZPM video and I felt like it was gonna be quite hard for me to figure out how to make espresso, 'cause I had no guide. And when I saw this video of these two nerdy guys and they were both technologists, and I'm a technologist, and I thought \"I'm gonna trust them to be my guides into espresso.\" And they told me what grinder to by, which was great, 'cause I didn't know that either. While they were falling apart, my businesses were falling apart too. I had a music business and a book swapping business, and that was all cratering, and I was looking for something else to do. They, one day, sent an email out saying, \"We can't ship, we've run out money, we're really sorry.\" At which point, I happen to be in California, I give them a call. I say, \"Hello, it sounds like you need a little bit of money.\" 'Cause they said, \"We're so close to the finish line, we just need another million.\" or something, I don't remember what the number was. And I thought, \"Okay, well I can write that check, and take over, and be a little bit of adult supervision.\" They brought the ZPM over with Blue Bottle beans, and they made me a quite good espresso. And so, there it was, working, making good coffee. The next thing I did was call up a friend in Seattle, because I happened to know La Marzocco, and Slayer, and Synesso are up in Seattle. And Bill Crossland, who'd been involved with the GS3, was one of the people who was willing to talk to me. Now, he makes the machine called the CC1, and what Bill said is, \"Let me show you, kid, what the economics are of espresso.\" And he laid it all out to me and he said, \"There's just no way you're gonna make a machine better than mine, at a cheaper price.\" \"What if I just sell direct, then could I spend more money to make a better machine?\" And he said, \"If you're willing to sell direct only, yes, you can make a better machine.\" So, Bill essentially sent me in that direction, and he also said, \"Don't buy ZPM, because it'll never get safety certification.\" And that was just him, his background, \"You're just gonna die on that altar.\" And in fact they were dying on that altar, that's what they were talking about, was the safety certification was never gonna happen. But the real birth of Decent Espresso is finding that, I think there's a market for, what I call at the time, Seattle meet Italy. So, Italian espresso, which is what I liked at the time, but with a sort of Seattle spin of high tech, app, that sort of thing. And that would hopefully reduce the complexity of making good espresso. And then the second part, which was the launch of Decent Espresso, is everyone telling me, \"For the amount you will spend to make ZPM come to market, you can start from scratch with people who've made espresso machines before, and you won't have any of their problems.\" But, of course, I had new problems, but that's why I went in a new direction. Because I decided to start from scratch and make my own machine, the ZPM guys said, \"Hey, wait a second.\" \"We've shown you everything, you need to cut us in here.\" And they're absolutely right, right. I saw this schematics, the software, I saw everything, and that was influencing the decisions I was making. So, it took a while, but we got to a point where they licensed their intellectual property to us so we could choose to use, it if we wanted to, in exchange for some money, and most importantly, a coupon to all the backers of ZPM that they could apply in the next three years to Decent. It took me about nine months to fall out of love with the approach that ZPM were taking. Because I tried the same approach, which is used cheap components, and a bit of software, and algorithms, PID dust, that little magic fairy dust, PID will solve everything, that didn't work at all. My ambition for a machine that I would sell for $1,000 US well, we had no product. And so, what I thought I could make for $1,000 US using essentially two Nespresso machines bolted together, would not make good coffee. So, this became now a multi-year R&amp;D project. And it turned out that heating on demand is incredibly inaccurate on espresso. And so, we had to come up with new technologies to deal with that. What I realized was, that we had no idea how to make espresso good with light roast beans. That was actually the problem I wanted to solve. I had this very strong feeling that the entire espresso industry was pre-scientific. They don't measure anything, they don't create testable hypotheses. And testable hypotheses and measurement are the basis of science. And we had no idea what pressure flow and temperature would make delicious light-roasted coffee. So, let's just make sure that it can do anything. And in the computer world, we talk about Turing machines, which is a computer that can run any software. The idea behind the Decent was to make a Turing-compliant espresso machine. So, an espresso machine that could do any pressure, any flow, any temperature, because we have no idea what's gonna work. In so doing, it became quite expensive to make, and became a much harder project, but it also became much more interesting. So what ZPM really did for me, is get me interested, get my team together, and look at cheap components, and see what we could do with cheap components to make good espresso. And it turns out, that if you spend millions of dollars and develop all this intellectual property, you can actually take the inexpensive components and get them to do your bidding. - And so that is how we go from the ZPM to the DE1, very different approaches, but an interesting connecting point between the two. And I cannot understate just how influential this thing has been. By letting us track everything, measure everything our understanding of espresso has fundamentally changed how we see flow, how we think about channeling, all of that stuff has been revolutionized by the DE1. And I think it's fair to call it the most influential machine in a decade. But this is not a review of the DE1, that will happen eventually on this channel, this is a video about the ZPM. It's finally time to fire this thing up, and see what it's capable of doing. Before we do that though, there is a short ad for this video sponsor, which is Surfshark. Surfshark is a fast, easy-to-use VPN service that is jam-packed full of features and lets you use unlimited devices with just one account.

Thank you to Surfshark for sponsoring this video. Let's switch it on. Every time I turn it on my heart is in my mouth because I'm terrified I'm just gonna break this thing and then it'll be gone. You know what I mean? Like it's, I dunno if I could repair this. Someone could, but I couldn't. Anyway, it's on, it's heating up, little temperature display here. It rockets up in temperature, which is kind of interesting, which has got a little thermoblock to heat in there. Now, this is obviously a US machine, that's running on 110V, I've got a chunky transformer under the bench here to allow me to run this thing on UK power. But while it's heating up, we'll do a quick tour of the machine. It's pretty simple, but there's a couple of notable things on this particular unit. So, obviously you've got your display on the front here. It's not a bad display, considering its age and the price point, it's not horrific. It's not touch, that's okay. You've got these control buttons here and this is something I'm definitely terrified of breaking. They just feel really flimsy and soft, and I have to be very delicate here. Two sturdier buttons, one that says \"Start\" and one that says \"Mode.\" So, because it's a thermoblock, if you wanna steam milk, then you'd have to change the temperature of the sort of thermoblock to get steam. So, it can't do both at once. That's kind of it, on the front panel here, little drip tray, pretty nice. Now, you can see a water tank here. Actually, if I turn this to the side, you can see that the water tank does not fit, 'cause this would've been a custom part that would've cost a lot of money to make. They didn't get that far. So this is just, I assume some other machine's water tank that sort of fits well enough, but it works. Also worth noting here, you appear to have a mini USB and an SD card slot. And impressively, we're actually up to temperature on the front. So, we've got a little ready symbol at the top. It says 95, 94.9 degrees Celsius, lovely to see it in Celsius, didn't even put that on myself, but the correct temperature display. So, let's get into the menus of this thing because it gives a real insight into how this was gonna work, in terms of what you could program and what you could do with this thing. So, you've got a couple of pre-programmed options here. You've got single, which shows 93 Celsius, nine bars, 25 seconds. So, 25 seconds says that they're looking at like a fixed time, not a fixed volume of brewing. A few machines work this way, they'll brew a fixed amount of time, and you would adjust your grind to get the flow rate that you want, to get the kind of yield you want in that fixed time. Interestingly, the double pre-programmed here, same temperature, same pressure, 35 seconds. Which I hope is not suggesting that a single is just like a double cut earlier, 'cause that would be wrong. You've then got settings, which we can jump into. And then I think you've got like a more manual thing where it's gonna do the temperature and pressure that you want, but it won't cut off after a certain amount of time. Settings, is again interesting. So, you can adjust your PID values around a bunch of different stuff. So, if we jump in, obviously your brew temperature and we tap in there. So you can set your proportional gain, you can set your integral gain, or you'll set your derivative gain. I dunno how to program a PID, if I'm totally honest. So, I'm not gonna mess with these values. Now, on the back screen, there's a little bit of immaturity in this machine. And so, the fact that it says \"Back that ass up.\" I don't know, I don't think you should build that into a daily espresso machine, it just feels kind of weird. It just feels a little bit childish, if I'm honest. It's not that I'm against immaturity, but you know. I don't know, it's just a weird little thing. I don't know if it would've made it to production if it was just for the beta units or something, but there it is. We should make some coffee. Pour, I think we're just gonna pour manual, I think that's a good idea. I'm gonna brew it 94, I think. And I'm gonna brew at eight bars, 'cause why not? And there it is, it's programmed very quickly. So, from a programming perspective, this is kind of a joy to use, this really is. But can it make good coffee? So, let's brew and this is interesting. So, right now it's kind of getting prepped. You can see negative pressure, it's seemingly filling the hydraulic circuit, getting ready, timer reads zero still. Once we switch to positive pressure,  okay, timer's on. Only about four bars of pre-infusion, and then it's gonna really spike it up. So it's overshot there, so we're gonna need some PID control work done. Drops back down to about eight bars, which is good. Temperature, a little high. Now it pulled a little longer than I'd want, but I think it's still worth tasting. Now, actually, just on the temperature gauge here, it's dropped down to like 80 degrees Celsius. So, I wonder if it's got a bit of a declining profile here with the heating stuff. Now some of you, like me, were you a backer? Watching this, are you thinking \"Did I miss out or does it suck?\" Let's find out. It's got a weird acidity to it that makes me feel like the brew temperature is not quite right. Actually, we could probably test that. We do have a Scace device that we can test the brew temperature with and see what it's actually doing, in terms of temperature and pressure delivered onto the puck. Maybe we should do that. Let's repeat this, and actually see what's happening inside the machine versus what it's telling us it's happening. Okay, so we've got a Scace 2 device set up here. This has a temperature probe inside there and a flow restrictor to mimic the flow rate of an espresso that's running to this laptop. You can, sort of, in a second, see what this sort of screen recording of this is. You also have a pressure gauge here, which is the sort of pressure, including the loss of pressure through the puck. So typically, this would read about a bar lower than you would see at a pump. So, if it was nine bars at the pump, you'd see eight at the group head, 'cause you're losing about a bar of pressure through the cake. Anyway, let's see what happens when we pull a shot. So we're coming up to pressure here, coming way up. Now, that's quite a big discrepancy. Oh, that's interesting. So looking at the brew temperature, it briefly spikes to about 91 degrees Celsius and then just crashes back down really, really quickly. And so, it's brewing way below, sort of, target temperature almost the entire time. There's a little leakage here, a pressure issue here. I think there's a problem with the grouphead solenoid. We'll touch on that in just a second. Hang on, let me stop this. Now, this was a beta testing unit that was out in the wild. So, this has been sort of shipped, so to speak, to somebody to test. And so, you'd expect it to perform a little bit more within spec than it was. So what you were seeing was it was thinking it was delivering about nine bars of pressure. What you were seeing at the puck though, was substantially below what you'd expect. The temperature piece though, really, really just miles away. And so, I don't know at this point, if it just needs its settings tweaked, but that kind of makes me a little hesitant to think that's the problem, that's the issue, or if maybe it was never ever gonna do what they really needed it to do. It's an interesting artifact of its time. It's definitely got some interesting ideas in there. It's a sad story that they didn't get to deliver what they wanted to deliver. But I'm left wondering if they were ever gonna deliver something that would've lived up to the expectations of the community and to the sort of technical expectations of really good, accurate espresso brewing? Now to caveat myself, again, and over, and over again, this has sat, you know, not making much coffee for quite a long time. I think there's something trapped inside the grouphead solenoid. That's a little sort of electromagnetic valve that pulls a piston up and down to control a three-way valve, and sometimes stuff gets trapped in there causing a kind of leak of pressure from the boiler itself, sort of through the system, and you'll see the group head dripping sometimes. So, this is not maybe in peak, peak condition, but what its sensors are showing versus what we're reading with these sort of mechanical readings or accurate readings of temperature are quite a long way apart. And that would be a huge concern for me, even if the maths was a little better, at staying on target when it was supposed to a little bit more accurately, it just seems to not really know what it's doing, in that particular regard. And I dunno why that may be the case, I don't know if that's bad build, if that's bad componentry, if that's something else, they're using cheap parts by their own admission, maybe that was the issue. There's lots I like about this, I like the form of it. I think it looks kind of cute, it's boxy in a charming way. I like the interface, it's simple, it let me do what I needed to do, but I'm not sure it delivered.", "videoID": "GKA2COJRt6M"}, {"title": "The Chemex", "text": "Today's video is the first in a new occasional series, looking at icons of coffee, classics in the field, things that have endured, and I can think of nothing better to start us off with, than the Chemex coffee maker. Now these videos aren't so much pure technique videos, nor are they pure product reviews. They'll have a little bit of those in there, along with a few other bits and pieces. And we'll start with the history of the Chemex. While the Chemex feels a gi-g quintessentially, American coffee maker, it's inventor was actually born in Germany. Dr. Peter Schlumbohm was drawn to the US by it's patent laws and he was an inventor and he patented, I think over 300 different items, though this was by far the most successful and long lasting of them. He patented the Chemex in 1941 and it was ultimately released and produced in 1942 by the Chemex Corporation. It's an incredibly simple, yet beautiful design. It's just a single piece of glass with a wooden collar and a tie, and it's distinctive design means that you might have seen it pop up in tons of pop culture on TV and in movies. You might have seen it in an episode of Friends. You might have seen it in Mad Men, or even in Interstellar. People really love the Chemex. They formed an emotional attachment to it as a brewer and therefor, to the coffee that it makes, as well, but let's talk about why some people really don't like the Chemex, and that means, we can look at two piece of it's design, that I think, are distinctive and fundamental. There are other aspects of the design to talk about, be it the little wooden collar, or the glass handle on the other version. What I'm interested in looking at, initially, is the design decision to make this a single piece of glass, to have both brewing cone and the base, all as one thing. That's not particularly common and actually presents a surprising little challenge, and the challenge is that, when you're brewing, it wouldn't be possible, in theory, for an airlock to happen. If air cannot freely flow from the bottom chamber, to be displaced by the coffee coming in, then it'll build up a little bit of pressure and coffee will stop flowing from the cone into the base, below. Now, to counteract that, there are two things here. Firstly, you have this particular channel here, that runs all the way down into the base, and that's really designed, not just to pour nicely, which thankfully it does do, but also to allow air out of the base section during a brew. But what can happen, is the paper can form a perfect seal with the glass, all the way around, and then you're in trouble, then you'll stall your brew. Now, to counteract that, there is the design of the Chemex papers. So, a Chemex paper looks like this. It's a very large piece of paper, which is kind of a problem, but it's folded in such a way, that when you brew, one side of you cone is much, much, much thicker than the other side of the cone. When you're brewing, you're really supposed to make sure that the thick side is where the little channel is, where the air gap is, where the spout is. This means that this paper is less likely to collapse and form a seal. The downside of this design, is that you have so much paper. Not only, a Chemex paper is much thicker, but having a triple ply on one side, really does affect the way that the coffee brews. For context, a single Chemex paper weighs just under four and a half grams. A single two-cup Hario paper weighs about 1.5 grams. It's literally three times the amount of paper, and potentially, three times the amount of paper taste, if you don't rinse that out, and also, three times the kind of clarifying power. Having a lot of thick paper will change the way that your coffee tastes. It will taste cleaner in some ways. You'll definitely remove a about as much suspended material, as you possibly can, and that's, for most people, that's a good thing. People like a clean tasting cup of coffee. Your filter paper will add a little bit of resistance to the way that the coffee brews that cone. Not only does the water have to get through your bed of coffee, it has to get through the paper, as well. What I tend to see, is two things as a result. I see people trying to grind just a little but coarser, to get shorter brew times with the Chemex, and as a result, having a slightly weaker brew. I often see people, also using higher doses in a Chemex, than they would do in, say, a V60 or a Kalita or another brewer. Ultimately, this is just a mechanism of dealing with the potential th-und-er extraction. This is not a flawed brewer, but you do have to make some accommodations to not get into a spiral of up-dosing and under-extracting. We'll come onto that in just a second. Before I get too much into the technique stuff, though, I do wanna talk about a couple of the different options that you have and shapes and finishes, I guess. This, to me, this is the classic Chemex, this shape, this size and actually this little wooden collar. But I won't lie to you, this collar is a terrible piece of design in may ways. It's a incredibly frustrating to use. To tie and untie this thing, it's not good, it's not fun, it's annoying. To have to take it off to put into the dishwasher or to clean it properly, is annoying and I don't think the wood ages particularly well, but, as I just look at it, I think it looks beautiful. I really like the wood-collar look, and I think it photographs well, it just looks great. But, the alternative is popular with a lot of people, which is this one, and this is the one that doesn't have the wood collar and it just has the glass handle, so you'd have something, not hot to hold when you're doing it. Now, I'm not saying that this is ugly or hideous or it doesn't look good. It's more practical, despite the fact that, in theory, it's more breakable, but it just doesn't look, it just doesn't look as good, as the original Chemex. Now, there is another chape. There's the smaller shape. I would say, probably don't bother with it. I don't particularly like that sort of steeply-angled brewing dynamic, but I also don't think it has the proportions and the, just, aesthetic loveliness of the original shape and size. Let's talk about technique. Let's talk about how I might recommend that you change your brewing technique, specifically for the Chemex. Now, a lot of this is based on the V60 technique that I put out there, if you haven't seen that, there's a link up here. I'd recommend watching that, but before watching this, 'cause it'll make more sense. But, let's talk about this thing, here. Now, I'm gonna say it, we're gonna keep our dose at 60 grams per liter, I certainly enjoy that. If you like stronger coffee, feel free to change that. Now, one of the key things here, is to not try to compensate too much for the additional resistance that the paper adds. In a simple experiment, we brewed a Chemex next to a V60, with the same grind setting. Same dose, same pouring technique, and the brew from the Chemex just took much, much, much longer. That's okay. You don't have to compensate and grind much coarser for the Chemex, to get that three, three-and-a-half-minute brew time. You're gonna have four to five minute brew times, brewing half a liter with the Chemex, and you're gonna have great-tasting coffee. In terms of the bloom, I would do exactly the same, as I do in the V60. Two to one, to three to one, in terms of bloom water to coffee dose, so, 60 grams of bloom to 90 grams of bloom, if you're brewing 30 grams of coffee, and let that bloom for at least 45 seconds. I would say, a similar pouring technique, in terms of phases to the V60 video, and at the end, you're gonna do the same things with a little stir and then a swirl, to help the draw down and have a flat bed. There is one more little hack that I have seen, that is actually useful to have in your reserves. Now, I talked about the issue before, of what happens if you're paper perfectly adheres and sticks to the glass all the way around, and you get that airlock. What I have seen people do, is use something like a chopstick, and having a chopstick in the brewer seems a little weird, but it does help prevent the paper, perfectly sticking to the glass. It will always leave air a space to get out, and it will not cause your brew to stall, but, know that you are sticking a piece of wood in your coffee. Now, you could go, visit my, like a Korean chopstick, which is made out of stainless steel, which is great, or a high-quality chopstick, it'll probably be okay, but maybe not a cheap disposable one. Better still, really, is just to be mindful of this gap, of this spout. Pay attention to it, make sure it doesn't close, after you've rinsed your paper, and do make sure you rinse your papers, the Chemex papers. Just make sure that it's tight across that gap, and it isn't beginning to fold into it. That's really important. I'll say one more quick thing about the Chemex. One more thing, that for me, just elevates it a little bit. Coffee looks beautiful in a Chemex. The way that the light shines through coffee in a Chemex, it is just a little bit special, and it took me a little while to work out, why it's like this with the Chemex and not so much with another brewer, and I actually think, it's to do with this little base piece of the design, here. It just catches the light differently, to say, a drip decanter, and just brings a little bit more color and hey, we even drink with our eyes, too. Coffee never looks more vibrant, more red, more beautiful, more delicious, than it does in a Chemex, and that matters to me. But I'd love to hear your stories about the Chemex. Tell me about how it fits into your life.", "videoID": "ikt-X5x7yoc"}, {"title": "My Restored Vintage Lever Machine Arrives!", "text": "On the previous episode. Not far from here is the workshop of Enrico Maltoni. This is the taste of history. I have to convince Enrico to sell me something. - And when you see it again in a future video, you'll see the after, you'll see the restored version. And I'll tell you if you're around London, maybe how you can drink some coffee. It's finally here! It has arrived. The machine from 1958 has been restored, Enrico has shipped it inside this crate. It's time to open it up and have a look. Let's go straight up. Up, up, up, up, up, up. Now you probably think it's a bit harsh of me to pixelate it, and being a tease. Fine, I'll turn the pixelation off, but honestly, did you think I was gonna show you the finished machine at this point in the video? No, no, no, we need to get this installed at Prufrock, and that's gonna take a while. Enrico's gonna come over and join us for some installation, some training, some fun. In the meantime, I wanna talk about the coffee that we wanna serve from this thing. Okay, first I need to make what might sound like a contentious statement. I'm gonna kinda throw myself under the bus. I don't think specialty coffee roasters really, really know all that much about blending. That might seem hard to defend. I don't think it is. I will say this. Blending specialty coffees is just kind of like making a fruit salad, like as long as you have good tasty ripe fruit in the mix, it's pretty good. Sure, some mixes, some salads are better than others, but really we're just kind of focused on getting the best tastiest, ripest fruit into the mix. The tradition of kind of blending to an end goal of kind of crafting something that maybe stays consistent over time, all of that kind of stuff, I don't think specialty roasters know that much about. And I think our lack of experience really showed up in this particular project. When you're trying to work out what to serve on an old espresso machine, it doesn't feel right to serve modern espresso. That's kind of built and benchmarked against modern espresso machines. We needed something different. And so we decided to kind of go back to the drawing board, or go back to the origins in a way. And we bought a bunch of old school traditional Italian espresso and we tasted it. The goal for the tasting was this: taste a bunch of coffee and just describe the things that you really like. Ignore the things that you don't. And then by collecting the words that we liked, we kind of built a brief for a blend. Like what kind of textures, what kind of flavors were we chasing? But I think we underestimated how difficult that would be, but along the way, you know, I think the roasting team especially learned a ton about kind of roasting for this style of espresso, as well as blending for this style of espresso and I think it's really interesting. I don't generally like talking about the coffee we roast on this channel. I kind of really go to great lengths to avoid it. I feel like I have to talk about it 'cause it's part of the entire experience that we're trying to kind of make for somebody, kind of the fun of the whole thing. But just know that I don't really wanna do that. I'll talk about the end result briefly a little bit later on. I'll probably be awkward. We'll see. Anyway, anyway, enough about that. Let's go and talk about getting the machine live, installed into a public place where people can drink coffee from it. And so for the second time in two days, we are on our way to Prufrock, and we're going to Prufrock for a tasting event tonight. Last night, we were installing the machine. So Enrico and Matteo had come over from Italy to make sure that the install went really well. And there's two reasons for that. Firstly, most of the restored machines like this don't go into working cafes, not busy cafes. And secondly, using one of these as a barista is really, really different, and there's a kind of safety aspect that is a concern. But tonight, we're doing a kind of practice tasting for the Square Mile team actually to come down and do the side by side tasting that we do. Just to kind of give a sort of soft opening. But when I get into Prufrock, I'm gonna get behind the machine and I'll show you the controls and the way it works, and why people might need that little bit more training. So this is the business end of the machine. This is the barista end of the machine you can see right here. And in terms of things that are stressful, we'll start right down here with this little lever here, right? Like this is a fill or empty kind of a thing here because the machine is a manual fill machine, right? There's a boiler inside that you have to fill. And you know how full it is because over here, you've got a level, right? So that's the water level inside the boiler. And if that runs low, you would expose the element, burn it out, and it's dead. It's just done. So while you're working, all of the water from the machine comes from that main steam boiler. So you're constantly throughout the day filling it back up again over and over and over again. You don't want it to be too full, that's bad, but you don't want it to be too empty. So in working this, you certainly have to pay attention to something you've never had to pay attention to before. Hot water tap in the middle. And that's if you lift up this valve, that's where you would get hot water from. This is so good. Steam is what that says, and it's one valve for both steam arms, and the the steam arms are fixed steam arms here. The way this works is you take this valve. If you twist it that way, steam would come out of here, and if you twist it this way, steam would come out of here, which is frankly - which is a lot. As for the lever grips themselves, they're pretty standard if you know levers. Portafilters. Weirdly small. I've gotta say like I have big hands, but it's like a weirdly small portafilter. If I go and get like a modern portafilter, that's like normal size. Let me get them side by side. There you go, there's a little side by side. So it's weirdly small. We put VST baskets in there 'cause we want the coffee to be as tasty as possible. If you were running this thing on gas as you might have done back in the day, that was the gas input line. Obviously, we're running this on power. It's only a two kilowatt element in the back there so it's not huge. We're gonna start, you know, getting coffee ready for the team. Cups are ready. Coffee is ready. We're gonna be serving the coffee on these little trays. Here you go, which I'll explain a bit more in just a second. It's a little noisy inside, and I just quickly wanna talk about the coffee that we're gonna serve on the machine. We made a limited edition blend called Il Grifone. It's kind of a love letter to Italian espresso. So aiming for the things that we like about classic Italian espresso. Texture, sweetness, chocolate, like genuine chocolate. All of those things should be in there, and it's fun. Got the machine in the bag. It's kind of a nice thing. And we feel like that's the kind of right thing to serve on a lever machine so you can have this contrasting experience between like the new school of Red Brick on a Black Eagle with all the technology, versus this on a lever, which is very old school. And if you get the tray, you can scan a QR code you can tell us what you think of each coffee, tell us your preference, that kind of stuff. It's just, I hope just fun. That's the point of this. This will be quite hard to get 'cause it's really limited and it's really only available here and online in very small amounts. So I'm gonna give away 20 bags to anyone that wants it.

But now, I suspect you want something that involves me just being quiet and letting you see this beautiful espresso machine making some coffee. And so it's live. It's live now behind me over there. I think it's over there. Yeah, we're serving coffee. It's happening. It's gonna be happening for about six weeks from when this video goes up or until we run out of coffee. The machine's beautiful. Like, Enrico did an amazing job with this thing. It's like having a brand new machine, but from the 1950s. Oh, and the machine historically was hanging out in Lake Garda. So maybe it served fancy coffee to fancy people a long time ago. And that's it. I'm kind of curious to talk to the baristas after this to see how they feel about having to sort of drive a car without power steering for six weeks. Do they miss all of the mod cons of like a modern espresso machine? Or is it just a very enjoyable, very slow, deliberate experience? We'll find out. You're gonna ask me what am I gonna do with the machine next? I don't know. I honestly don't know. I don't feel like this is gonna be the end of its journey, but I don't really know where it goes next. If you have any ideas, leave them down in the comments below and I'll update you on what happens at the end of this run. That's it.", "videoID": "bGw5ZSdVAkA"}, {"title": "The Bizarre And Surprising Coffee Of The Nespresso Vertuo", "text": "Today, we're going to talk about this. It's the Nespresso Vertuo system, and it's ridiculous, gloriously ridiculous in some ways, just bizarrely ridiculous in others, but I think it's interesting and definitely worth talking about. Now, if you're not familiar with the Vertuo system, you are probably familiar with the classic Nespresso capsule system. You had these little things, five to six grams of coffee in them, and you could make a sort of espresso thing with them, and they were, let's just say, popular. The world has changed and they have their new thing. It came out 2014, but really no one talks about it, and it's just so weird that I kind of want to talk about it, and this is the system. So these pods are the Vertuo pods and they look quite different to the old ones, and they come in three sizes of hump, I guess, three dome sizes. You've got the little one, which is for an espresso type thing. You've got the medium hump for, I suppose, a Lungo, and then I suppose most interestingly to me, you've got this, a big dome for a filter coffee. Now, I am dumb enough to go and read the patent for this thing and dig through the fairly dense language, and within it, there's some interesting stuff, right? There's kind of the why of this whole system. Now, before we get into the sort of technical stuff, you should just see how this thing works, because you're going to have some questions. Completely unnecessary touch there. This goes in the middle here, and it drops into a little pod holder, and when you drop this down, you'll hear it puncture. Now, when I press go, it's going to do a bunch of different stuff. Firstly, it's going to spin it around and read a barcode that is on the underside of the capsule. Then it's going to pre-infuse a little bit, right? And then it's going to spin the capsule at several thousand RPM while pumping water through it, and what we get is kind of weird. It keeps going. This is a lot to me. I suppose the audience here is possibly divided. I don't find that appetizing, right? Like, I don't find that weird layer of foam. I'm not going to call it crema because it seems to be a whole other thing. I mean, look at the way it breaks down. It just gets weird and bubbly. If you read the patents, the kind of why of the system is that they wanted to be able to build a machine that made filter coffee with a thick layer of persistent crema that wasn't over-extracted, right? Then they would say, if you did this with an espresso machine, it would be over-extracted and taste very bitter. Our system allows you to brew a big cup of coffee with a thick layer of coffee foam on top that isn't over-extracted. Now, you might well ask, why would you want a lot of coffee foam, a lot of crema-esque stuff, on top of your drink? Nespresso have done research in the past to do with how that layer of foam in their beverages elevates the sort of taste sensation from a tactile as well as aromatic perspective. So maybe that's the kind of play here, but that is wild, right? Like, that is a very weird drink to me to make, and that, it's lasting. I think, in the patent, they said it would last for at least 180 seconds to retain a certain percentage of its original volume. Should we have a taste? Also in the patent is a reference to the fact that, this system, it works much better with dark roasts, and that is a darker roast. Right, like, that's much darker than I would choose to drink, and it has this very intense bitterness. Would I say it tastes over-extracted? Honestly, probably, no, I wouldn't say it tastes over-extracted. It just tastes of very dark-roasted coffee, pretty well extracted. From that perspective, it's kind of a success, but this whole thing, just watch the way when I open it up, it dispenses and gets rid of the old capsule. It's just so much. Bye. It's just bizarre. Let me get the capsule out, 'cause that's also interesting. So, you can start to see how the system is working. So this thing drops in and it punctures it from above and it simultaneously punctures all the way around the edges. When you spin this, obviously, there'll be some compression as the centrifugal forces kind of push the coffee outwards, and the theory here is if you pump water in, it goes through this coffee and then out, and you have this very even extraction, because you've got all this kind of centrifugal force pushing the coffee out the whole time. It does some weird stuff. If we just cut this open and have a look inside, secondly, you can see this giant hole where the water would have sort of gone in, and also the space that would have been left by the centrifugal force. Why? Why would you do this? Why is this the solution? And I suppose the answer is a couple of things. Firstly, there is the thing that they claim, right? Which is this is an innovative way of brewing because you get this crema on top on your big beverages and they don't taste over-extracted, and that's kind of an interesting claim, right? And we can test that in a little bit and sort of play with that a little bit more. Obviously, the second part of this whole puzzle is that Nespresso have had a taste of what it's like to have a defensible technology and to rule a marketplace, to completely dominate. Let me just clean up a little bit. Let's talk about these again. Now, this was Nespresso's beginnings, right? Their whole company began with the kind of this thing here, the pod, but this pod does not have their coffee inside. This has some delicious specialty coffee inside. Now, how you feel about specialty pods, it's another video. Go back to 2013, and there's a court case between Dualit in the UK and Nespresso, because Dualit were making their own Nespresso pods, and you know, they make the machines too, but they were making pods and Nespresso said, no, that's naughty. We've got the patent. You can't do it. And Dualit said, well, we think we can. We think that you don't actually have protections around some of this stuff, so we think we can make pods, and it went to court, and Dualit won. Now, if you want a tiny piece of coffee trivia, when Dualit went to court, they brought an expert witness, a guy called Martin Nicholson. That name may be familiar to you, because he's the guy that invented the Niche Zero Grinder. It's a small world. Back on topic, Nespresso no longer dominate these things. You can get everything from just nice washed coffee through to fancy, fancy, natural process Geshas. The world of these little pods has gone crazy. Now, Nespresso aren't really trying to defend these the same way that they were back in 2013. They're still a bit defensive, but they're also kind of pushing this much harder. Now, I should quickly mention, in the world of spinning coffee things, there is a machine apparently called The Spinn. You might've seen it on some bigger tech channels. It's popped up a couple of times. They have offered me a unit, but because they've been on back order, they've been taking pre-orders for I think six or seven years now without really shipping, I have said no to it, but it does look like they're doing something a little bit similar with that. So maybe there is something in this whole centrifugal thing. That is something I want to look at a little bit more. If you go into the patents, Nestle say that they're actually brewing under relatively low pressures inside there, and you can't really convert centrifugal force to a pressure, to a brew pressure, right? Because brew pressure, well, that requires a resistance. You might have a force of water hitting the coffee, but the pressure it builds up is kind of to do with the resistance of the coffee. So it doesn't create a fixed pressure necessarily, but it is still pushing water through coffee in this weird and interesting way. What I want to do now just quickly is show you one thing that I find super interesting. We're going to track the flow of a brew, right? I'm going to brew another of those big, long coffees onto a little Acaia scale. I'm gonna use the smart espresso profiler app that will let me track the output flow. If you think about traditional espresso, your initial flow is quite slow, and then it picks up speed towards the end, because you're eroding the coffee, right? You're destroying the resistance, and so if you're having like a fixed force in, you'd have a faster flow out, and you'd also have a lower pressure, but we're getting off topic. Let's brew a big cup of coffee and see what happens. I'm going to show you the screenshot of the brew as it happens, 'cause it's interesting. So we're holding really steady at like 2.6, 2.7 grams a second, coming out. Like, really steady. We've crept up a little bit to like 2.8, but really, it's sort of where it is. Barely any increase this entire brew. That's weird. Now, you heard it spin up at the end there, I think to just dry out the capsule, to get as much liquid out as is possible. I mean, that is a weird brew. I've never seen anything like that in an espresso type system. We should see how an espresso brews, actually. Let's check that. Now, that sounds like a much lower RPM, but the flow rate is holding just really steady. Now, that's interesting to me, because that is that kind of classic Nespresso profile of taste where they've got more coffee in the capsule, so they're pulling a longer shot. That's like 36 grams of espresso out, but from still a relatively low coffee dose. In fact, let's just quickly weigh that now. Let's weigh the three sized capsules and see what the difference is, see what the kind of dose is for each of them. Show me your secrets. Now, this espresso is pretty fine. That is still a small pod. That is seven and a half grams only in that capsule, which is more than a traditional Nespresso capsule, but not by much. Now, for your Lungo, your 150 ml beverage, but you've got a bit more coffee. You're at 10 and a half grams, 10.6 grams of coffee, and then again, it's pretty, pretty dark. And so to get a full cup, to get a 230 ml cup, you know, I would be brewing, you'd be brewing 14 or 15 grams of coffee. What are they brewing? That's not ungenerous, but it's 13 grams, so 13 in 230 out, that's obviously more liquid in, but you would, you know, think about liquid out. If we know the the weight of coffee in, and we know the weight of liquid out, and we've got a refractometer to measure the speed of light through coffee, then we can know if their promise is true. How much of this are they extracting, right? We can measure it. We can calculate it. We have the technology. Okay, so we've got 230 grams of beverage. We're going to push it through a little filter to make sure there's no undissolved material in the way. Now, I'm not going to lie. This looks quite weak. Now, I was actually wrong on the strength. I was kind of thrown by it. The strength is reasonable. It's about 1.3% coffee in terms of the beverage. If you imagine like a beer is 4% alcohol, this is 1.3% coffee, the rest is just water, and that means, you do the maths. The extraction's around 23%, right? Like, we can get into the offsets for moisture and CO2. I don't want to do that. We can just say that's very extracted, not absurdly extracted, but thoroughly extracted, and I wouldn't describe that as being over-extracted necessarily. Now, the question that I have, really, is, how much of this is just the coffee itself? It's very well-ground It's roasted in a certain way It's going to be soluble How much is the tech? How much is the machine? How special is the machine? So, in just a minute, I'm going to take on the machine. It's going to be man versus machine, and then also machine versus machine, but before that is a short ad for this video's sponsor, Surfshark.

I've got some water at about 85, a little bit lower, actually, because I checked the outlet temperature here, and it was sort of 78, 79. I don't think they're losing much heat, and I think they do have a patent for heating the kind of collection area around the pod as well. So I think they're brewing low eighties. I'm going to try and brew a V60 of this coffee, and then the machine can brew, and we'll see, how much does the extraction vary? How much does the taste vary? How much is the technology doing? Looking at this, it's really not blooming very much. There's very little CO2 in here, and the more I think about it, the less I believe that the foam from this machine is caused by CO2. It would seem possible, perhaps even likely, that it's sort of foaming it with air rather than CO2 from the coffee. Let's get this brewing. Hey! So we've got both our beverages. Now, I made this one with the V60. The machine made this one, obviously. They're the same recipes. Brew time's almost identical too. So, 13 in, a total of 230 grams out. We know this one is going to be about 1.33% strength, because the other ones were. So, if we measure this, we'll know, have I done a comparable job of extraction? Okay, so some big differences here. This one is 0.1% lower in terms of strength. If you reverse the calculation for extraction, that's about 2% less extraction. So, clearly the machine, the spinny spinny, has given us a bump in extraction. Now, I'll taste them in a second. This is not really a filtered beverage, right? Like, there's no paper filtration here. This is sort of bed filtration happening. It seems to be pretty effective, but I expect the texture to be notably different to the paper-filtered coffee. Let's start with a benchmark. Quite a lot of texture, a ton of bitterness, no acidity, really. I wouldn't say much in the way of sweetness in terms of what I think coffee is capable of in terms of sweetness, but the texture is quite nice. I'll give it that. It's got some texture, but let's compare it to the V60. It's mostly worse, but in some ways, a little bit better. It really misses that texture from both the additional strength, and also from being paper-filtered in comparison to not paper-filtered, and it felt like that texture was good because it sort of distracted you from the bitterness that is kind of a little clearer here. That is actually less bitter, more texture. One-nil to the machine. That's definitely a machine win. So, now, I want to go machine versus machine, and for this, well, it might be complicated, but I think it can be done. I'm going to program my Decent to try and match the flow rate of these capsules. I'm going to program it to do a similar kind of pre-infusion, which might be a mistake, but we'll see, and then to try and hit that same 2.7, 2.8 grams of liquid a second, until we get to 230 grams of beverage, Let's see what happens. So, here's the brew from the Decent. It was really interesting, quite easy to dial in, because you can dial in by flow, and it turns out you didn't need much pressure to have the kind of flow that we need through that compacted bed of coffee. I'm going to measure the extraction of this while we brew a comparative version on this. We have an identical strength, 1.33, once again. Same beverage mass out, same dose of coffee in, very similar brew time, same flow rates through this. This was pulling at like half a bar, so in the patent, they talk about relatively low pressures. That does seem to be the case. How do they taste? Now, another advantage here in the comparison for the Decent is that, like this, it's not paper-filtered. It's, I suppose, metal-filtered. So you'd expect more texture, more body from the Decent. Really interesting, flavor, very comparable. I brewed the Decent at 82 Celsius through the whole shot, which I think is close to this. Flavor-wise, they're really similar, but obviously, the texture is different. This feels fluffier, unsurprisingly. That coffee foam is adding texture in a really interesting way. These were brewed identically. They were extracted identically. Why does this have all of this foam? What is this doing to make foam? I am more convinced than ever that this is aerated coffee foam, right? Like, if I get a blender and I put this in a blender and I blend it, I'll get some aerated coffee foam too. I should get a blender. Oh yeah, look at my crema. Not so special now, Nespresso. Look at it. I mean, this is not necessarily an accusation, because clearly, like, it's not like, \"aha, I gotcha.\" Though, I gotcha, but I mean, look at it. The whole spinning thing is doing something like this to the coffee, and does it change the texture?  Hmm, it does. It does. I would find these very hard to tell apart now. The quality of foam as it breaks down doesn't look like crema when it breaks down, but neither does this. In summary, I don't think the Nespresso Vertuo system is doing anything particularly unusual in terms of extraction, right? Water is going through coffee at a kind of flow rate, at a relatively low pressure, and it's extracting pretty well, and you can mimic that and get very similar results at similar brew temperatures with similar flow rates and pressures. That spinny system is hard to replicate. It's about locking you as a consumer or a customer in. This whole technology is around locking you in, not letting you buy coffee from anywhere else, making sure that you're spending your hundreds of pounds or dollars or euros or anything a year with them and no one else, and yeah, they're trying to offer you an unusual beverage in terms of a foamy filter coffee, and it does taste pleasant, but it's not special in terms of extraction. That coffee can be brewed other ways.", "videoID": "pO06RC4pvr0"}, {"title": "Espresso Drinks Explained\uff1a Histories, Recipes and More\u2026", "text": "Welcome to another episode in the Beginner's Guide to Coffee, and today we're covering espresso-based drinks. Now, that doesn't mean I'm gonna give you an exact recipe for all of the 15 different drinks that we're gonna cover. That would take a really, really, really long time. Instead, I'm gonna give you a little bit of a history, the kind of idea behind the drink, so that you know what to order, what you might expect when you do, and what you might want to make at home. So, first on the list, let's talk about espresso. Espresso is now incredibly difficult to actually define. It is basically a small, strong coffee brewed under pressure, typically topped with a red-brown foam called crema. That seems a little wishy-washy, but there's loads of different ways to make espresso these days. Now, the Italian National Espresso Institute, which of course exists, and I'm very happy it does, does have a very precise definition for Italian espresso, and I'll show that to you here. When you talk about espresso, especially online, there's a bit of a confusion between what is a single and what is a double, because here we've got, say, seven grams of coffee for a single espresso, but often you'll see recipes for 14, 18, 16, 20 grams of coffee. That's because they're brewing inside a double basket and not a single basket, so they're basically brewing two shots of espresso, a double espresso. Now, you'll see Italian espresso talks about milliliters in the cup, that's a volume measurement, whereas modern espresso talks about grams in the cup. And if you have grams in the cup, and how many grams of coffee that you used, you have what are called ratios, so the ratio between ground coffee and liquid coffee. A traditional espresso is in the one-to-two, to one-to-three range, right? So that's how much liquid you typically produce in around 25 to 30 seconds, typically under, say, six to nine bars of pressure at a brew temperature between 88 and probably 96, 97 degrees Celsius. I don't want to be overly prescriptive about what it is, because it can and should be lots of different things, but that ratio will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect from a traditional espresso. And as I said, modern coffee shops typically serve you a double espresso as standard. Traditional coffee shops will typically serve you a single espresso as standard. Another quick note, if you're in Italy, you'll probably notice that no one really orders an espresso at the bar. They say, un caffe, right? They just say, a coffee. That is the default way of brewing coffee in Italy, so if you order a coffee, you get espresso. A common variation on an espresso is a ristretto. That name means restricted, and the flow is restricted, and the idea is from the same amount of ground coffee, you get less liquid. And that liquid will be more intense, thicker, oozier, more kind of textured than a normal espresso. The easy way to do that is just to cut the shot short and let less liquid flow through the coffee. The better way to do it is to grind a little finer so the whole flow is slower, and you're able to properly extract the coffee using less water. But in terms of ratios, a ristretto would be, say, one-to-one, or, say, one-to-one-and-a-half. That would be broadly speaking the definition of a ristretto. Increasingly popular in modern coffee shops is the lungo. It just means a long coffee. Here, the ratio is much higher. Typically, it's not just the case of pushing more water through the same puck that you would brew an espresso with. Here, you'd be grinding coarser and allowing a lot more liquid to flow in a kind of similar brew time. Here, the ratio might be, say, one-to-three, up to one-to-five, one-to-six, and that's kind of the limits, really, of a traditional lungo. Next up is espresso con panna. Now this is a drink more commonly seen outside of Italy than inside of Italy. It's not a traditional drink necessarily. Here, it's just an espresso topped with a little whipped cream or double cream. It's also more commonly seen served with darker roasts, where you'd want to buffer a bit of that bitterness with the cream. It's not typically served with lighter roasted, more modern style specialty coffees. The macchiato is a complicated drink these days, but it shouldn't be. The name means marked or stained, and I think its history most likely goes back to a traditional espresso bar in Italy. There, lots of coffees would be served. You'd kind of order your drink, pick up something that was served on the bar sort of separately. Here, if you wanted just a little bit of milk in your espresso, which is kind of what the drink is, then that would happen. But, because of the crema on an espresso, if you pour just a little milk into a drink, you can't necessarily tell which one has just a splash of milk in it. So in order to tell which one was which, the barista would grab that jug of milk, grab a little teaspoon of foam, and dot the one that had a little milk in it with a dot of foam on top. So that way, when you walked up to the bar, you could see easily which one had a little milk in it. This was how it was served for a long time, until really latte art became incredibly popular. And at that point, a macchiato became an entirely different drink because baristas wanted to flex a little bit and pour nice-looking patterns in espresso cups, because it's hard to do and it looks quite cool. So the drink has more recently shifted, and a modern macchiato is a kind of one-to-one of espresso and milk, steamed milk with a thin layer of foam on top. However, we should mention the caramel macchiato, which Starbucks has used to confuse almost everyone, where you have a kind of latte drizzled or marked with caramel, and I think that has caused a great deal of confusion over the last 10 or 15 years in many, many coffee shops. Espresso romano, Roman espresso, I guess, is served very simply. It is a shot of espresso with some lemon in some form. Now, you see it served either as a twist of lemon or as a little slice of lemon. I would say with lighter, kind of modern specialty coffees, I would avoid the lemon slice, and I would go for a lemon twist because you're adding quite a lot of acidity to an already quite acidic beverage. But with a darker roast, that little lemon slice might contribute just a little lift in acidity and be really quite pleasant. The cortado is another drink that's gotten a little bit confusing. It is historically speaking a Spanish or Portuguese drink. It's most commonly seen there, and it is a one-to-one of espresso and steamed milk. These days, it's become a little bit like the sort of macchiato in that it's a full cup, so the barista can pour latte art, and it can be anywhere from a one-to-one ratio of coffee to milk, to a one-to-three, in some cases two. This is definitely a drink where the modern specialty shop and the traditional style one are quite a long way apart, and there's a huge amount of variance in the strength or size of drinks that you will receive, especially in modern coffee shops. In a very similar vein is the Piccolo latte. The name, despite being an Italian name, probably doesn't originate in Italy itself. It was probably Italianized outside of Italy because it's not a drink you really ever see there. It's a smaller latte. Typically, it's a single shot of espresso, and the ratio is one-to-two, to maybe one-to-three, sometimes one-to-four. It crosses over with the cortado in many specialty coffee shops, where one shop's cortado is identical to another shop's Piccolo. That can be a little bit confusing, but that's roughly the idea behind it. It's a small latte. The story you most often hear about the Americano is that after World War Two, American soldiers stationed in Italy couldn't handle espresso, and so had asked for it to be watered down a little bit to be more like American coffee, and thus was born the Americano. It's probably not true. Modern espresso wasn't really invented until 1948 and took a couple of years to really gain popularity after that. Ultimately, the idea is right, though. This is a way of making espresso close to American style filtered coffee in strength. And to do that, you use hot water to dilute down the espresso. These days, that ratio will go from anywhere from one-to-three, to one-to-four, to one-to-five. It's pretty open in that regard. And typically a specialty shop will put the hot water in the cup first and pour the espresso on top. The order you do them in doesn't actually make any real difference. It just looks much prettier to do water first and then coffee on top. No, the long black is a little bit different to an Americano because of the culture that it came from. This is a drink that came out of Australia and New Zealand, and as that culture spread, as that style of espresso brewing spread, they were brewing a lot of up-dosed, so a lot of coffee in the portafilter, ristretto-style espressos, and that was being used in a long black. So it's a little different from an Americano because traditionally, typically, it's a double ristretto on top of hot water. It's a stronger, slightly more textured drink than an Americano, but often there's not all that much difference in it. The cappuccino is super interesting to me because it has such an interesting history. In fact, I made a whole video about this history, but ultimately the drink predates espresso. It goes all the way back to Vienna, and it was called a kapuziner. And here, you used coffee and milk and you mixed them to the color of the Capuchin monks' robes. That was how you described how milky, how strong, you wanted your coffee. Since then, it's changed a great deal, and a modern cappuccino is defined in a couple of ways. Firstly, it should be a relatively strong drink. You might see a ratio of one-to-three, to one-to-five in terms of espresso to milk, and it should have a thick layer of foam on top. Ideally, that foam should be micro foam, where bubbles so small that you can barely see them, and it's a delicious, lovely drink. Now, there is the old rule of thirds for a cappuccino that doesn't really make any sense, that is one part espresso, one part steamed milk, and one part milk foam. Now, that means if you had a single shot of Italian espresso at 25 mils, then your single-shot cappuccino would be a 75 mil drink, which it's not. So the caffe latte is interesting. It's another drink that evolved I think outside of Italy, despite having an Italian name. You don't really see it very often in Italy. Its history or its roots might be something like the cafe au lait, the French drink where you'd have quite strong coffee and equal parts of that and hot milk, often served in a bowl. Dip a little pastry in there, very delicious. But the caffe latte, the modern caffe latte, is defined by being a relatively weak drink. The ratio of milk to coffee is a little bit higher and it will have some foam on the drink, but not a lot. This means it's very popular for people who like a sweeter, milkier thing, and popular with baristas who can pour really nice latte art into it. Ratio wise, it will vary quite a lot. It can go from, say, one-to-four, up to one-to-six, in some cases. Often it's served as a larger drink with a double shot in the base. The history of the flat white is extremely contentious. Those from Australia argue that it's Australian, those from New Zealand would say it's from New Zealand. It most likely originated as a kind of pushback against the big, awful, dry, sea foamy cappuccino of the 1990s. People didn't want a cup that was mostly air. They just wanted a flat, white coffee. That was it. Just give me not the big foamy thing, but a milky coffee. And these days a flat white is very common, especially in Europe, especially in the UK, actually, in a lot of specialty shops. It would be defined as a small, strong latte in that it's typically a double shot drink in say a five or six ounce cup, or 150 to 180 mil cup, with the textured milk similar to a latte, so a thin layer of foam on top. Again, commonly poured with latte art because you've got that really thin, silky texture of milk that lets you pour quite intricate, delicate patterns with it. While it has been adopted by some larger chain coffee companies, if you see it in a specialty independent shop, chances are there's a bit of an Antipodean influence there, and you'll probably get pretty good coffee. Caffe corretto is a kind of great name for this drink. It means a corrected coffee, and it's corrected by adding some booze to it. This is often served as an espresso with a little booze on the side. Sometimes the booze is in the coffee already, but what I most commonly see, especially in Italy, is that people will drink the espresso, nearly finish it, and then throw in the booze, swirl it around and sort of capture the last of the coffee and mix it with the alcohol and drink it that way. As for alcohol, most often it's seen with grappa, sometimes sambuca, occasionally cognac if someone's feeling fancy, but those would be the main types of booze that you'd see in a caffe corretto. Historically, the word mocha kind of existed in around coffee when it was referencing the Port of Mocha in Yemen. Coffee from that part of the world was often labeled as mocha, and what became popular at one point in the industry were mocha java blends, theoretically blends of coffees from Yemen with coffees from Java. Now, this became a kind of stylistic thing, a kind of idea rather than a traceability thing, and people began to put other coffees in their mocha java blends, just to aim for that kind of chocolatey-er, heavier taste profile. How that connects to a hot chocolate with some espresso in it, I don't really know, but that seems to be the kind of rough source of the link. As for the drink itself, it really is pretty variable out there how it's done. People might use sort of couverture, sort of melted chocolate. They might use a chocolate syrup. There are no hard and fast rules. You might even see powdered chocolate in there in some cafes, too. It is ultimately a hot chocolate with a single or double shot of espresso, but there's really very little in the way of rules around what a mocha is. In some cases, it might have some whipped cream on top. Ultimately, you do you. Now, there are a few slightly weirder drinks that I just want to touch on quickly.

So the red eye is really a drink that I've only ever seen in North America, and it obviously references someone being extremely tired the same way you might take a red eye flight overnight and, you know, arrive first thing in the morning and feel pretty terrible and need some coffee to pick you up. It's basically a filtered coffee with an espresso dropped in it, just to give it some more strength and more caffeine. Personally, I would separate the two and enjoy an espresso, and then take my filtered coffee with me. But, if you're in a hurry, I guess just throw it all together, have some fun. Now, the breve latte is another kind of variation that I typically only see in North America. It refers to a caffe latte. Instead of using milk, you're using half and half, which if you're not familiar with it, is half whole milk and half single cream, so a notably higher fat content than whole milk. That's basically it. It's the same ratios as you'd aim for, I guess the same texture, though half and half won't foam identically to whole milk, so you'll have a slight variance in sort of foam texture there. It is a milky, kind of fattier, richer version of a caffe latte. Last up, I want to talk about the gibraltar. Now, this is actually quite a popular drink, but quite a confusing drink. It originates most likely in San Francisco, most likely in Blue Bottle. It's a drink that's named after the name of the glass made by a company called Libbey. They make a particular glass called the Gibraltar glass, and if you had coffee and milk in that, it was a kind of one-to-two kind of ratio drink. It was quite a strong milk drink with a little bit of foam on top. That was a gibraltar, and that's kind of gotten out, and it's not always served in a Libbey-made Gibraltar glass, but that's roughly the idea behind it. This happens once in a blue moon, where a cafe kind of names a drink and it kind of leaks out into the rest of the world. It's kind of interesting. Ultimately, if you're ordering a gibraltar somewhere else, you're really probably ordering a Piccolo latte or a cortado in some places, too. It's really within that kind of family of drinks, but it did seem worth mentioning in this video. But now I really wanna hear from you down in the comments below.", "videoID": "93waR1jzoLA"}, {"title": "Espresso Tonic - From Scratch", "text": "Today, we're talking about this, the espresso tonic. Now this is a drink, has made people feel a whole bunch of different ways. It's made journalists who don't do good journalism go, ah, how disgusting, how hipster, who could possibly want a bitter coffee and bitter tonic? But it has made the coffee industry, the specialty coffee industry as a whole pretty excited. It's a fun, easy to make drink. You can serve in cafes, it's great for summer. Today we're gonna look at it in a bit more detail. We're gonna make our own version from scratch to see what we can learn as we chase the ultimate espresso tonic. In terms of history, this was certainly put on the cultural map, the first person I heard about doing this was Anne Lunell, at Koppi Coffee in Sweden, fantastic coffee roasters you should definitely check out. I don't know if they can claim to have invented it, or someone at their staff party claimed to invent it, but they popularized it. People in the coffee industry saw it served there, tasted it, picked it up, put it on menus, and it spread around the world. It's really down to ingredients. You're gonna need good tonic, and good espresso, and a lot of ice. Don't get the Schweppes out for this one. Seriously, don't drink Schweppes tonic. There's just so many more delicious tonics in the world than Schweppes, so sorry Schweppes, but no. Here, we've gone pretty traditional. It's a good single origin espresso. It's a Fever-Tree, Indian tonic water. And the result-- Is pretty good. You get like a little tickle of coffee, some nice citrus kind of botanicals come through. Definitely some citric acid in here. And the coffee's bitterness is almost switched off by the presence of the tonic's bitterness. You get that nice little tonic bite in there. It's not overwhelming, but it's very pleasant. But considering it's espresso on ice, it's not particularly bitter. Now certainly a darker roast coffee is gonna taste much more bitter in this drink. And I think this certainly suits light to medium espresso style roasts better than it suits darker espresso roasts. But your mileage may vary, it's up to you what you like. Mm. The sugar from that tonic syrup is present but it's not overwhelmingly sweet. It's really nicely balanced. Overall it's a good drink. You can taste the coffee, it's complimented well by the tonic. But can we do better? Can we do better? That's the question. And to start with, well we're gonna have to make some tonic syrup. A lot of credit for this episode is gonna go to Dave Arnold in New York. He's a chef, mixologist, kind of bartender-y, but not, but he's a chef, but he's a food scientist, but he's a podcaster, and an author. And you should just check out Cooking Issues as a podcast and you'll have a good time. Maybe give it a couple episodes just to settle in. Now his book, \"Liquid Intelligence\", contains a phenomenal gin and tonic recipe, and we're gonna take that all the way back to the beginning, which starts with a cinchona bark syrup. That's our base of our tonic. And I just wanna taste that, pure and neutral against coffee, and see where we go from there. Now we have some advantages, in that I have a bunch of CO2 here in the studio so I can carbonate things as I go. I don't need to go and buy sparkling water. And we can look at carbonating with and without coffee in the mix. So let's get on and make some syrup. So to make the syrup I'm using Dave Arnold's recipe, and I'm gonna do a half batch. I'm gonna take 10 grams of cinchona bark chips. I'm gonna grind them in a hand grinder down to a fine powder. I'm gonna add that to 375 grams of water. Combine them in a little sauce pan, bring them to the boil and leave them to simmer for five minutes. Let it cool down and then strain it through a strainer, and then strain it again through a coffee filter. Here I'm gonna use a V60 filter. And you'll end up with a pretty clear looking liquid. Check the weight of the liquid, and top it up with water back to 375 grams of weight. Now we're gonna take 375 grams of sugar and combine it with the cinchona infusion to create a very simple cinchona syrup. That's gonna be the basis of our tonic water. So we're back, and here's where things get really interesting. Here we've got the Fever-Tree tonic, 140 grams of that. Here we've got the homemade tonic, slightly different color from the cinchona bark. What this is gonna do is super interesting. By comparing and contrasting one, I'll be able to tell what kind of sugar levels I'm aiming for. I know exactly how much sugar is in here so if it's as sweet, too sweet, not as sweet as this, I've got some idea of where the sugar level in commercial tonic is, that's good. Secondly, this has a lot more aromatics and botanicals in it, this does not. When you taste two things like this side-by-side, you'll start to ignore what they have in common and only really taste the differences between them. So it should amplify what's in here that I like or maybe don't like, and might wanna change for a final recipe over here. This does contain one more thing, an acidulant. Now I'm recreating according to Dave Arnold's recipe lime juice with none of limes flavor. Essentially it's a 6% acid concentration split between citric and malic acid. Those are the two primary acids in lime juice. In addition, that would be succinic acid in lime juice, but we're not gonna use that 'cause it's harder to get, and I don't think necessarily all that useful for what we wanna do in general. But enough talk, let's get on with some tasting. So let's start with the Fever-Tree again. Very pleasant. Really quite dominant citrus botanicals in there, which is interesting. Let's taste this without those. Hmm. That is interesting to taste. A little bit more acid than in here. So I know that I need to use a little bit less acid when it comes to my preferred recipe. In truth, I don't think it's as sweet as this one over here is, so I might use a little bit more syrup in my recipe. And what's really nice is that I can taste the cinchona bark. I can taste that sort of tonic syrup in there quite clearly. And it's still doing that thing where it kind of negates the bitterness of coffee, or at least compliments it in a way that is extremely pleasant. Going back to this, it's like Sprite, it's lemons and limes. It's all you really taste, really heavy on those. Now with coffee, personally I like orange as a botanical more than I perhaps like lemon or lime. So what I'm thinking here is that I definitely wanna have some citrus in this drink. I think it's a really nice aspect of this one that I definitely wanna recreate. But I think I might go oranges and lemons, a little bit softer and warmer, and let that coffee still have room to be itself. I think it's gonna be really easy to be a little bit heavy handed with the citrus in this, and have it just be quite dominant over the coffee, and that would be a terrible mistake. And now I need a bit more tonic syrup in there as a ratio. So I'm gonna up that in this next batch. And I know I need a little bit less acid. This is a little acid heavy. It's like you've dosed lime juice into tonic water. You need some acid, and you'll find typically citric acid only used in here. There is something pleasant about the malic acid addition in this one, it's just a little bit dominant for me. First thing I'll do is essentially halve it in the next round. So here's the plan. I'm gonna do half the acidulant in here, half the sort of lime acid in this version, and 20% more syrup, that might be a bit heavy. But I will try it, I think 20% is about right. In addition, I'm gonna get some orange zest, and some lemon zest, I'm gonna infuse it into the tonic water before carbonation, see if I can give it a little bit more of that kind of citrus kick, and then we'll make another round. Very exciting times. So again, classic Fever-Tree over here, it's from freshly carbonated citrus additional, slightly sweeter, slightly less acidic, homemade syrup over here. Let's have a taste. Set the standard, set the benchmark for today. Interesting. Now the advantage I have here doing it this way is freshness. I freshly zested an orange and a lemon, half a gram of each into my batch of tonic water, which is about 300 mils total as a sort of single small batch. Very present from a very short infusion maybe two minutes under pressure, but very pretty. Now interestingly I would say, we're actually a little less sweet still over here than we are over here, also a little less acidic. But there's a bit more cinchona kick in this than this one here. So I need more syrup, which is interesting, and relatively easy to do in a batch. The aromatics are very enjoyable. Very pretty when they're kinda fresh that way. Maybe it's additional sweetness, but there's almost a sort of suggestion of vanilla in here. God, that's a that's a pretentious sentence isn't it? A suggestion of vanilla. We're getting pretty comparable, if not more delicious than one of the best tonics you can buy on the planet. It's reassuring. But again, we're trying to build this to work with coffee rather than to work with gin. I'm not gonna try and enter the tonic business anytime soon. It's a bit crowded these days. But, enjoyable. Now the one other topic that I do wanna address in this video is carbonation. Now, Dave Arnold in his gin and tonic recipe is pretty obsessed with carbonation. And so for that reason, he's making a kind of clarified lime juice, or replicating lime juice just by building it out of water and acids, because he doesn't want any pieces of lime in the drink, because those will act as nucleation points. Those will cause the CO2 to come out a solution. And the reason that gin and tonics are never as carbonated as you want them to be is one, presence of lime juice and two, presence of ice. So what I'm interested in is essentially carbonating a very cold finished drink and trying that. So what we're gonna do is this, we're gonna pull our shot of espresso, and we're going to strain it through paper to get rid of any sort of particulate matter inside it, anything suspended in there. Anything that would create a nucleation point. And then we're gonna combine that with our tonic syrup, touch of saline, with a little bit of our acidulant, and with some water, and then we're gonna carbonate and chill that down. That way we should get maximum crisp fizziness. We should be able to serve it nice and cold without needing ice in the glass which would cause the fizz to kind of disappear, and the drink to go flat quickly. And we should be able to have a crisp, acidic, bubbly, delicious, citrusy coffee flavored espresso tonic. Let's give that a go. So here we are, we now have an ice cold glass. We have some espresso tonic that has been chilled, carbonated, and is ready to go. Now, to get the sort of citrus levels that I wanted I kind of had to go back to the beginning and infuse it into the syrup itself. That way I could use a good amount of citrus and it be well distributed across the whole syrup. So, it makes life a little easier that way. This espresso has some foaming agents I'm gonna be a little bit careful with this when we're pouring. So here it is, espresso tonic from scratch. That is delicious. The texture on that is really nice. That syrupyness is there, the acid is really nice, the sweetness is not overwhelming. It's really sort of squashed down the bitterness. Just a little citrus aromatic to make it complex and fun. You don't have to go the whole hog. You don't have to lose your mind and carbonate everything. Though having no ice in there gives it an extra tickle of carbonation. Like it's really good. Mm. I've had quite a lot of coffee so far and I wanna keep drinking this. This is really super good. The thing for me, the lesson here is one, this recipe is delicious and I'll make sure it's on my website, which I'll talk about in a second. But two, this was really easy. You have the one ingredient that's a little bit tricky to get, but a Google search will get you there. But as a process to make a drink like this from scratch, to make something as good as is available commercially but have so much more flexibility. You can tune this into your coffee. Whether you're a cafe or you're at home, you could build a custom tonic around a particular coffee really easily. This is just like an Ecuadorian single estate coffee, it's really delicious, it's got a kind of milk chocolate through a slight peachiness here. And so it works really well with just a little lemon and orange in there. But if you're using a Kenyan coffee, you could get away with using lemon grass, or some pink peppercorns, or some other interesting botanicals in your tonic mix. So they're there, and they're subtle, and they're interesting, but it is delicious. The full recipe, the whole breakdown, the techniques, all of that kind of stuff, including guidance on when and where you might wanna add different botanicals. Well, that's on my website.

If you do that all the time, if you've got a cafe or somewhere like that, that does this as a standard, I'd love to see what you're doing differently to what I was doing.", "videoID": "4x92J4gQwzM"}, {"title": "Weird Coffee Science\uff1a Hacking Sour Espresso", "text": "All around us are the products of modern chemistry. Drinking coffee is one of life's a pleasures, a pleasure that cannot be duplicated by any other beverage. Welcome to this episode of Weird Coffee Science. And today we're gonna be messing around and having some fun with \"the buffer.\" To explain this, I'm gonna have to talk to you about water chemistry in relation to coffee brewing. And lots of you are hoping that this is gonna be that video. The one that explains everything, the one that says, which is the right sort of water chemistry for the best tasting coffee, this is not that video. I am gonna talk to you about a couple of key aspects of water chemistry though. But before we begin, I do need to shout out Scott Rio, this is ultimately his idea. He mentioned this kind of big idea to me when he was in London and it's nagged at the back of my brain and I wanted to try it. And I thought this was the perfect opportunity. So let's talk water chemistry. And I'm gonna do it in a way that I hope is simple enough that if you don't care that much, it still makes sense. And if you do care, you don't feel like I'm basically lying to you. Now for a long time, we talked about TDS in water and that's, Total Dissolved Solids. And if you look at say the back of a bottle of mineral water, you'll be able to see what kind of minerals are dissolved in that water. Now, TDS is easy to measure. You can buy a cheap TDS meter, it'll tell you how much stuff is in the water. And we use that for a long time to kind of tune our recipes and tune our water treatment. But people like Maxwell Colonna Dashwood were pretty vocal in saying TDS is kind of useless. It tells you that there's lots of stuff in there but not what makes it up and really to massively oversimplify, there are two big categories of things when it comes to coffee that are important. The first are the minerals. Things like calcium, things like magnesium. These are necessary to help extract coffee flavor; too much can be bad, but not enough can be bad as well. With calcium and magnesium, they each get involved in slightly different reactions. So having a load of calcium will produce a brew that tastes quite different to having a load of magnesium. We're not gonna get too deep into that today. The other key aspect of water chemistry is what's called the buffer, the alkalinity of the water. Buffering compounds when they go into solution, produce both a weak acid and a weak base in that solution, right? So if you add an acid to them, that base reacts with that acid and it neutralizes it. That way, your PH doesn't move too much if you add an acid to a buffered solution. Now things like your blood have a ton of buffer in them because of the pH of your blood moves much at all, you're dead, that's very bad. Now, in water bicarbonate, acts as the buffering kind of compound here. So you'll see a correlation between the level of bicarbonate and its alkalinity, it's buffering potential. If you took a filter coffee and you had a ton of buffer in that water, you'd mute out a lot of interesting flavors. It would be very boring. Now, most of the time that we talk about brewing water for coffee, we're often talking about filter coffee. Now the strength of filter coffee is usually between let's say 1.3 to 1.5%. That's how much of that coffee is dissolved coffee and the rest of the 98.7 to the 98.5, that's just water. Filter coffee is not particularly strong at all. Now espresso, well, that has a much higher concentration. At that point, you're looking at maybe eight through 10, even 12% strength. Scott's suggestion was what if the amount of buffer correlated to the strength of the beverage, right? Having the right amount of buffer for filter coffee, well, that might not be the right amount of buffer for espresso. What if you had, let's say seven times more buffer in your espresso, what would happen? Would that moderate the acidity of a super light roast, a kind of filter coffee roast that when you brew it as espresso is just brutally dominantly, unpleasantly acidic. So what we're gonna do is this, we're gonna take a coffee. We're gonna take a Kenyan coffee that was roasted for filter drinking, and we're gonna make some espresso with it. That's gonna be our benchmark because we can extract that but that end result as an espresso may not taste that good. Let's start by getting an espresso machine. Let's start by dialing it in with just some nice brewing water and pulling shots of this light roast filter roast kind of coffee, and seeing how that tastes. What we're gonna do here to start off with, is take some reasonably be normal brewing water. It's relatively low in both minerals and actually relatively low in buffer but that's okay because I actually want a benchmark of what will be a very acidic espresso. I'm gonna dose 20 grams into this machine. I'm gonna pull 40 grams out in around 28, 30 seconds. There should be a lot, a lot of acidity in the cup which is what we want for this experiment. I need some espresso. We've got the all-important teaspoon, we can give this espresso a little stir. Ooh, that's got a lot of acidity. That's got a lot of acidity in it. This is exactly what I wanted to explore. This is a great benchmark. So this, there's a ton of origin characteristics here. I can taste the coffee that went in there. There is a ton of sweetness in this, but my, oh, my, this is sour. So, wow. So onto our first experiment. So what I've done and you just have trust me on this, 'cause I can't actually prove it to you is I've changed the water inside this machine's tank. And we've gone to a very high alkalinity water. It's like 350 milligrams per liter alkalinity which is about seven times more than you would have in say good brewing water. The question is, if you're going at much higher concentrations, if the concentration of espresso is seven times higher than that a filter ish, does a seven times higher alkalinity give you balance wherein you would usually struggle? There's only one way to find out. We have to make more delicious espresso. So same thing, 20 grams of coffee in 40-ish, grams of coffee out and around about 30 seconds. That's our benchmark let's make it happen. Looks good. Acids definitely there, but it doesn't hurt my face. Still maybe a touch more acid that I might want. And a little harsh, little harsh, not bad, not bad, better than before. No, no physical pain as before. Now, that's definitely interesting, but there is one big problem. High levels of bicarbonate coupled with a reasonably high levels of minerals, coupled with a hot environment equals limescale. So this kind of water is much, much much more likely to scale up a machine and cause you problems. At this point, there's something interesting here, but I'm not sure I'd recommend brewing with high alkalinity water. There is one more idea to discuss, but before we do that, I just need to tell you about this video sponsor which is Squarespace.

Thanks so much to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. Now I did have a second experiment in mind. What I wanted to do was brew that original, that kind of benchmark espresso, but add the alkalinity in afterwards. You see alkalinity is gonna affect the extract of coffee, right? It's gonna affect the liquid. It's gonna affect the pH of that liquid. It can affect it if you add it into the machine but there's no real reason that you couldn't just add it into the cup and still have that buffering effect on the acidity of the cup. Now you're gonna need a lot more bicarb here, like a lot more. So I've made up a solution just using the sodium bicarbonate. So this is 2000 milligrams per liter of alkalinity, that's a lot. So what we should be able to do is just add maybe five grams of that water slowly dilute our espresso but then add a bunch of buffer to that drink to see if it kind of mops up some acidity. So what we're gonna need to do of course, is to brew another espresso. And give it a little taste just to give myself a benchmark. Yup, yup, that's still, that's still very sour. So I have my super high alkalinity water here and I'm gonna add maybe five grams. So does this work? Yes, yes it does. There's still tons of acid here. Like there's still an overwhelming level of acidity in the coffee that the buffer, five grams of this buffer isn't gonna kind of mop it all up. But goodness me, that's an interesting change. Now I'm trynna work out, if it's in other ways, changing or messing with my perception of the coffee. I feel like there's been a textural change here. I know we need to do this double-blind and there's some flaws here, but there's no question that has changed the experience of this coffee. It is more enjoyable to drink. I don't know what this means. I know that coffee science is weird. I think we've got something kind of cool here. I think we've got something really fun and definitely something that you at home can play with. Get some bicarbonate of soda. And it's important that you get bicarbonate of soda. Don't get baking powder that has other stuff you want bicarbonate of soda, sodium bicarbonate. That's what you want. It's cheap, it's everywhere, it's in every grocery store. Get some, you probably have some already. Dissolve it in water. I used about 3.2 grams per liter to produce a water that had about 2000 milligrams per liter of alkalinity. Now you could probably double that actually and be able to then use less in your espresso but this is so easy to do. And I think you should totally do it. The potential is kind of interesting here. I'd be really interested to hear if you don't like this. The point here is that you could have like a little drop a bottle of water that has a super high alkalinity. And if you pull a shot, that's well extracted but just that little bit too acidic, one drop, two drops, three drops, a gram, two grams, maybe that rounds it out, maybe that cleans it up. Maybe you don't lose any origin characteristics. Maybe you keep everything you like. You know, historically we used sugar to fix acidity, right? If you take lemon juice, if you add sugar to it, it becomes pleasant. The pH doesn't change, but the perceived acidity does. Here, we're messing with the pH and it changes the kind of acidity in a different way than sugar does, right? But it doesn't skew things, it doesn't obscure things in the same way. It's super interesting. I want you to try it and tell me why this is a bad idea. Tell me why this is stupid.", "videoID": "jtCbIbi2dHI"}, {"title": "Better than Brad\uff1f I remade Brad Pitt's Coffee Commercial", "text": "Today, we're remaking Brad Pitt's coffee commercial. And if I'm completely honest, things have gotten a little out of hand. - Let me explain how all this came to pass. Now you may be familiar with Fiverr. It's an enormous marketplace for kind of digital services. And they actually approached me and said \"Hey, do you know that we do a load for businesses and say you could crew a film shoot with people from Fiverr, with professionals from Fiverr\". And I didn't know that. And they said \"if we give you a budget, what would you make, if you had to make something beautiful?\" And I thought about it for a minute. And I thought, well, what about if we remade the Brad Pitt coffee commercial? And in that moment, that seemed like a fun thing to do. And I did not understand what an incredibly complex and enormous task I had signed up for. But, Fiverr said yes. Here's some budget, go and hire some people, go and make a thing. And that, is what we did. Now I did say, right at the start of this thing, that this shoot got a little bit out of hand. And if I'm honest, it did so in a number of different ways. Some more hilarious than others. Let me, or past me, explain in a bit more detail. Now we don't have a Pacific Coast highway in England. We, we have Beachy Head, which is where we are today. And when I say like we've got Beachy Head, we've got Beachy Head. Like we're gonna close the road to film on there. I didn't know that was allowed. I didn't think someone who makes like coffee YouTube videos was allowed to close roads. But apparently if you do the paperwork and you pay the sort of fees, yeah, you can close a road. And so we're gonna film with a tracking vehicle. Which is this big, old vehicle behind me over there. We're gonna film crew on there, you know, the bike, beautiful coastline. And that, I feel like, is an adequate substitute for the Pacific Coast highway. This feels like a lot. I don't know. I didn't think at any point in my career, this would be how my day would go. I will say that now, if you haven't seen the original Brad Pitt De'Longhi coffee commercial, now is a good time to watch it. There's a link down in the description. Or, if you wish for a layer of more entertainment, I made a video about it, kind of going through a kind of reaction to it, because it was such an incredibly entertaining video. And that's linked down in the description below. Watching that one will help when you watch my version of it, cause a few more things will make sense. Let's go back to what exactly I had committed to do. That Brad Pitt coffee commercial is directed by Damien Chazelle. He's a Oscar-winning Hollywood director. It's a Hollywood commercial, right? And I was like, I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna do it in just two days. And that's ambitious. And in fact, everyone I spoke to was like, 'this you would maybe wanna do as like a four day shoot'. And I was like, 'no, we're gonna do it as a two day shoot'. And that, it turned out, was doomed to failure. Obviously, we couldn't have the size of crew that the original sort of production had. And if you actually go and watch the behind the scenes of that, you can sort of see little snippets of kind of how much production went into that coffee commercial. And as well, you can see just how many Brad bags there were! There was like a staggering number of Brad bags. Back to how we crewed this thing. Now, if you wanna make a commercial, even at the smallest scale that we're kind of working at, then there are some really key roles that you needed to fill. And that's where Fiverr came in. So, I went to Fiverr to start looking for the kind of key roles for this. And usually, I direct a lot of the videos on this channel, I suppose. Seems a bit grand to call myself a director. But I would sort of fill that role here. With this project, I knew that I needed two key roles. One of which was director. And the other was DOP, director of photography. These two were gonna be absolutely crucial. And I feel like I really lucked out by finding Lightmill Media on Fiverr. Who are a director and DOP duo. And they were the first people I spoke to and started to work with and kind of built a relationship with. They were amazing to work with, I'll say that, throughout this. They were really great to work with, Ross and Chris, amazing, amazing people. So much fun. But we needed more crew. And so the next person you're gonna need is gonna be an AC, an assistant camera, or a first AC. And they're gonna do things like pull focus. Because you know, Ross might be holding the camera, Chris might be directing, someone else actually focuses the camera during the shot, to make sure everything looks really good. And helps out with kind of maintaining all the camera, doing all the kind of technical stuff alongside. We had a couple of different people, Nicola and Paige, both phenomenal people to find through Fiverr. And then we needed a gaffer. It's someone who's primarily concerned with lighting, controlling light. And so yeah, Ed did tremendous work. You can have all the fancy equipment and all the fancy lenses, but light is this massive deal to make things look good. And you can judge for yourself, just how good his work is. Again, with really really restricted time and kind of resource. Lastly, and kind of the key crew, is gonna be sound. Now, we added some more dialogue to this particular version of this thing. And in fact, well it was more than just me doing some talking. Somewhere here is a little cameo from a previous video you might remember. For all of the sound stuff, which wasn't just dialogue recording, but also a lot of the sounds that we captured during the shoot, we had Cam. Cam was amazing, again, to work with. Did a great job. We've got so much great sound from this thing. And sound is really, really, really super important when you're making videos. Especially if you want 'em to look and feel kind of special. This was the core crew that set out to do this ridiculous thing. We might have pulled it off. We might actually have pulled this off. Were it not for the outdoor film shoot's great natural nemesis, the British weather. Now, the way it worked is, actually we shot out of sequence. And the first day of shooting, we shot inside, all the kind of internal shots. And so that was the kind of apartment that I kind of lived in or all the kind of the nice house or the, I don't know what we call it. It was a really beautiful space and kind of fun to work in that. So welcome to a very hazy house, that will be my house for the day. Shooting some kitchen stuff over there, and we just might set a fire alarm off, but that's fine. But it's very hazy, it's very pretty. We also shot in Prufrock, which was our kind of cafe location that we needed to use. But the second day was kind of all the external stuff, all the kind of motorbike stuff, all of the kind of outdoors shots. And in, you know, it had been a summer, it had been the longest, hottest, driest summer I could remember. And we managed to find the one day of constant and unrelenting rain. So what you can see in the background, is a van being packed up because we can't shoot today. There's too much rain. It's not safe to ride the bike. It's not safe to do a tracking shot. At - at 25 past 10 in the morning of a full day, we are done. And this is where things started to get tricky. We needed to complete the shoot and it meant we needed to film for a third day, which means we had to hire everyone for a third day. We had to hire equipment for a third day. We had to get permitting for the third day. And in true Hollywood fashion, this meant we were way behind schedule and way over budget. It meant that the third day of shooting really, really, really, really had to go well. So this is the first location for the day. And we came here last time and it wasn't good. It was not good. Today, the weather has smiled upon us. It's beautiful day. We're in the middle of kind of nowhere, honestly. And that's kind of nice, filming the kind of rural retreat at which I live, which is not a kind of California thing. But, you'll see, it'll make sense. A bit late already this morning, a bit stressed. It's a lot to do today. I dunno how much we're gonna get done, but we'll find out. We have to get everything done. Oh, we gotta go. We've gotta go, okay. -  Get you on the bike? - I'm on the bike, okay. Now, if you've watched the original, you probably have some questions. Primarily around the motorbike. That commercial, it's a coffee commercial, is very motorbike centric. I should probably do some explaining on that front. I'm not gonna surprise you by saying, I know nothing about motorbikes. I don't own a motorbike. I know nothing. And so there was really just one choice. I had to call Brad. And so I called Brad. And Brad has been amazing. So generous with his time, his knowledge. Not only did Brad agree to lend a bike for this production, Brad agreed to come down and let his, you know, give us his hands-on expertise for the shoot. He's here, Brad. - Hello everybody. - This is Brad. He has a company called Dark Arts Coffee in London. Check 'em out, they're down below, and an amazing bike. Tell me about the bike. - The bike. It's a Harley Davidson. It's a chopper. -  Nice. -  It was built by a good friend of mine, Rene, who's got a place out in the Netherlands, called Just Fubar Motorcycles. But yeah. It's a big, fast. - Terrifying. - Powerful. - Terrifying. - Motorcycle. - Terrifying. - And I can't wait to see you on the back. This is gonna be fun. Are you ready? - No. Forgive me. But it had to be done. Anyway. We've filmed this whole thing, right? And we've got all the footage and I've cut it down. But that doesn't mean it's finished. Because if you want things to be truly professional, then we need two more things. We need a soundtrack. Because obviously we can't use the existing soundtrack. We don't have the license for that, and they're probably unlikely to grant it for a pastiche. And secondly, we need color grading. Because, you know, with a really nice camera, you'll capture loads of information and that lets you kind of set a feel and a style and a tone. And obviously we had a reference material here. We had a kind of reference look from that first commercial. But England is not California. And so again, the color grade needed to make the whole thing feel kind of coherent. And for both of those things, again, we turned to Fiverr. And again, you can find loads of really talented professionals on Fiverr to do this kind of work. And the results, well, I guess it is time to see the results, isn't it? It's not for De'Longhi, I should make that clear. It's just built upon the perfume ad that, you know, Brad and Damien made. But now it's time for me to stop talking and to show you the work that collectively we have made with the generous support of Fiverr. And honestly, I make coffee videos on YouTube. At no point that I think I would get to make something like this. After I show it to you, after this strange tribute to Brad Pitt's weird coffee commercial airs, I will talk through just a few of my favorite things from the whole experience, before we kind of wrap up. So, I'll be back with you in a little bit over a minute. I hope you enjoyed that. And if you've watched that and thought, well maybe I wanna hire some professionals through Fiverr, then do make sure you click the link in the description down below, or use code JamesHoffmann to get 10% off any of your orders you place through Fiverr. And I have to say thank you to them for agreeing to let me do something this completely bizarre and wonderful and fun. And I hope for you, it was a little bit of entertainment as well. For me, there were some highlights of the whole thing. It was just, it's the, you know, it's the biggest production that I've worked on like this, it's the most crew. And as a result, I learned a lot from it, right? That for me, it's just a constant learning experience. And that was amazing to get to work with people who have just way more skill in every aspect of what they do, than I do. And for me, that was a real, real pleasure. And I'm grateful to all of them. They were amazing. I have to say that there's this kind of weird memory I will always have, which is where we've closed Beachy Head and we're riding along and there's this big truck with like someone stuck on the top of it, in a slightly terrifying way, filming us. And I look across and there's like 20 or 30 people who are just visiting the area, who've just stopped. And they have no idea what's going on, but they're filming madly with their camera phones. They have no idea who I am or what this is. And it was just this weird, strange, glorious, singular moment that I will treasure in this strange way. Also, it was a weirdly animal-filled trip. I did not expect the range of animals that we experienced in this trip to be hanging out with us as we were trying to make a strange coffee commercial. But overall, I learned a ton. It was a lot of fun. I am very grateful again to Brad actually, shout out to Brad for being incredibly patient with all of this. And for riding around and just having some fun with it all too. A link to Dark Arts is down the description below. Go and check them out if you wanna do that.", "videoID": "W0hFEPPOGKI"}, {"title": "Stop Swirling Your Espresso", "text": "Today's video is gonna be a little weird. It's gonna get right down the rabbit hole of espresso, into the weird little details. Here's the deal. I think espresso tastes way better when you mix it, before you drink it. And here's why. When an espresso brews, the first liquid out of those spouts is incredibly thick, it's incredibly dense. That kind of sits at the bottom of the espresso cup, and as the brew progresses, less and less dense liquid is coming out and that layers on top of the first very dense layer, a bit like one of those trashy layered cocktails that thankfully, nobody makes anymore. If you just sip an unmixed espresso, that first sip will be mostly the last part of the shot. It'll be thinner, have less texture, less sweetness and you sip again, it gets a little bit better, then you sip again and maybe you finish it and you get just the super dense stuff at the start, sweeter but also much, much, much more acidic. So you get three evolving, interesting but ultimately unsatisfying sips of your coffee. Or mix it all together before you drink it and that way every single sip is balanced and delicious. Now I see a lot of people swirling their espresso before they drink it, to kind of mix it all together. The problem is, I don't think that works. I think it's way better when you stir it, over swirling it. And to be honest, every time I do a taste test, I feel the same way. But that's very subjective. Maybe there's an objective way to test my hypothesis, and I think there is. So here's what I did. So firstly, I was curious about the difference between stirring and doing nothing to an espresso. So I pulled two shots, I left one alone, stirred the other and I then pulled two or three mils of liquid from the very top of the cup of each one and I tested the strength. And there was a huge difference between the two, massive. The unstirred shot, that top layer was about 8% strength, the stirred shot was closer to 10% strength, like a massive difference in strength there. So then, having established that mixing is a thing that we should be doing, I then pulled a lot more shots. And each time I would take a pair, I would swirl one and stir the other, and do the same test where I pulled that little bit of liquid from the top of each cup, I'd strain it and test it with a Roth tactometer. If swirling was as good as stirring, then they should produce very similar results in terms of strength. But that isn't what happened. Every single time stirring, that top layer was stronger than in a swirled shot. Implying that there was much better mixing in that shot, than the other. There wasn't a huge difference between the two, and in the stirred shot that might be a few tenths of a percent stronger in that very top layer then the other but backing that up with taste, there was a really noticeable difference. So that's why having tested it, I'm gonna say, don't bother swirling your espresso, get a spoon and stir it. And if the cafe doesn't give you one, well they should, ask for one. It's gonna make your espresso much more enjoyable. There is two more things I should talk about. Firstly, swirling feels pretty fun. But it goes wrong a lot. You've done it, I've done it, if you swirl your espresso, you've made a mess too. Usually at a moment when you're tryna look particularly professional and give it a swirl and you just destroy the place. Secondly, swirling is a thing you see on wine, and swirling wine is a good thing. The shape of a wine glass means when you swirl that liquid, you volatilize a bunch of aromas and they get trapped in the head space above the wine, inside the glass. That way when you smell the glass, you get a really clear picture of that wine. With coffee, an espresso cup, does no trapping of aromas. If you swirl, you'll send a bunch of aromatic compounds volatile, off into the room. Gone forever. Just gone. You don't get to enjoy them, you don't get to smell them really, they're just kind of gone. So there's no real benefit to swirling over stirring. Now at this point you might be rolling your eyes and thinking I have lost my mind. Maybe, maybe, but I like to enjoy my espresso as much as possible and I hope you do to. And I'd be interested to see if you agree.", "videoID": "iI09bbH22vQ"}, {"title": "Weird Coffee Science\uff1a The Hard Bloom", "text": "Welcome to a new series. A series I'm gonna call Weird Coffee Science Stuff, Weird Coffee Science. The idea is this. Over the years, there have been things that I've noticed, things that have bothered me, little ideas that have poked at the back of my brain. And what I wanna do with this series is take one of those things and look at it a little bit more closely and see what we can learn. I'll give you an example, which is gonna be our first topic. I live in a hard water area. And I've made a lot of coffee with hard water over the years. And I believe that brewing with hard water causes your bloom to be bigger. I think harder water blooms more. Now there's a lot of ways that I could just be wrong on this one. Like different coffees, different freshness bloom different amounts. Maybe it was just a little idea that was wrong. So I needed to answer this question. So I got one of these, a graduated cylinder. And the idea was pretty simple. I'm gonna take 10 grams of coffee. I'm gonna add 150 mils of water. I'm gonna measure that volume which will include the bloom. And I'm gonna do it with very soft water and then very hard water. And I'm gonna see if there's a difference. Let's do that then. I was right. I thought I was right, but I was right. Hard water blooms more than soft water. I don't know why. And my first thought is it's probably linked to calcium. So to rule this out, what seems necessary is comparing maybe similarly hard waters with very different levels of bicarb in them for example. Not really. So what if hard water blooms more than soft water? I thought about this. What about when you make coffee if the purpose of the bloom is to get CO2 out? CO2 is a byproduct of the roasting kind of chemistry what's going on in there as things go brown and it's trapped inside the coffee. And when you hit it with water in that bloom phase, a lot of the CO2 comes out. And that's good because that's CO2 coming out, sort of inhibits water getting at the surface of the ground coffee to do the extraction work. So the whole idea behind blooming is you have this phase where the coffee degasses and blooms, and then you brew it once it's easier to kind of get at. So what if you bloom with hard water, but then brew the rest of the brew with kind of softer, more balanced kind of ideal brewing water. What happens then? I'll just do that. I'll brew one with soft water, brew one with a hard water bloom, and then a regular soft water brew after that sort of initial phase. Alright, let me set that up and tell you about today's sponsor. Today's video is sponsored by Squarespace. Now, four years ago, when I needed to build a website for The World Atlas of Coffee, I turned to Squarespace. The reason for that is that it made it so easy for me to very quickly put together a beautiful looking website using one of their templates, but my words and my images. Now you can build a website for anything that you want with Squarespace. You can build a shop to sell unlimited amounts of products. You can build a portfolio, you can build a beautiful page for your cafe or business. Now, over the last four years I haven't had to upgrade anything, patch anything, install anything, it's been worry-free. But if I had an issue, there is 24 seven customer support.

Let's brew some coffee. So I've got my two brews now. I've got my first brew that was just the soft water, and my second brew, which was the hard water bloom followed by a soft water brew. Let's have a little taste. This was brewed first so it is a little bit cooler. They've both been left to cool. Pretty nice. It's got that slightly prickly acidity of maybe not quite enough bicarb in there, it's nice though. Second brew. Really quite different. Texturally quite different. Fuller, definitely. You know, obviously harder water will extract a little bit more but it often just doesn't taste that good. This does taste like a slightly higher extraction. Tastes fuller, a little richer. I miss a little bit of the acid that's in the first cup, but that's definitely interesting. Now I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \"That's some questionable science. \"That's a single test. \"There's a bunch of variables there. \"What did you really learn? \"How do you isolate the impact of that harder water \"on brewing and extraction from the impact on the bloom?\" This is a good point. These are great questions. This is where I'm hoping I can drag you into this. Because if you can run some tests and share with us your experiments, your results, then I think we could maybe learn something. I think there's definitely something here and I don't know what it is yet. But all of us brew coffee all the time, maybe you could brew and do the same thing, bloom with some harder water brew with some soft. Switch it up, do different things.", "videoID": "MpKEdZjpqXM"}, {"title": "Coffee Balls\uff1a Bizarre Or Brilliant\uff1f", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about this. It's a coffee ball. Look, if you just need to pause the video now and get the jokes out of your system, I completely understand. But if you don't know what a coffee ball is, it's this. It is the kind of new 'no pod' pod. A Swiss retailer called Migros launched this at the start of September and I managed to get my hands on some. They're not really launching it outside of, I think, Switzerland and maybe France and eventually Germany next year. So, this took a little wrangling and I'm sort of happy for the help. I did buy this, by the way. I didn't get a freebie, don't worry. This is gonna be an honest kind of first impression of an interesting new idea. Now these things kind of look like they should come in like the little Lindt wrapper and they should be like a little treat that you might eat when you need something sweet. I don't think you necessarily should eat this. Look, it's basically a pod. And if you go to their website, you can see how the technology works. You load this thing into their custom machines, it takes it inside, adds a bit of water to it, squishes it, pushes sort of water through it, and thusly you have espresso. Now, while I've opened this box, I've yet to brew one of these. So I'm gonna open a fresh box for you and we'll brew a shot with one of them and see what we think and then explore a little bit more about how they're doing this and whether it's genuinely an interesting thing. All of their marketing leans very heavily into the whole sustainability piece. You know, I think personal responsibility for sustainability is a thing - to a point. And I don't think, you know, the kind of narrative around \"you recycling a little bit better is what's gonna prevent climate change\" really flies with me but we should not be wasteful, I'm certainly down with that. It's quite a nice experience to open these. Little tear tab there. And then inside, it's a little carton of, it feels like Mini Eggs almost. Ah, on one of these that I opened it said sort of carbon dark side kind of flushed environment, so in theory, once you peel open this packaging, you're gonna introduce some oxygen and you might start the staling process. I have gone with the espresso kind of capsules here. You get nine in a box. And in terms of taste characteristics, we have caramel, citrus, and shortbread. Peel open the inside. That wasn't perfect. That first smell was quite caramelly. I was quite excited. You get a little bit closer and it's a bit more pungent in a slightly more savory, brothy, heavy kind of way. Interestingly, each one has been sort of stamped with the product name on the shell of the coffee ball. So I can just drop my ball in. Good luck. I have to cock the mechanism like so, and then we're gonna ask for an espresso. They're very pleased with the fact that this goes back up to the start. This is giving me a container emptying light on here, but I guess we actually wanna open the container and see what it's done to that little coffee ball. Ooh, now. So you can see what's happened here in that it's been punctured in a variety of ways. It's hot to touch, obviously, but this is now a squishy, softer ball. Now they'll tell you that you can just straight compost these. Couple of weeks, it'll be completely gone because this outer wrapper is made of a sort of seaweed derivative. A bit ashy on the nose. Pretty developed roast. Really pretty dark, I would say a comparable taste experience to Nespresso, a kind of typical Nespresso capsule. Not that I wish to relive that cereal-derived nightmare again. I will say the texture's quite nice, but it looks and tastes like it brewed at too low of a temperature. So I'm just gonna brew one more really quick. What I should do, actually, is show you the hopper that comes with this 'cause I'm also quite charmed by this. And what they sort of want you to do is put all your balls in, and then you put in your sort of top piece, and then they all live in a little compartment. And that's very nice. They're all separated. They're not gonna be airtight or anything like that in there, but they are neatly divided because then, when it's time to brew again, it's like a roulette wheel of death for these little guys. And then who's next? Ooh, ooh. Bye! It's a weird thing to have to do every time. Definitely a hotter brew. For what is probably one of the lighter roasts here, I would say that's still a very developed taste. And I would say that there is a little bit of pre-ground flavor if you want. It doesn't taste super fresh and vibrant. It tastes, you know, it is pre-ground. I'm pretty confident that these little sort of seaweed wraps around the coffee are not, necessarily, gonna be completely airtight. Let's just have a look inside one, shall we? Little gentle cut. Right. Little. That's still a pretty dark roast. Whoops. It's quite neatly packed in here. I dunno if I can tap it out. Ooh, there we go. So it's a pretty fragile looking papery seaweed membrane on these. I don't think they're gonna be fully airtight and so you have to keep them in the gas flushed environment, which means when they go in here, you're certainly accelerating a staling process. And even if it was at peak freshness and, you know, nothing bad had happened, by the time you've gotten through all nine of these, if you have one a day, they'll be tasting pretty stale at that point, which is sort of a shame. You know, you're up against the kind of classic Nespresso pod which has a bunch of technology inside it that's clever, but, a big part of that is it's gas flushed, it's nitrogen, and it's a fully sealed environment. Anyway, the grounds inside here feel quite fine but I wouldn't say espresso fine. Finer than I expected. Perhaps finer than a Nespresso, but not by much. I think the first thing I wanna do, actually, is just see what happens if I just drop a capsule in a glass of water. Will coffee begin to leak from the inside through that kind of seaweed membrane to the outside? Will something weird happen or will it stay pretty intact? I'm impressed. That is still  pretty,  pretty solid. It wouldn't easily deform. Oh, it does a little bit. You can sort of squeeze them. And then it tears. Interesting. More mess. Yeah, it's getting very soft on the outside now. Now, I wanna brew again and kind of go through some of the things that they're doing, I think, inside the machine. I'm gonna brew a different pod, I'm gonna go for a ristretto and see what the sort of stronger experience is like. These balls look a little darker. Yeah. And look, just look how sweet it is to see 'ristretto' on your balls. So, in we go. Cock the mechanism. Let's close the trap door. Let's push the button. Got a little heating sort of flashing moment going on, it's coming up to temperature. And then, there'll probably be a little purge. Little purge. And then, that's probably like the rinse over the ball. Okay. That's enough. So from the taste of the espresso, this temperature in the glass, I would say this is brewing substantially below 90, 95. I would say this is brewing at like 80, 85 (\u00b0Celcius) in terms of water temp. It has that kind of texture and reduced bitterness of brewing at those lower temperatures. It's weird, it has a kind of creaminess while also being quite watery, ultimately. It definitely reminds me of a classic pod profile of like much stronger than filter coffee, not nearly as strong as espresso, but with a weird kind of texture and this kind of halfway house drink that I do find kind of strange. But that's me, some people really enjoy this and we just have different preferences, that's all. That's all. But one thing I will note if you watch the video with the mechanism inside, you'll see that once coffee starts to brew, after it passes through the coffee ball, it has to push a spring away from it to open the sort of exit chute and get out to the cup. Now, this is a really common practice in loads of pod machines because what it does, that spring, it creates artificial back pressure. And it means that the pump can get up to higher pressures than it could if it was just pushing against the coffee 'cause the coffee's a bit too coarsely ground. And so, yes this will say it's a 19 bar machine or some other nonsense. The spring might open at eight, nine, 10 bars, something like that, and it will have to maintain that kind of pressure through the brew. Now doing this helps create more crema. At high pressures, water can become super saturated with CO2, you get more crema, but in addition to that, I think there is some aeration going on here, and I'll show you what I mean by that if I just purge some water through it. So this is interesting. This water looks really cloudy because there's an aerator, I think, in here that's mixed in loads of bubbles and you can see it's starting to clear up, right? The bubbles are dissipating. Now, water can't capture a bubble. It's got no surfactant and it's got no foaming agent in it. It's just water. But coffee does. And so when you mix in a lot of bubbles into coffee, into an espresso type drink, you will turn that into foam basically. So that will enhance the kind of crema alongside the spring inside. I don't think this is cheating. I don't think this is a bad thing, if I'm honest. I think it's a nice use of technology to improve the kind of texture of the finished drink for a coffee drinker. Anything that makes a coffee drink more enjoyable, ultimately, is probably good in my book. These things cost around 55 US cents a ball. I suspect comparably priced with a bunch of other kind of capsules out there in the market. I'm curious how much they weigh. A ristretto weighs 6.1 grams. Let's try the lungo bio. 6.1, 6.2. So whether it's a ristretto or a lungo, it seems to be you're working with a fixed amount of coffee. Actually, we haven't made a lungo yet. Let's make a lungo. I don't think this is sort of bad coffee, it's definitely just not the kind of coffee that I would enjoy. If you like a sort of like classic pod taste profile, then I think that they're certainly delivering that. I don't taste, in any of the beverages, massive issues with extraction. Nothing tastes really uneven. It tastes like the sort of technology basically works okay. Obviously, you know, your coffee cake, there's nothing really we can analyze or see from the inside of this that's gonna be insightful. But from a technical perspective, I don't think it's doing a bad job in terms of extraction or any of that kind of stuff. I would say this is gonna be extracting pretty effectively the coffee in there and whether you like the cup or not is gonna be down to is it good water in there and do you like the taste of this kind of coffee roasted this way? The machine, it's 150 Swiss francs, which is about 150 US dollars these days. It looks fine. It's noisy and vibrate-y. I don't know if that's all of them. I will say it is the single most delightful way to load a coffee machine I think I've ever experienced. The little - let me just open it up one more time. The little  that's great. That's just great. I really like that. Whoever designed that, whoever's idea that was deserves a promotion, deserves a raise. I think that's wonderful. The coffee balls are ridiculously named, but I respect it in that they really committed to this thing and there is no better name and I don't think anyone would forget the name coffee balls in a hurry. So I guess brand building from the get go. I'm really interested in what they wanna do with this. Because if the real mission is to reduce waste, then surely, at some point in the very near future, they would wanna open this system up to other roasters to allow as much coffee as possible to be consumed with less waste. All of your branding, all of your messaging is leading with this out of the gate. Then, will it be an open system in the future or are they just looking for a fresh way to lock in a consumer to a product, have a little walled garden, have them go nowhere else and to make as much money as possible? I do, you know, feel a little bit skeptical when a company that turns over 3 billion euros is preaching a message like this if you don't see a kind of wider action behind it. I think if you were looking at this or a Nespresso system, I think it would be easy to be sort of swayed towards this because the coffee isn't far away from that. There's maybe not the range of choices, but you'd probably feel better about yourself using these even if you were doing the recycling of the aluminum capsules from Nespresso. I like this kind of experimental approach. I think it's good that people are innovating in strange and wonderful ways. I told myself at the start that I had to know what it would be like to eat one. I don't know why I felt I had to do that. But I look at them and I think, could you - could you resist the temptation? But maybe you could resist the temptation if you'd seen someone else go through it. 'Cause this is just ground coffee and seaweed stuff, but it looks edible. It looks tempting. I'm curious if the seaweed has a taste, actually, that would be interesting to find out. That, at least... Maybe I won't chew. We'll find out. Okay. There's something wrong with me. Mmm. Okay. Not bad. Quite sweet. Mmm. Little salty too. Interesting. They're - oh, no. Mmm-mm. Mmm-mm. I've chewed. Oh, no. Mmm-mm. Mmm-mm, mmm-mm, mmm-mm. Urgh. I know that was mostly just ridiculous but genuinely interesting that the outside did taste sweet and slightly salty as well, which is probably a good thing for the end beverage. I think it's probably not a bad addition of flavor. That's interesting. I'm curious if any of you in Switzerland or I think France who have this at home, they've reported tremendous response to this. They kind of sold out everywhere at the start. So it's gone well. Have you got this? Have you tried it? Do you like it? I do wanna know what specialty coffee would taste like inside this system.", "videoID": "JICKZOdDtVc"}, {"title": "An Upgraded Vintage Lever Machine", "text": "We can rebuild him. We have with technology. - Today we're gonna talk about this espresso machine. This is simultaneously both really, really old and brand new, it's a kind of contradiction. It is a Faemina from Faema, it was built in the mid '60s, and I bought it three years ago maybe on eBay, secondhand, not in great condition. And I had a vision for it at that time. Turns out that vision was wrong, and that's kind of what we're gonna talk about today. What I wanted to do was take an old, old lever machine restore it, and then fill it full of modern technology. And I tasked one particular person for this that I thought was best suited Gabor from Smart Espresso Profiler because I, you know, that was the beginning of the whole thing, I wanted a smart espresso profiler on there, track pressure, do that kind of stuff. And I said I wanted to tear this thing to pieces. I wanted to cut in temperature control, PID, all of the stuff. And Gabor said, \"No\". And I said, \"Please.\" And he said, \"No.\" Fair enough, he made a good point, there's a kind of desecration of a beautiful old thing. You can't buy these anymore, you know, they don't make them anymore. What's there globally as stock of these is what's left, and so he felt very uncomfortable cutting one of these pieces, damaging it irreversibly. And so he took a different approach that is, I think, super interesting, and has changed the way I think about these things both on a technical understanding level, and we'll talk about that 'cause there's some super interesting stuff here. But also on a kind of philosophical aesthetic level about how I feel about the beauty of espresso and espresso making. It'll be more nerd than dreamy philosophy today, don't worry. To get the machine to me, Gabor very kindly got on plane with this in his hand luggage brought it to the studio. It meant that we could pull a few shots together and he could teach me a little bit about what he'd learned about the quirks of the machine. Let me talk you through what's been done to this espresso machine, apart from being de-scaled, cleaned up, re-chromed, made to look pretty again. There's a couple of interesting things that I wanna talk about. Now, if you're familiar with the Smart Espresso Profiler, it is a digital pressure transducer. And here it can read the pressures inside the group as the shot is pulling, so I can see this is a spring-driven lever machine, so you can press the spring to build pressure, and release the spring to sort of drive water through coffee. I can see what pressures it achieves, and what's happening in that whole thing. I can also see what's happening during pre-infusion, which we'll talk about later. This has been around for a little while, I've talked about it on the channel before. I've made a video about it before, I'll leave a link down in the description below to that. And a little pressure gauge just for the classic analog experience. What he added was really interesting though. This up here is a Bluetooth thermometer, and it's now able to talk to the Smart Espresso Profiler app. And so we could put two temperature probes into the machine and begin to understand what's going on, and there were two kind of obvious places to put them. This probe runs down here and it runs actually inside the boiler close to the element where the water's always going to be, and it tells you the temperature of the water. When you trap water and you boil it, and you can raise its liquid temperature above a 100 degrees Celsius, your create steam as well, and that's gonna be how this machine has steam for steaming milk if you ever wanna do that. And then also builds pressure if you want to use that for pre-infusion. The second thermocouple is super interesting, that runs here down into, like into the group head itself. And so that gives you a very clear temperature gauge for brew temperature. Like that tells you exactly what's happening as your shot is pulling, and it's been revelatory. And up here is my phone running the software, and I can see on the screen the temperatures, the pressures. It's connected to this Acaia scale and Gabor did a super good little 3D print mod to hold an Acaia scales in the drip tray, which I think looks really good. The original drip tray is unharmed, we will talk more about why, and how, and all that stuff later. If you're not familiar with the app, what you'll see on screen is a red line to show you the pressure captured at any one time, it's time along the bottom. And then also a brown line that'll show you the cumulative mass of coffee in the cup, so that'll give us an idea of flow rate. So while I'm pulling a shot I can see the pressure in the group, I can see the liquid in the cup as a profile, and I can see my temperatures too, and I can save it, use it as a reference profile all of that good stuff. To explain what I've learned and how it's changed the way I think about this machine and about lever espresso making, we should probably pull a shot, so I'm gonna turn it on. The way the machine works is pretty simple, it has an on off switch on this side. And it's got two power switches on this side, a min and a max. Now, this has no additional temperature control from a thermostat kind of perspective. What it does have is this, it's an over pressure valve. And because it has a sort of ceiling on the pressure that the boiler can reach before it releases all that pressure, the boiler technically can never overheat. You know, it might get to 120 Celsius, but it can't contain enough pressure to get any hotter than that. That originally was actually on the cap here, and it's been moved a little shelf has been added, so that my cup can act as a little drip catch point, and cup preheat, Gabor did some very cool stuff here. There's water in the tank at the back, you can sort of see a fill level at the front here, and you can see a spring there too. This is such a fun little machine. I'm gonna turn it on, get it up to temperature, grind some coffee and get ready to pull a shot because it turns out our window for pulling a shot is very small. So the way the whole machine works is pretty simple, if you boil the water you build the pressure, and that's useful. And that's your source of boiling water for pulling shots, and that's also your pressure for pre-infusion, and also to fill the chamber to then press that water through with the spring as we talked about. What we learned with this, this is that the way that the heat spreads through the machine means you've got a pretty small window where you're gonna get good brew temperatures. So this will boil, and it needs to be above boiling to get the pressure we need for pre-infusion. And at about 110 degrees Celsius the group head will be much cooler, but not that much cooler. And so as I start to pull a shot in that tiny window as the water comes out of here, it's 110 Celsius, it'll cool here but also heat up this chamber here too. And it means that my brew temp might be in the mid 90s for the shot. But if I was to pull a shot straight after that, this water might be even hotter, this group head would be even hotter still and I'd be up at boiling point for my entire shot, which is frustrating. So as you're watching this heat up, you can see on the screen that the boiler temperatures now at 60, but the group heads lagging behind like 36 degrees Celsius. And there'll be a pretty big differential in temperatures between the two. I need that temperature here for pre-infusion, otherwise I have a pretty weak pre-infusion and I can't pull a long enough shot. But if I let that go too far, my brew temp's all over the place, I'm gonna have a bad time. And it's kind of stressful, you get this really small window. Now, the basket on these things it's pretty small, so we're gonna be dosing about 15 grams of coffee into this thing. It's a double basket, little dosing ring, also from Gabor, very nice. And then once we've distributed and tamped we're gonna put an AeroPress filter on the top, a sort of a a damp paper filter on top because the water as it comes out of the shower screen, it's a bit aggressive. And so adding that layer of paper is a bit like a puck screen to sort of dampen the violence of the water coming through, so you're less likely to have channeling and sort of harshness in your shots that way. As for a tamper, the original Faemina had a tamper built in, and Gabor again has kept the original, but modded it to make it better. I say better, it's still not as good as a hand tamp. But here at the back he's added a stainless steel piston and a ring to make sure that you're gonna tamp level and evenly, which is appreciated. If you've ever had one of those grinders where you had to lift it up to tamp on the front, the kind of commercial grinders, they really sucked, it was bad, I don't recommend it at all. But here I can be confident, I'm level and even, I'm gonna have a good time. About 90 degrees Celsius inside the boiler now, 47 in the group head, so there's this weird gap. But as you'll see when we pull a shot, that temperature in this group head comes up really quickly. Now, if you're wondering if the min setting on the element gives you more control? Not really, it just seems to stall you out wherever you are, but understand that while a boiler may not get hotter, there's still heat transfer going into the group. So unfortunately that's not a way to kind of cheat the process much, though I do tend to turn off max once I've started pulling my shot because I know I'm gonna wanna cool the thing down relatively soon if I want another really good shot afterwards. So distractingly, now that we're above boiling point, you can hear a little steam coming outta the over-pressure valve. It's gonna be a gentle hiss in the background, we might tune it down in post so you can hear can hear me nice and clearly. So at 102 Celsius in the boiler, 67 in the group, we're getting pretty close to sort of go-time. Turn you this way so I can see what's going on a bit more. Coming up when we hit 110, pull the lever, start the pre-infusion. Ugh, there we go. A little bit of pressure on that pre-infusion, interesting. I'm gonna run for about 20 seconds. Brew temp 93. Peaking about five bars, so older spring, it's not really something to worry about. Look at the ooey gooey espresso. Now, I have no control over the end mass of this thing. It's gonna be what it's gonna be, and typically they're pretty short shots, less than one to two, with the 15 gram dose, like 25 grams out has been kind of it. But the shots have been, and you nail everything pretty good. Let me move this away, so it's a little less hissy, and get a spoon. Now, I'm not reviewing this machine, not really. So the quality of the espresso isn't really super under the microscope here, but does it make nice shots? Pretty tasty, nice texture, nice mouthfeel to it, tastes pretty evenly extracted. It's a shorter shot and you can taste that in it, it's a little bit more acidity than I might want. And maybe next time with a roast like this I could go a little hotter, and maybe, you know, brew 95, 96 and balance it out a little bit. It's a slow shot, you know, it's a 45 second total shot, maybe 20 seconds of pre-infusion. So it's a pretty slow drawn out affair, but the nature of this kind of a brew is that it's not under pressure like that the whole time. It kind of works. I enjoyed that, it was tasty, it was sweet, it was well made. I can nitpick it, but that isn't really the point, and that's not really the experience of owning one of these things. So here is the temperature data for three shots pulled back-to-back. In between I'm running the boiler in min mode rather than max, so that each time the boiler temperatures are kind of similar, but you'll see as one shot to the next, to the next. We go from sensible brew temperatures up to very high brew temperatures, up to unusably high brew temperatures. Now that I know how it works, now that I know that I've got this really small window between the boiler getting to the right temperature and the rest of the machine overheating and then some having to kind of cool it down or reset it in some way to pull another shot, I find the machine more frustrating the more I know. And I worry about analysis paralysis, which can totally happen. Now, I love data, I love getting into it, but I do wonder if, you know, getting all of the data out of this particular machine is kind of good for a brain like mine. If you just gave me this shot and I drank it, and I didn't know where it came from, or how hard it was to pull, or any of that stuff, I might enjoy it more. Or maybe less, maybe I'd enjoy it more knowing that I had had conquered a difficult thing. But people love these things still, people have used them for literally decades despite the fact that they're really fussy in finicky once you understand what's actually happening under the hood. And at the end of it, I can't help but feel that Gabor's decision to make everything completely reversible was a brilliant one because I could see a future for this where it has none of the bells and whistles, where you understand it and you've built your workflow, but maybe you just want to be in the process, you just wanna make your espresso and not get all the data out all the time. And for people like me who wanna play, and understand, and tweak, I'm so excited that this technology exists now and that it is improving and evolving. But whoever gets this machine, I could understand if they wanted to take it out after a while, if they wanted to kind of go back to the bare bones of just them, intuition, feeling, smell, sight, taste, all of that stuff and make coffee in a different kind of way. And you know, the experience of this machine has again reminded me that making espresso is always about more than just the end result. It's about process, it's about skill and craft, and all of the stuff in between, it's about endless gear acquisition to those of us broken in this specific way. But this has been a good reminder of the fundamentals, of what's fun about espresso at the heart of it.", "videoID": "hBdiBV-yzlk"}, {"title": "The (Accidentally) Annual Q&A\uff1a Tiramisu \uff5c Decaf \uff5c Travel Gear & More!", "text": "This video is sponsored by Squarespace.

So I left the questions to the Patron supporters and they could avert each other's questions and I've picked a bunch. I'm going to answer them pretty quickly and talk about a whole bunch of different stuff. Let's go. What's your coffee related guilty pleasure that you find hard to admit? It's difficult now, because for a long time, I would have said the Starbucks frappuccino because I had a soft spot for that particular thing and I had a couple of instances in my life of being like, stuck somewhere at two in the morning and needing to drive for a couple more hours and just needing some sort of coffee and that just hitting the spot. But I had one a couple of weeks ago and it was not that good so I'm kind of conflicted now. I don't really know what a truly guilty pleasure is. I think they're just all pleasures and I don't feel enough guilt. Maybe I was just raised a certain way. What's the most, what the hell is going on here, moment that I've had in a coffee shop? I've had quite a number of the where is my coffee? Because someone's worked out it's me and they're freaking out and they're just making the same espresso over and over and over and over and over again in the hope of just somehow nailing it into this perfect shot. Despite the fact that coffee can't be that good, like there's no coffee in the world worth waiting 20 minutes for, right. There's a period of time where you'll wait for something if it's worth it, but at some point the wait time exceeds the capacity of coffee to be excellent. I think the other one that springs to mind is I walked into a coffee shop in the US and the barista or the person at the counter was like oh no, not you. And they just turned around and walked away and just left the register and just left. And someone very confused from the back of the shop had to come out and kind of make me coffee and had no idea who I was as this person had just abandoned ship. So that was kind of weird. Are you planning to do a worldwide tasting this year? I really hoped to do something. The world's largest coffee tasting got really big last year. It was 17 and a half thousand kids went out and that was logistically awful, like really unpleasant for everyone involved. The  team worked really, really, really hard and I don't know if I could ever ask that of them again. We had helped with the logistics too, and even then it was just bad. I do want to do a global tasting of sorts where the logistics are totally different, but that requires travel be a thing and a host of other logistical challenges. But I am working on something. Will it be this year, probably not. Can you post something about roasting coffee at home? The equipment, guides, techniques? You know, can I do some home roasting stuff? Now obviously I have some experience and understanding with coffee roasting as a whole. I haven't really delved into home roasting in a while, but it is pretty high up on the list of kind of big projects for the channel. The one thing I know is true is that if you think espresso is like too much as a hobby, coffee roasting takes that and adds an order of magnitude more pain in every single way. It is more frustrating, more annoying,, it will drag you down a deeper kind of upgrade artist kind of curve. It's not a saving money kind of thing. Like if you think making your own cappuccino in the morning saves you money compared to going to a coffee shop, you quickly understand that's not true. And the same is true with roasting. All of that said yeah, you can save money if you roast your own coffee, that's true, but it is an enormous investment of your time and how you value your time and all that kind of stuff. Anyway, I do want to do some roasting stuff for sure. I want to do like a series of different stuff, the basics of home roasting, the kind of ideas behind coffee roasting and some more equipment kind of stuff. It is slowly underway. I own some interesting roasters now, but it's going to be a while if I'm honest. Natural of washed? Washed. what do you do when you get to the end of a bag of coffee and there aren't enough beans for a usual dose? Is blending those last few beans with some other beans a travesty, is it better than just wasting them? Anything is better than wasting them, so don't throw them away. Yes, make a blend. Make a blend because blends are interesting. And again, it should be a great topic for a video, blends should be almost more than the sum of their parts. And when you start to sort of accidentally blend, you'll see that two coffees that should work together sometimes kind of don't. Some things that shouldn't work really kind of do. And it's just a fun little experiment with no real downside. So 100% blend a little of the old,with a little of the new, see how it tastes, learn a thing, discover a thing, and then enjoy the next bag of coffee and have some fun. So I'm going to summarize this next question cause it's quite long and it's basically, do I have a kind of opinion on a travel setup? Now I have been slowly acquiring traveling type things because I really want to kind of work out what my ultimate travel setup is, right. It needs to be incredibly lightweight. It needs to be kind of everything. I'll show you what I'm not aiming for, which is this. This is very nice. Don't get me wrong, this is very nice indeed. This is a travel kind of case of the stuff from Timemore. They sent it to me, but it's just--  Here you go, it's all of the things. You've got your grinder and you've got kettle and you've got papers for your pour over and you've got little beans cellars here. It's everything you would need. I just don't know how to pack that into anything, right. Do I put it in my suitcase? It's kind of weird for my hand luggage. It's got a little handle. Am I supposed to like briefcase it through the airport? Or, I don't know. It's really nice, but these kinds of things, I just don't really feel like they work. It's a nice kind of gift set more than a travel set to me. So one second. These are some of the kinds of things that I've been buying cause I'm kind of curious about them. So this is, this was sent to me actually. It's called a Primula, it's a sort of reusable, nylon mesh pour over filter, which is kind of interesting. It's completely flat, so super easy to travel with. And then you've kind of got the jigsaw puzzle of this particular thing, the Tetra drip, which you kind of, you know, build out into being a little kind of cone brewer. That's kind of interesting. I'm buying random scales, one sent me a link to these. These are, where are they? They unfold and you can put them down and weigh stuff on them and put things on them. That's kind of weird and interesting. So I'll get there. I don't camp much, I haven't been camping in a long time. I'm not against camping, I just haven't been for a long time, but I am slowly trying to find the smallest neatest setup possible that actually makes great coffee. They do also ask what my ideal vacation is. I feel like, I don't know, it's like asking about a last meal at this point. It feels so alien and so impossible to pick one thing. Anything, anything would be good! I feel like I'm not very good at vacations. I forgot how to do them for a few years when I worked too much and that was very unhealthy. And then I felt like I got back in the rhythm and now I've forgotten how to do vacations again. They're hard to do and I don't know. So I have no idea, anything would be good. There's lots of places I want to go. The world is too interesting to not want to see it all. So this question, I just thought it was a really interesting question. So you know, they highlight that I made a video about how to brew better dark roasts, and it's almost like how to enjoy dark roasts more if you're a light roast lover, but what about the opposite way around? Like how to enjoy light roasts if you like dark roasts? That's a really interesting way of doing things and actually a really interesting question. And I like it a lot cause it sort of repositions who's right in the kind of preference world. I think the thing for me, the boring answer to me is you would just want to have a lot of buffer in there because I suspect the thing that people who like dark roasts don't like about light roast is all that acidity. And I think you could use brew water that had a lot more bicarbonate in it and therefore mute out the acidity while still having a lot of flavor and aroma from the brew. Or you could do the thing I did a video on once where you could just make up a solution of bicarbonate and then just add a little bit to your coffee instead of sugar to sort of mute that acidity. That I think would be an interesting way to kind of make light roasts more enjoyable to people who like dark roasts. Dose up a little bit more. I think that people who like dark roasts like a little more intensity, so I'd brew 65, 70 grams a liter as well. Another good question. Are we making espresso too complicated to actually enjoy the process? Doing too much for diminished returns? I just realized that RDT, which is the droplet technique to stop the static into a basket with a paper filter on the bottom, I use a tool to WDT, which is the waste distribution technique to declump it. I distribute with an OCD spray, the pack, level with tamper, put a BPlus screen and then make a coffee, is that too much? And I would say maybe if you don't enjoy ritual and process. My feeling is we're getting closer and closer and closer to really understanding the kind of minimalist path to great espresso. You know, in the past we were doing things like pulling volumetric shots based on kind of how they looked. When we moved to weighing grams and grams out, that made everything much simpler and much easier and much more direct and we got rid of a bunch of kind of nonsense around coffee making. I think the other thing that we know now is that channeling is the big challenge. You know what I mean? And so de-clumping your ground is a solid and sensible step to help reduce channeling. I don't know about the distribution tools that are out there, the kind of spinning ones. I'm still not particularly convinced on them, but I do think distribution of coffee and de-clumping it and those kinds of tools are useful. There's some wire tools I like much more than the spinny spinny tools. I say spinny spinny too much. I think it's easy to sort of endlessly try and optimize. I'm personally pulling in the direction of what is the least work I can do to get great espresso? You know, and I think we learn from each other along the way. Now I had a lot of questions about decaf and I think I've talked in various places about this. There is a big decaf project. It is enormous in scale and scope. And so it's slow and it's going to involve logistics on multiple continents. It's going to involve enormous amounts of coffee and money, and it's moderately terrifying, but there are some great people helping me with it. So there will be a big series, a big kind of experience around decaf because it needs I think to be experiential. All of your decaf questions will be answered. I just don't know when would the state of global logistics and also travel being what it is. But I will say decaf can be great, delicious, diverse, wonderful. I just shot a video that involved decaf for someone else's second channel that we're coming out fairly soon that I feel will hopefully prompt a bit more discussion about how good decaf can be, because it can be really, really good if everyone cares and each stage of the process is done really well. So this one's a bit tricky, which is what are your thoughts on these sustainability claims that all roasters make? How can we as consumers know what claims actually mean? How to differentiate between what's genuine and what is little more than marketing? There was a lot of likes on this question from the rest of the group, which made me feel like you wanted an answer here. The truth is you realistically can't tell, right. You can't meaningfully audit those companies. And there's a quantity of trust required to believe the claims, and whether they've earned your trust in a myriad of ways or not is kind of up to the relationship you have with that roaster. And I'm not saying I would be distrustful of anything anyone says at face value, but I would be aware it's really hard to audit that stuff. And yeah, it maybe helps if they're a B-corp, but I've certainly seen questionable B-corps in my time. You know, different certifications answer different questions, but ultimately it's almost impossible to really tell who's following through and who's not. And I wish that wasn't the case. And I wish I could give you like a nice little hacky shortcut to it, but I can't. So I'm sorry that's a sort of terrible answer in every way, but it is what it is. I like this question. What would your advice be for someone who is looking to keep improving their home setup? Do not upgrade to the thing that everyone is talking about for the sake of upgrading. Do not upgrade because you can or you can afford it. Upgrade to buy a thing that fixes a specific problem that you are having, right? Like, you need to understand what's holding back your current coffee making experience and solve for that. That's the right pathway. And honestly, oftentimes it's going to be the coffee itself or it's going be the water treatment or those kinds of things that are actually the limiting factor on the quality of the coffee that you make at home. And probably not the machine or the grinder really. You know the incremental gains are so small for so much money at the top end of everything in this world that unless it fixes a specific problem, I would be questioning what's motivating the upgrade. That's my approach. How much time goes into making one of your videos and what software do you use for editing? I own a Mac, I'll go backwards on the answer here. I own a Mac so we use Final Cut. A couple of us edit here. Occasionally we work with external editors. But yeah, here we edit on Final Cut because it's optimized for Macs, it's super fast. We think in Final Cut now and so we can cut pretty quickly with it and intuitively, and we sort of cut similarly, Michael and I who edit. So that's that, how much time goes into one of them? This is a little easier if we're honest. Like I'm going to talk to the camera for a while and then we're going to take that file and cut out all the bits where I make mistakes or I spill coffee or just my hair looks wrong. And then we have a video. In other cases, shoots can last two, three days, sometimes more and they can take a long time to put together and maybe a day or two to edit. Oh yeah, and then I guess there's also researching, there's product testing. If it's a product, it could have been used for a few days, a few weeks, in some cases a few months. It really depends on the product and the nature of the review. Research can take time. Yeah you know, getting a thumbnail down, that's something I'd like to get better at and titles and all of those kinds of things. I'm glad to some estate that we don't do like blog posts with everything too, because that would just I think be too much. but yeah, a good amount of time goes into everything, which is why I probably don't make more and probably should aspire to make less So I can invest more time per video and make fewer videos per month, but better videos per month. So it depends on the scope and the scale of the project. But yeah, we will at some point do like a studio tour here If people want that, maybe on Instagram, and show you kind of what the setup is and what our kit is, what gear we use, if you want to know that stuff. So follow me on Instagram. I think it'll turn up there probably rather than YouTube. Yeah we'll do that at some point. But yeah, we are not obsessed about that stuff. We just want it to go faster and easier. It's just about friction. That's our upgrade path. We're solving to reduce friction and go faster and go easier and go quicker, all of those things, that's what's meaningful to us, saving time. Which coffee related thing do you feel people are wrong about on the internet most often and why? The thing that I think people are most often wrong about is that the idea of a singular best. A singular best coffee, a singular best brew or extraction of that coffee, a singular best grinder, a singular best machine. There is no best. There's not a single peak that you're driving towards. There's no shared destination. There are many, a myriad of them. We're all pulling in different directions. And I know I do comparisons and I try and pick a ultimate thing or the best thing, but that's why it's so heavily caveated that it's my best thing for my needs with my experiences as I've tested them and yours might be different. And I really dislike it when people are like no, that's not the best, this is the best. You know, that's not how you should do it, this is how you should do it. I think the idea of a singular ultimate thing is wrong, frustrating, and the source of a lot of unnecessary conflict on the internet. Hey James, how are you? I mean, you like to keep your private life private and that's very important. It's just some really challenging at times and I want to know how you're doing. Ultimately I'm doing all right. I'm tired, I am pretty exhausted. I don't think that's an unusual experience for many people here. I know some people are rested and that's good. And I know a lot of people will probably hear this bit of the video and be like, look after yourself. All I'll say, you too! Right, if you're telling me to just relax, chill, take some time, I hope you are doing the same for yourself cause you probably need it. But yeah, I would say I'm a little tired. I need to change the way I'm working. I think the pandemic has been intense. YouTube got big, work got challenging outside of YouTube Like, you know, the world was difficult and needed a lot of time and attention and stuff. Investment of thought and effort. So yes, I'm a little bit tired and vacationing is still not easy. So I'm trying to work that out, but I'm ultimately very good, I am very good. I have no real complaints at all, but thank you for asking and I hope you're doing good too. Kind of connected, you have your fingers in so many pies. That's such a gross phrase. No disrespect to you, it's the phrase, but it's also kind of weird at this point. What does an average working day look like for you? I have no average day. I have not had an average day for the longest time. I don't know what an average day looks like anymore. Today, you know what time is it now, it's nearly four o'clock. This morning was like work, planning, strategy, plotting, working on the new studio space, all of that kind of stuff. This phone call is still to happen today. And meetings tomorrow will be like a little bit of writing. I'm still trying to finish up a book. I'm giving a talk at an event, you know, the day before yesterday, what was yesterday? Oh, it was like filming a video with someone else. I filmed a video with Tom Scott of all people, which was lovely. And then just like meetings and stuff. I kind of bounce around and there's no normal. I have a little bit of chaos and that's why I need some help managing my chaos and I have some good help, but I have no normal. I have no normal, it's every day is different. And some days that's wonderful and other days that is completely exhausting and frustrating. Again, I'm not complaining. I don't know if that's an answer. I don't know if I can answer this question. I don't even know what I do for a living anymore. It's all very confusing. When will we get the tiramisu recipe video? So this video is going to have at least two parts of it and one of the parts involves me eating an enormous amount of tiramisu at different restaurants around London and going to restaurants has only recently been vaguely sensible, so that's kind of held it back. I still want to do this, but it involves, you know, I need to set a benchmark. I need to understand what I want tiramisu to be. I've eaten a lot of trashy tiramisu in my life. I've eaten some fancy tiramisu. I want to eat a whole lot more and really pay attention and then kind of decide where I want to go with my version. So I don't know, maybe this year, it could be this year. I would like to go and eat like 20 different tiramisus around London and feel incredibly ill afterwards. That would be good. And take you with me, it's coming. Do you think coffee culture around the world is getting too similar? I sometimes have the feeling all coffee bars look the same. In some ways yes, like there's a lot of the same and I feel like we don't and we haven't historically celebrated, you know, people who experiment and take risks quite as much as we should. But then again, there's also the kind of culture that we exist in only really celebrates and pays attention to certain styles of businesses. You know, like I feel like we pay our attention to certain styles of coffee bars and not necessarily to others. I think there's loads of different coffee bars and styles of stuff out of there. They're just not considered cool or interesting or relevant to what we do and I think that's a big mistake and I you know, when it comes to travel or even just in the UK and London, I'm still very interested in exploring coffee culture outside of the sort of narrow definition of modern specialty coffee. Because you know, there are other ways to drink coffee and other cultures of coffee drinking that exists outside of this one. So yeah, I think within modern specialty coffee, things can be a bit homogenous, but at the same time, we're not paying much attention to things outside of that kind of realm. I think the last question for today. Which item you reviewed was the most difficult for you to give away, like the one you would most liked to have kept? Well, I think if you've watched the videos, you probably know the answer. At the end of the ultimate grinder showdown, I felt very sad giving all of them away actually. I'd gotten very used to a life of very fancy grinders in the studio every day. And so we bought an EG-1 cause we loved having it here and we missed that and the minute that it left and there was a gap, I sort of sent it away and ordered one. And there was you know, a couple of months before it shipped. You know that leap forward in quality, that incremental game was one thing, but going back actually just felt harsh and I'm not complaining about the grinders I was using in the meantime. But yeah, just having something that worked that way, that felt that way, just brought me a lot of pleasure. That's a very enjoyable grinder to use. So there'll be another Q&amp;A soon, keep your eyes out for where we'll kind of collect the questions from, but now is a very short ad for this video's sponsor, which is Squarespace.

I'm here to say it's not, and it doesn't exist, and I should explain myself. Turns out, we use the word 'strength' in a really confusing way. In fact, we use it four different ways and I would argue only one of those is correct, and so today we're gonna go through each of the ways that we use the word strength, understand it a little bit more, learn from it little bit more, and at the end of it, I think you'll understand how I can claim that there is no strongest coffee in the world. Now I have here a bag of coffee from one of the many brands claiming to sell the strongest coffee in the world. I have pixelated and blurred it because having looked into it, mostly they're very small companies, often they don't even roast themselves, and I'm not here to to be mean as someone else's business just 'cause I sort of disagree with their marketing. What's inside the bag though, I think is a pretty good example of what you're typically being sold with these kind of coffees. Let's have a look. This coffee is a pretty dark-roasted Robusta coffee. That's the species, Robusta. And what you'll tend to find is that Robusta, broadly speaking, has about twice the caffeine content of Arabica because the first way that we use the word strength is to talk about caffeine content. The more caffeine it has, the stronger it is. And I kinda understand where they're going with that, but caffeine's not as simple as you want it to be. Now, caffeine is pretty water-soluble. So you'd think however much is in the ground coffee should end up in the cup, but confusingly, it doesn't always seem to be that way. You'll see loads of studies where they go out and buy drinks from different coffee shops and they report the caffeine content in there, and they're really variable in kind of a surprising way. But broadly speaking, the amount of caffeine in your cup of coffee will correlate to how much was in the beans to start with and then how effectively you've extracted it from there. But, you know, only part of that really is intrinsic to the coffee itself. And yes, Robusta has on average, twice the caffeine content but it can be more, it can be less. Very rarely do I see anyone reporting a kind of milligrams of caffeine per kilo or per gram of coffee on the bags. I think most people are just saying, \"Oh, it's Robusta, it's twice the caffeine, \"yes, this is very strong.\" I guess we should brew this up. So we've got a cup of coffee with, I suspect a good amount of caffeine in it, but you know, there's certainly ways to brew coffee where you might get more out, I think longer steeps for example would probably be more effective, something like a very long French press brew or like a super long AeroPress brew if you're desperate for full access to caffeine, but here's the thing. You can buy caffeine in pill form. If you're desperate for caffeine, there are much gentler ways to consume it. You can have the cup of coffee that you want and just take a caffeine pill if that's your kind of requirement. As for whether caffeine is a good idea or not, well, we made a video all about caffeine. I'll leave it linked up here and the description and down below. You can make up your own mind about how much caffeine you should be consuming. Now, the second way that we use strength in this kinda scenario is one that you've seen on the front of a bag of coffee. In fact, we made a video about this as well, about buying coffee and understanding what the labels mean. Often, you'll see a strength rating on a bag of coffee. And again, that's kind of back to an intrinsic quality of the coffee. And really what they're saying there is not strength, they're giving you roast level. So a strength five will be a very dark roast, a strength two will be a very light roast. It's nothing really to do with the word 'strength'. It's a completely inappropriate use of the word strength, but it's a sort of nice way for sort of supermarkets and others to talk about roast level in a way that doesn't involve the complexities of trying to describe the color of a coffee bean. Now that shorthand on the outside of a bag really is shorthand for the third way that we use strength, which is kind of intensity of bitterness, let's go with that. Like you might sip a coffee that's incredibly bitter and say, \"Ugh, too strong, I don't like it.\" And that a very sort of good word for communicating what you like or don't like, but it's actually not quite the correct word. The idea should be, \"Ooh, that's too bitter. \"that's too harsh.\" \"That tastes burned, that tastes bad.\" But too strong actually is talking about something else. This coffee... Oof, yeah, is a pretty dark roast of Robusta, which itself typically has higher levels of bitterness. So, this cup tastes very bitter, but it would be incorrect of me to say this cup tastes very strong. But all of this brings us to the sort of final usage of the word 'strength', the one that I think is the correct usage, the one that certainly we use here on this channel, and I'm gonna give you a sort of more in-depth explanation of why it's important to use that term, strength and actually how it's really useful to understand it when it comes to better coffee brewing every day. All of that will come after a short ad from this video's sponsor, which is Squarespace. If you need a website or a domain, then I would recommend Squarespace. They make it so easy.

So the true definition of strength in coffee, the true meaning, the true understanding really is trying to answer the question of, \"How much of this cup is water \"and how much is dissolved ground coffee?\" And that tells me essentially how strong the cup is. If you drink alcohol, you'll be familiar with the idea of strength from an alcohol perspective. On the side of a beer or a glass of wine, or a bottle of whiskey, you'll see a percentage of alcohol that tells you how strong it is, how much of this shot of whiskey is ethanol, might be 40% booze, and you understand how strong that is. If it's a glass of wine, it might be 10, 12, 14. The percentage makes sense of the strength in a very neat, easy way. You can do exactly the same thing with a cup of coffee. You can use a little device to calculate what percentage of this cup is dissolved ground coffee. Typically speaking, a filter coffee will be anywhere from one to one and a half percent strength as a kind of ballpark. It will vary, and as I said, there's no right answer there, but that's the kinda rough strength that you'll find in filter coffee. Espresso is more like 8 to 12%, somewhere there. So nothing really gets past wine levels of strength. Now the way we calculate strength these days is to use a refractometer. These are devices that you put a sample of coffee onto the little readout here and you push a button and it calculates the refractive index. Now, any liquid will have a refractive index. It's essentially the speed of light through that liquid, but being overly simplistic probably doesn't help. Then a coffee focus refractometer will take the refractive index, do a little bit of mathematics, a little bit of algorithmic work, and spit out a percentage strength of coffee. You can't measure coffee's strength with a typical refractometer that isn't built for coffee because it doesn't do the algorithmic conversion to a percentage strength, specific for the beverage. There's a couple of these on the market. The pioneering model was from VST, which is this one here, a guy called Vince Fedele did it. Fundamentally changed the coffee brewing game forever by allowing us to understand how strong a cup of coffee was in a really accurate way. Why is that important? That's a very good question. Because on its own, strength isn't actually particularly useful. I could measure the strength of this cup of coffee and I could taste it, and I could say, \"Ooh, it tastes bad and the strength is this, \"therefore that strength is bad,\" but that's not the way it works. And in fact, if I dilute this down, the quality of this cup of coffee is the same, the flavors that it has are the same, but it is now a weaker cup. So, strength on its own is actually not that important. What it is though, is a point of preference. How strong you like your coffee is down to you. There's no right answer in the world of strength. Once you work out what strength you like, you can kind of work out how much coffee you should use to get to that strength, but if you know how much of this cup is coffee essentially or dissolved coffee, and you know how big the cup of coffee is or what the mass of the coffee is, then as long as you know how much coffee you started with, you can calculate extraction. Now that seems immediately a little bit confusing so I'll go with a different sort of practical example. I pulled two double shots of espresso. I dosed 20 grams in each time and I pulled about 40 grams out each time. In the end, I had about 80 grams of liquid that went into a dehydrator, and then the two spent pucks that started at being 20 grams each, they went into a dehydrator. And this is kind of how it used to work, though they really only used to focus on the spent pucks of coffee and not so much the liquid. Let's see what we get at the end of that. So I've got two pucks. These would've weighed 40 grams in total to start with. Obviously, when you've freshly brewed them, they've got quite a lot of water inside them so you can't really tell how much coffee you got out. But if we weigh them now, stack them up, they now weigh 32.4 grams. So you can say if I started with 40 grams and I've got 32.4 grams, then I took out 7.6 grams in terms of my extraction. That's how much dissolved coffee was taken from this puck and put into the cup that would be consumed. If you divide 7.6 by 40 or you turn it into a percentage, you've got 19%. So you would say that I've extracted 19% of the ground coffee. Now, historically there were guidelines on the desired level of extraction. It was said to be sort of 18 to 22% was the the good range for coffee brewing. What we've found more recently is that we've been able to take that number higher and higher and higher using different techniques, different grinders, a whole bunch of other stuff without it tasting bad, but in many scenarios, 18 to 22% is a good starting point in this whole thing. So on a kind of technical level, these were good brews, not incredible, not bad, but kind of fine. This is what we extracted. And what we've made here is possibly the world's worst instant coffee. This is kind what instant coffee is, except you don't dehydrate it in a hot environment. Instant coffee is freeze-dried to concentrated. As a result, you end up with a much nicer looking end product that doesn't taste nearly as bad. This has just been cooked to dry and would be completely disgusting. It's sort of, I'll see if I can, oh yeah. But all of this here, it's basically, yeah, it's basically instant coffee. Don't drink this. I presume it would taste completely terrible. You would assume this would taste terrible. I mean, it should, it will taste terrible. I'm gonna have to taste it, aren't I? I don't know whether to turn it into a cup of coffee or just to eat it. This has been cooked for two days. This was an espresso cooked for two days, dried out, oh no. It's disgusting, but it also really tastes like Marmite or Vegemite, like it, really, very savory. Oh, there it goes, okay. Why am I doing this? This is not the point of this video. Look, kids. If you make your own instant coffee, use a freeze dryer. Don't dehydrate it in a small dehydrator, that's disgusting. I'll wrap up as I recover from that. Why is this important? Well, very simply, I use the term 'strength' quite a lot. I'll talk about strength, the impact of different grinders or brew methods on strength and then extraction too, and I did think it was time to make a video discussing that and explaining that in a little bit more detail, explaining refractometers, explaining the kinda mechanics of extraction in a way. By using strength in a whole host of different ways, I think it's actually really confusing and frustrating. If I took, let's say a light roast of a decaf coffee and I brewed it at a really high ratio, or I pulled a shot of it, right? That would be low strength because it's a light roast according to the kind of strength rating. It would be low strength 'cause it's decaf, it's got no caffeine in it. It would be low strength because it probably wouldn't taste particularly bitter as an espresso, but it would probably be about 10% strength as a beverage, which means it would be really strong.", "videoID": "8jAMOAmYCJI"}, {"title": "The Fellow Ode Grinder - 2020's Most Anticipated Coffee Product", "text": "Today we're gonna look at this. It is probably the most hyped product of 2020 when it comes to coffee at home. It is a grinder by a company called Fellow. It is called The Ode. Now they launched this on Kickstarter. Now there are two types of companies that use Kickstarter. There's the kind of traditional kind, what Kickstarter was set up for, which is they wanna make a thing. They've got a prototype, but they can't afford some of the costs of manufacturing. So you're kind of helping them kickstart a project and make the thing. Then there is a second kind of company that has its manufacturing pretty much locked down. It's got as prototypes done, and really it's using Kickstarter to build hype, build interest and pre-sell a product at a discount. And that's unquestionably what Fellow are doing with The Ode. If you watch their video, well, their Kickstarter was trying to raise a couple hundred thousand dollars. The video promoting the Kickstarter looks to me like a six figure video. They spent a lot of money marketing this thing. So it was most definitely a pre-sale. And in doing so, they have perhaps set expectations too high. This is a $300 domestic coffee grinder that will not and should not, and is not designed to do espresso. It is built for filter coffee and filter coffee only. They are trying to do a good job of that particular set of challenges. They're not trying to compete with something like the Niche or grinders that are going into that very fine espresso range. So what I want to do today is talk about the grinder. I'm gonna split that into two parts. The first part will be the kind of features and functionality of the grinder, how it is to use the little design decisions that they've made and how they might impact your experience using it. Then we'll get into what is ultimately a conversation about the burr set. The burrs inside this grinder are interesting. They've made a bunch of decisions that have a bunch of impacts on you, the consumer, and we are gonna talk about that. One more quick note, this grinder is a 110 volt US model. I'm running it through a very chunky converter behind the scenes here. This is not an EU model. Fellow very kindly agreed to ship me one from the US stock ahead of time, because I wanted to get on and review the product. I was a Kickstarter Backer, but I was expecting an EU unit. It's also nice that when I give this away, I can give it away to someone on 110 volts, instead of usually giving stuff away to people on 220 volts. Anyway, for now, let's get into an overview of the grinder. Now first and foremost, this thing is very small. It's beautifully small. I think it's a very nicely designed. It's beautiful looking, but it's tiny. It's footprint is small. It's clearance is very low. It will fit under any kitchen cupboards in the world. To do that, they've also pretty much gotten rid of the hopper in a meaningful way. It does have a bean hopper, but it's designed for a single dosing. It will hold up to 80 grams of coffee though it's unlikely someone's single dosing 80 grams very often. On the inside of the lid, you do have a grind guide chart. I think this is a bit of a mistake. I think it's a good idea. I just think the execution has some problems, but we'll come back to this when we talk about the burr set itself. Well, you've got your standard safety protections at the top of the hopper, and you're designed to sort of weigh what you need, pour it in, hit go. On the front, you've got a very, very large step dial. It feels very nice to adjust it. I think the increments are fine enough for a stepped grinder. I don't think you need a step less grinder in this kind of a situation. I think stepped is absolutely fine. And then the only other thing that you're really interacting with on the front of the grinder, is the on off button here. It does beep and I don't know why because I know it's on, I can hear the motor. I don't need to be beeped to be reminded of that. But that aside, as you can hear, the motor itself is actually pretty quiet. And when it comes to grinding coffee, this thing's also relatively quiet too. Now they've done a couple of things that are interesting here with the ground catch bin. As I think they're called. Here, you'll see a magnet and here is a magnet. So this thing very neatly clicks into place. So it's always exactly where it needs to be. And that's nice. Inside here the little lid has some fins and this designed to help the flow of pouring ground coffee. One small complaint though, is this little rubber lid, unless it's perfectly seated, if you don't quite get it on right, then it doesn't do the magnet thing properly. So that for me is a little tiny frustration and what should be a very pleasing experience otherwise. One more thing before I forget is it does have this thing, a little knocker on the side of things. Now these you see on big commercial grinders, it's got a bag knock usually, or something like that. It's designed to knock out the last few grounds that might be stuck inside the exit chute of the grinder. If I'm honest, it's a nice idea, but it doesn't work. And to explain how and why let's grind some coffee. Now, one quick thing early on people were concerned that the magnet at the bottom of this would interfere with the load cell of a nice weighing scale. That hasn't been the case for me though. It does stick and that's kind of annoying. Again, this position doesn't really its accuracy in terms of the scale. So I know that the weight is the weight. I'm not worried about that. But it is a slightly odd part of the experience when you're your beans bin and your scale of sort of stuck together. Coffee in. Now I'll push go. This grinder does have an auto off detection. You'll hear the coffee grind, and then you'll hear it run a little bit more then it should switch off pretty quickly after that. Coffee done. That took a little while. Now, generally speaking, it hasn't taken a long time. Let me just click my bag knocker and take this out. Generally speaking, it's maybe run four or five seconds over. And occasionally it has run a bit longer like that. The way that this is working is it sort of detecting resistance in the burrs. And so if a little bit of coffee is retained somewhere somehow, and it still feels a touch resistance. It'll keep trying to grind it through. So what we should have now is all of the coffee out, right? We put 15 grams in, we should have 15 grams out. That generally hasn't always been the case. Generally speaking there might've been a little bit of coffee retained. What you're starting to see right now, here is a bit of static issue, right? Quite a lot of chaff tends to end up all over the place. It's kinda messy on the lid here, as well as inside the beans cup as well. Now, these beans they might guide the coffee effectively, but they also trap it and hold it back a little bit too. And I find them a bit frustrating to use. So a nice pour, but obviously unless I keep shifting and changing the angles, it will retain some coffee in there. And as you can see, I give it a tap. There's just quite a lot of a static chaff around the place. The question is, did we get everything out of the grinder? If I go back and knock it now, if the knocker was effective, nothing should come out. That for me has been a consistent aspect of this grinder, just this retention of both chaff and some final grounds there as well in that kind of exit chute, and then knocker straight away, doesn't seem to be particularly effective if there is a bit of static electricity around to really help it cling onto the exit chute. You can go to Fellow's website and have a look at what they recommend and what pleases me in a funny sort of way is that they recommend checking out one of my videos on a quick technique to reduce static. And in that basically you just add a tiny droplet of water to your beans before you grind them. And that really does help mitigate static. So if you haven't seen this video, essentially get a teaspoon, get the handle a touch wet. Just adding that tiny, tiny droplet of water to the beans really can make a big difference. I mean that is very quick. Little slow to notice that it its empty though. Better than the last time. So that's usually about as much as it runs over. And honestly, I don't mind it running over a little bit because I'm usually doing other things in the coffee making process and not necessarily worrying about is the grinder shutting off by itself or not. If it shuts off five or 10 seconds after it finishes, that's fine by me. So we do still have a bit of static, some still inside here, but it's a bit better still some on the lid here. You can just see that this seems to just attract the chaff from the coffee beans in particular, but overall a slightly less staticky messy experience. Now this is a harsh environment to review a grinder in. We've got a dark worktop, a dark grinder. This one, to be honest though, is just a little bit messier than any of the other domestic grinders that I've used. It's notably, messier than say the Wilfa Uniform. I think it's messier than the Niche, but it's not the messiest grinder I've ever used by any stretch. Now I'm gonna brew some coffee next we talk about the burr set. Before I do that, I think this is a really important point. There was a lot of hype about this grinder. There was a lot of excitement about this grinder, and I think unfortunately, expectations have been set too high. Does this kind of meet people's expectations? That's a difficult question to answer. Is this grinder worth $300? Is there something better for $300 that does a better job? That's a different question to answer. It's not about the hype. It;s not about the excitement. It's not about the newness and the marketing campaign, all of that kind of stuff. Is it good value for money? And as I'm critical of this, you should know that I would be critical of other grinders at the same price point for similar things. Grinders like this tend to be a bit messy. Grinders like this tend to have a little bit of retention in their systems. This is not new or unusual. This is competitive, I think at its price point, but let's brew some coffee and talk about that a little bit more. Now just while the water heats I've weighed out 30 grams of coffee, I'm gonna brew a 30 to 500 pour-over. Now their range says, I really should be in the sort of four to five zone. And you would think a one cup pour-over would therefore be closer to four, maybe a two cup or three cups close to five, in my experience, this is way too coarse for the kind of roast that I'm typically working with. In fact for this, I'm gonna bring this down at sort of two on the grind dial here, which is a lot finer than they would typically recommend by this guide. But if I brew coarser in their range, the brew just happens very quickly. And you might think, oh does that mean less fines? No, not necessarily. It means the grind is just much coarser. So let's grind this at two. And let's say I put exactly 30 grams in. Coming out, 29.1 actually. So that suggests that there's quite a lot of ground still stuck in here. Yeah, there's a fair bit. There's a fair bit stuck inside. While this blooms, before reviewing this grinder, I put a kilo and a half through the finest setting. I then re-zero the burrs according to Fellow's instructions, because I thought that was a good point to test this grinder out. Brand new burrs do tend to produce a slightly different grind profile than burrs that have seen a little bit of usage. Sort of working burrs. For keeping score, I'm using the bagged Tara filters with the tab in case you wanna compare your brew times to mine. I'll let you know what the total drawdown time is here. And if you wanna know why filter coffee papers matter, there's a video up here too. So that's a 320 brew at the point that I'd finished drawing down the liquid and the bed went dry. That's not a particularly slow brew by any stretch for this kind of a pour, indicating that either there's no fines or less fines than you might expect, or that the grinders perhaps or acceptable, but almost it's still a tiny touch course. I should say, this should be pretty close. I'd be surprised if this isn't a tasty cup of coffee, but I would be thinking about brewing, maybe a touch fine the next time with this particular paper dose brew, kind of set up that I have here. While this cools, to speak to the brews that I've had from this grinder so far, I've had some very enjoyable brews of coffee. I haven't had a horrible taste profile from a poor grind distribution. It doesn't taste like it's producing a ton of fines or anything upsetting like that. It doesn't taste like this too many boulders or large pieces of coffee coming through. It tastes like it's doing a really very good job, grinding the coffee and certainly comparable to the best grinders in that price point. Now well that's still a little bit hot it's pleasant, but it is a little bit weaker, it's a little bit under extracted for me. I think I was right in that I would wanna go, the next time I brewed this, I would wanna go a little bit finer. This isn't the kind of brew where I wanna throw it in the sink and start again. And I'm cross, I would drink this in the morning and be like, man, it's tasty brew of coffee. It could just be to be a little bit more textured, a little bit sweeter, a little bit more complexity. It just says I've ground a little bit to coarse. And that is, I think one of the frustrations with this grinder. In that if I used darker roast, this might be true. But what is true in my particular world is that pour-over is actually finer than my cupping grind. We did the world's largest coffee tasting recently. There's sort of two here. Wouldn't be too far away from what we used for a cupping grind. My pour-over grind for a two cup is actually finer than that cupping grind. And if you still have your reference sample, it's not much finer, but it is a little bit finer. So for me, they're sort of setting you up to fail unless you're using more developed, darker roasted coffee. And that might be who they think their audience is. But amongst the people that I see be excited about this grinder, hopeful for this grinder. are a lot of people who like lighter roasted coffee. Now I brew a French press at the same grind setting that I brew a cupping at because they're the same brew method to me. This is the same kind of technique. Again, that's much finer than most people expect. Here for the French press, there is an enormous range, six through to 10, almost entirely dedicated to French press from Fellows perspective, but that is way, way coarse than anything I would use for a French press. Now I don't wanna get drawn to this too much. I presume that cold brew could work at nine through 11. And I presume they've made it go to 11 'cause they watched too much spinal tap as well. But for me, almost half of what this grinder can do, isn't usable grind size. I don't ever really need to go that coarse most of the time. And my usable ground size really is only this half of the dial, which for me is a frustration, especially because by the time you get down to one, I'm not sure if you bring a one cup V60 of light roasted coffee, I'm not sure that's fine enough. And how is that? Why is that? Why does this grind and not go as fine, especially when, as you adjust it, you can hear the burrs touch? And for that, we're gonna have to open up the grinder and talk about the decision they made around the burrs themselves. That is I think very interesting, but it has a massive impact on the capability and range of this particular grinder. If you wanna take apart the grinder, there are a few videos on Fellow's own website, showing you how to do this. Obviously unplug it. So to start with you just take off this front plate here. So if you take off the first four screws at north, south, east, west, that allows this place to come off, and that allows you then to get in and adjust and re-zero that front burrs position. This is something you might wanna do within the first month or two of owning the grinder. If you notice that it isn't going as fine as it used to. And there's a few more screws and we can access the burrs themselves. So this grinder is the moving burr here. It's driven by the motor and act against this stationary burr here at the back. You can see that the coffee exits out of this little chute here, and you can see actually this quite a bit of buildup here on the chute, which is not ideal. Now the design of these burrs, I think is very, very interesting. They look initially like regular flat burrs and the way that those work is that it's the gap between the burrs that determines the grind size. Here it's a little bit different. These teeth on the edge of this bur, stand up away from the cutting surface here. And this actually prevents the burrs from getting too close before they start to touch. They're called interlocking burrs. Because of the nature and the design of the cutting teeth here, you can't get the burrs any closer without them touching then produces actually a relatively coarse grind. With regular flat burrs, when they're almost touching that's when you're producing this super fine grind, this kind of espresso fine grind, or even finer sometimes, here this just isn't possible because the burrs will touch and contact and it can't be done. And that to me is a very interesting design decision because you can put regular flat burrs in here. In fact, people have already started changing the burr sets out on this. SSP a burr manufacturer from Korea produces burrs that fit this grinder that are brew focused, flat burrs. That will allow you to go much, much, much finer than the stock burrs would do. However, you'd be taking a $300 grinder and spending another $190 to upgrade it. In the future, I might look at that combination and how it fares out say $500 compared to other $500 grinders. But for now we're really reviewing this as a stock item. And so for me, I really don't understand the decision to go with interlocking burrs on this particular grinder. I did reach out to Fellow and ask them this particular question. At the time of recording, they hadn't come back to me, but if they do come back to me, I'll cut me in, telling you what they said. So right after we finished recording, I got an email from Fellow. They said they picked the interlocking burrs, one, because of grinder distribution. They looked at the kind of grind profiles from various burrs. They liked this one the best. And secondly, they did taste testing too. And again, they liked the interlocking set the best. They do acknowledge that it doesn't go super fine. And they said, they're gonna work on two new burrs that will be available to Kickstarter Backers at a deeply discounted rate. Coming in the future they will let you go, one to 200 microns finer. So just bear all this in mind as you watched the rest of the video. Now I will be doing one more video with this grinder before I give it away. I'll compare it to the Wilfa Uniform. And then the XeoLeo. I'm not sure about pronunciation actually. It's been hard to find out. A small ghost teeth grinder, the cost $130 from AliExpress. I'll put those three side-by-side 'cause I think they're an interesting combination in comparison of grinders at different price points with different availabilities. This grinder after that will be given away to one of my patron supporters. They give me a budget each month to go out and buy these things and review them. And I'm not relying on manufacturers freebies or loners. And I can give you an honest, unbiased review. And let's summarize the review of this thing here. It's $300. And I think that puts it in an interesting price point. From a features perspective, it's pactful. It's nice that it has an auto off I think that's good, even though it's not super, super accurate, that doesn't bother me. The design I think is beautiful. I think it's a lovely looking grinder. I think the footprint is fantastic. It is small. It is neat. It would look great in any kitchen. I think they've done great work with the design. I think the grind setting experience, the grinding experience is mostly good. It's a pretty messy grinder. I'd say it's a touch a messier than other grinders at that same price point. But they are not perfect by any stretch, but it is a little bit messy when it comes to static and chaff all around the place. So ultimately the thing for me, the deciding factor for you, if you're thinking about buying this is, does it grind and fine enough? And for me, if I'm honest, it doesn't. I want to go finer for a one cup pour-over than this would let me. I might wanna go finer for Aeropress for example, or even sometimes a mock-up on some cases, this doesn't let me do that. And that's frustrating. If I was brewing more developed coffees, darker roasts, I wouldn't have a problem, but I'm not. And bring pretty light roasts and trying to get the most complexity and sweetness out of them. That needs a fine grind. I think it has a lot of positives going for it. I think they've tried to pack it full of detail though it hasn't always, I think worked out as well as they might have hoped. There's tons of information from Fellow on their website about maintenance. It's pretty easy to get into, to look after, it's easy to upgrade the burrs inside it.", "videoID": "QE4NT8MY-Zo"}, {"title": "The Smart Espresso Profiler Review", "text": "This is the Smart Espresso Profiler. This is a very interesting little device, but it's actually not just a hardware thing, it's a hardware and software thing. Let me explain. This in my hand is a digital pressure transducer, that is Bluetooth enabled. That means it could send the pressure it was sensing to something like, I don't know, a smartphone. With the right software, you could read to that pressure and maybe do something cool with it. Let me give you some context as to how this works when it comes to espresso. So this I think is the brainchild of a guy called Gabor Laczko. He is a coffee roaster, he is a video maker, he's made some very cool stuff, I'll link down below, and he's also a lever head. He loves lever espresso machines. He wanted to have a way of tracking what was going on when you're pulling a shot, but it's not just Gabor, there's another person involved as well. One of Gabor's customers, a guy called Miklos Csanady, he's a software guy, and he got involved to write the software piece to go with the hardware. The idea is this: you can attach this thing to anything that generates pressure and you can connect it to your telephone. And at the same time, you can connect your phone to, say, an Acaia Pearl set of scales. And at this point, you could monitor, and potentially replicate, what you're doing in a lever espresso. There are two types of lever machines. There is the classic kind of spring type where pulling the lever down compresses the spring, and when you let go, the expansion of that spring generates the pressure. And then there's the second type of lever machine which is a much more direct thing where you pulling down on the lever actually generates the pressure. These are the kinds of things we've seen before like the Flair or the ROK or the Robot. These are all direct pressure manual lever machines and they're cool and they're fun, but it's difficult to really know what's going on. Even if you've got a gauge to be accurate and repeatable, that's really tough. Now, humans are good at some things and we're good at having fun making coffee but we're pretty terrible at pulling levers repeatedly. This might just be a solution to that problem. In order to explain it and demonstrate it, I'm going to need to make some coffee and I'm going to need a coffee machine to make it on. So let's grab one. What I have here is an Olympia Cremina. These are very cool little direct lever machines. They're a little bit culty, they're very cool, they're very beautiful as you can see. Now, Gabor very kindly modified this one for me so that I could use the Smart Espresso Profiler with it. Now there is going to be a review of this machine coming. It is going to be given away at the end of it, as always. Thank you to all the Patreon backers I have that allow me to go and buy this, review it honestly, and then give it away. These will actually be given away together because obviously this has been modified to work with this and it only seems fair that they go to a home together. Very simple, this just kind of screws in. And now we can turn this on and get it hot. We are on, we're ready to go, the machine is hot. It is time for us to pull some espresso. To do that, to use this thing, we've got to use our phone. So there's an app, it's a very nice app, if I'm honest, it's called the SE Profiler app. You can download it if you want to have a little look around. This is the main screen for it. And to get going, you would swipe, and then open up devices and make sure you were connected to your pressure transducer and also to your Acaia. I think at the moment only the Acaia Lunar I think is supported. It's a good little scale, it's expensive though, but this is about the best anyway. So here is your setup screen for what you're going to do. Right now, it's a blank template because right now I have no target profile set, but I can record one. So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to get some coffee. Now, this little thing, doesn't take a sort of huge dose. We're going to use 14 grams in here and I'm going to get 14 grams of ground coffee. And when you put your dose on the scale, and it says 14.1, in the app, I can set that as my starting dose. How very nice. So let's get ready to brew. Now, this is not going to be a perfect shot because I just want to talk you through how the app works. So I don't really care how this goes, but it'll be interesting. So, scale, cup, zero. Now, when I hit start, it will start logging both the weight here and the pressure at the sensor. Let's begin. Now with this machine, when you lift the lever, we're going to get a little pressure reading here. Now, as soon as I start to push down, you can see the pressure climb. Now a seated position is not the easiest position to produce a decent, you know, leverage, but here, you know, six bars I'm doing okay. And I can choose to gently ramp that down. I can see the mass in the cup climbing up, climbing up, climbing up, and I can see my brew ratio. I've hit the end there. Let the pressure dissipate naturally. And lo and behold, once it stops, I can hit stop. And there I have a profile. And I can see my brew time, I can see my pre-infusion, I can see my mass in the cup, I can see my brew pressure. Now, if this just so happened to be the best espresso of my life, which is, well I'm not going say likely, but it's not unlikely, it's not impossible, but let's say it is, well, I can save this profile, right? And I can look at my history and come in here and I can set, as a reference. This means if I want to replicate this exact shot, I would need the same grind, the same dose, all that kind of stuff. But I've got a template to work with. Should we see if I can do exactly the same thing again just for a bit of fun? So if I'm honest, that was not the greatest shot, but that's not the point right now. Let's go, let's replicate this thing. Here we go. Oh, I went early. Now the grind is just too course here, actually. But I can sort of reasonably accurately. Let's see if I can tail that down at the same time. And you can see my mass in the cup is trailing a little bit, but it's going to end up ultimately at the same weight, and surprisingly. There we go. So you can see my attempt, very quickly, at replicating a curve. Now, I'm not giving myself excuses, but it's not the easiest thing to do sitting down but that's not really the point. The point is I have, beautifully and simply, a lot of information about what's going on here. And that's really useful, that's really interesting. It makes this thing that is a little bit of a dark art, you know, how to really pull repeatable shots on a direct pressure lever machine. Well, it kind of opens that up. It makes it entirely possible. And what's more interesting is that I could put this same thing onto a Flair, and I could pull a shot on this thing, and then I could go and replicate, as closely as possible, the same pressures, the same mass in the cup, therefore the same kind of grind setting, on a whole other machine. Now it was actually John from Decent Espresso that put me on to them in the first place. And I think in future, there's going to be an integration between Decent Espresso machines and the SEP. I think the SEP software will ship on Decent tablets, but watch this space. I'm not going to say too much, but the possibilities get pretty exciting if you're interested in messing around with the way that pressure and flow and all that stuff interact inside one of these machines. Previously, I have made videos covering the software that goes with smart scales and I was not complimentary because it was all awful. It brings me a great deal of pleasure to use an app that is intuitive and beautiful, simple, presents all the information I need. I think this is a really well done app. I think they've done a fantastic job and they had to, really, because this setup is expensive. I think it's about $400. That is not a small amount of money. That's expensive, but if you've got one of these, if you spend a few thousand on something like this, well, for a small price in comparison, you get a whole new level of insight into what is going on and a whole set of tools around how to brew better espresso. Now, while the app is very simple, very intuitive, if you want to make it a more detailed logging experience, you can certainly do that. And you can start to log quite a lot of information about a roastery, about the beans, roasting date, description, color, operator. All of this stuff is there if you want to get super, super nerdy. If you really want to track all of this stuff, that's very easy to do. Now, for me, I don't want to log every detail. I'm happy with my weight in, weight out, brew time, brew pressures. If I want to set something as a reference curve, that's enough for me, I don't want to go crazy. But if you want it, it's absolutely there. So overall, I really like the app. I think having pressure to 0.01 of a bar with low latency is kind of amazing. I think the detail is wonderfully presented. I think they've done a really, a really good job. So overall I'm pretty impressed. I think it's pretty fantastic. I will say that I probably have a little bias in this because Gabor has been so helpful with everything from the beginning. And, you know, I kind of encountered his stuff before I really understood that he built the original pressure gauge for the Flair in my old review, but I just didn't really understand that connection and I messed that up quite badly, so apologies, very delayed apologies, but apologies for getting that so wrong. It's expensive, it's really well-made. Changing the battery on it is very simple. That's the only maintenance you would need to do to it. Installation on many things will be relatively easy. I think this is a great tool. I imagine myself, I see myself using this in a host of different applications and having some fun. And Gabor does cool stuff. And I would like to do some cool stuff with him in the future, so maybe we will. Watch this space. Now, as I said, this is not a review of this particular espresso machine. That is coming, I'm working on that. That will be after this, and these things in combination, this Profiler, this machine will be given away to somebody somewhere in the world who can use 230 volt power. And that will make me happy, but that's a future review. So once again, thank you to Patreons for supporting this channel, for giving me a budget to go and buy this stuff, and give you honest reviews. It's cool what you can do with it. I think there are a lot of users out there. If you are making manual espresso like this, in any form, I think it's worth considering if you want to dive deeper and understand more about what you're doing.", "videoID": "ckBWoRHkUZ4"}, {"title": "The Tricolate Vs The Next Level", "text": "Today, we're gonna be talking about two brewers and a new category of brewing called no bypass brewing. Now, if you're not familiar with no bypass brewing, don't worry, we will explain that very quickly. But let me introduce you to the two things that we're looking at today. We have the Tricolate brewer and we have the NextLevel brewer. There were no no bypass brewers for ages, and then suddenly there's two. It's a bit like when there's movies that seem to be the same movie but released at the same time, like movies about asteroids, or magicians, or volcanoes, or, you know what I'm talking about. But before we evaluate these two brewers, I do wanna get into the concept very quickly of no bypass brewing. What is it? Why is it important? Why should you care? Do you want another brewer in your life? It's a concept around pour over coffee. Now, if you take a traditional pour over cone like this one, when you brew a pour over with this, you have a bed of coffee at the bottom of the cone, you pour in water in the top, and most of that water flows through the bed of coffee, dragging with it the delicious soluble flavors down into the cup below. But some of the water finds it easier to kind of go sideways through the paper filter and around the bed of coffee because the coffee's providing quite a lot of resistance. That water doesn't really get involved in the brewing process, and we call that water bypass water. It's not huge issue. We should be aware of it. Our techniques should allow for it, but it it doesn't make it impossible to brew good coffee with a pour over brewer. But what if you didn't have bypass? That's the question that these brewers are trying to answer. And if more of the water went through the coffee, then you'd have more solubles taken out of the coffee down into the cup below. And so the idea behind no bypass brewing is to let you do a more effective and efficient extraction. You'll get more solubles out of your ground coffee. And that will also mean that the cup below would be comparatively stronger. You've got more stuff in that water. The cup's gonna taste stronger. There are other brewers that are zero bypass. An AeroPress press is zero bypass. Espresso is zero bypass. You have a kind of column of water passing through a puck or a bed of coffee. And that's the way that these are gonna work too. By not allowing the water to escape through the sides, by forcing it down through the coffee as the only escape route, you have this zero bypass effect. But if you make a coffee with an espresso machine or an AeroPress, you know that water without a little encouragement doesn't really wanna go through the coffee bed. You've got to add some pressure. Otherwise, it takes a really long time. And that's part of brewing with these brewers. All the things you think about with brew time are gonna go out of the window. Here, your brews may take anywhere from five minutes up to 10 minutes in some cases. So if you're in a rush, that might disqualify these brewers straight away, but don't throw them out just yet because the coffee you get by extracting more does taste different. It doesn't just taste stronger, it tastes different. 'Cause if you take a sort of a high extraction brew and you just dilute it back to normal strength, it doesn't taste identical with a normal, traditional kind of pour of a brew. So you have to first decide, do you want this new style of coffee? Not that you have to do that. I will say these brewers allow you to brew lower extraction yields if you want to, but the kind of the trick of them, the unique part of them is that they let you brew these higher extractions. So if you look at each of these brewers, you'll see that their approach to the problem is pretty much identical. Now, the Tricolate, I think, is the earlier brewer. I think it started development in 2018, I heard about it in 2020, and I heard about the NextLevel brewer here in 2021. And pricing wise, they're both around 50 to 60 US dollars, depending on where in the world you are, and shipping and all the rest of it. But the way they work is simple. You will have in the bottom here a filter bed where your paper will go, and you'll put your coffee on top of the filter paper and make it nice and even. And then you'll put these little shower screens on top, pour water on top, and they will help distribute the water evenly across the coffee bed. And that column of water will build up and then drain down. They're kind of the same, but they have a couple of key differences that will really inform which one of these might be the best for you. So what we'll do now is brew some coffee with them, and then we can drink some coffee, talk about the high extraction yield stuff, talk about the sort of nitpicks of these brewers, and then at the end of it, you'll know if you need one of these in your life. And if you do, which one fits you. Now, I'll start with the Tricolate first, and I'm gonna brew differently in each one for a reason. The kind of philosophical idea behind each brewer is slightly separate. If you look at the kind of way that they want you to use their brewer, then Tricolate are pushing one particular angle a little harder. The idea, basically, you can use and should use way less coffee. So instead of using 60 grams a liter that you might use in a pour over, here, we're gonna use 45 grams per liter. That's the kind of big selling point. If you think about how much coffee you might save over the course of a year by dropping from 60 grams a liter to 45, then you can pretty quickly work out that you might save the cost of the brewer within 150 or 200 cups, depending on the cost of your coffee. Now, the construction of the brewer is very simple. You have this base piece that does actually come out like that and sort of snaps back into place. You don't really need to take it out other than for cleaning occasionally, but you absolutely wanna make sure it's locked back in properly. To get a filter paper in there, so you just drop one in the top. This whole process might require slightly more patience than I sometimes have, if I'm honest. And then you would want to rinse the paper once it's settled at the bottom, and make sure that it is properly seated right in the middle, and all the edges are nice and flush. So I've got 15 grams of coffee here. I'm gonna grind it relatively finely. Finer than I would grind for a pour over quite substantially, but not espresso fine, but certainly much finer than pour over. And I'll be brewing, in total, about 333 grams of water into that. With both of these brewers, you have to be quite thoughtful about prepping the bed of coffee before you brew. It needs to be as level and even as possible. If you've got a very fancy grinder, life's probably all well and good, but with cheaper grinders, because you're grinding that bit finer, clumping may be an issue. And so I would recommend potentially, getting out your little WDT tool, if you have one of those, just to declump your coffee before you brew it if your grinder does kick out some clumps at these finer grind settings. Now, I've seen recipes for the Tricolate that go as low as 10 or 12 grams of coffee. And that's interesting, that's a good thing. That's a very shallow bed. And the way that you're gonna deal with this will very slightly depending on the bed depth. You wanna kinda mess with it less the thinner the bed is, generally speaking. Here, we have a sort of small to medium bed of 15 grams. And for 15 grams, I'm gonna add about 45 grams of bloom water. A very gentle swirl to mix. Wait 30-35 seconds, and then I'm gonna add the rest of the brew water. And then once that's added, one more gentle swirl. And I will say the nice thing about both of these brewers is that you don't need a fancy pouring kettle. You can just use a regular kettle if that's what you have at home. But what you can quite clearly see is a bed of coffee at the bottom and a column of water above it. And that's just gonna move down and through. And that's gonna take a while. This brew might take five, five and a half minutes to complete. And so while it's doing that, we may as well talk about the next brewer. So the next level encourages you in a different route around your brewing. It says grind 30 grams, so like a much bigger dose as your sort of recommended dose. And grind a little coarse than you would do here. The goal actually is to use less water in the brew, so we're gonna brew half a litter, but only about 360 grams of the water, maybe 370, are gonna go through the coffee. And because that gives us a higher yield, but we stop earlier, we'll get pretty close to a kind of normal extraction of 20-21%. And we'll just dilute that down to kind of normal drinking strength afterwards. So it's a philosophically very different approach. You can brew identically to this, right? You can brew finer, higher yields, you know, do all of the same sort of stuff here, but it just seemed worth brewing the way they encourage you to brew to kind of compare and contrast. So prepping this brewer is a little bit different. So this, this sort of side walls of the brewer actually come off, and then you're gonna place your filter on top of that. And then you're gonna give it a little rinse. Then you're gonna put the brewer together. And then we add the coffee. And now, this is quite a bit coarser. This is close to where I would grind for a two cup pour over, which is what they recommend. The interesting implication is that I'm gonna use 25% less water, so to get the same extraction, does that imply that a V60 has about 25% bypass? Maybe, if you're wondering why this is suddenly brewed and this took me so long, there's a reason for that. I too constantly wonder if I've had too much or not enough caffeine. So a really very similar process, boiling water, three times the weight. So we're gonna do a 90 gram bloom, give it a gentle swirl. And then after a short bloom phase, we're gonna get up to about 380 grams of water, maybe 370. The rest will add in the brew afterwards. In all brewing, excessive agitation seems to cause some clogging, so you kinda wanna do the least possible agitation to get what you want at the end, which is a flat bed of coffee. And I will say, with both of these brewers, if you have an obsession around flat beds with pour over brewers, that kind of gets worse with these, where you really interrogate the flatness of everything. Obviously, to have these be leveled when you're brewing is really important, that will help you get a flat bed. So, you know, just be mindful of your setup. You know, don't have things at an angle. Make sure everything's put into place properly. That stuff does have a noticeable impact on taste. Undrinkable. So your bed at the end should be relatively flat even you shouldn't have too much kind of stuff to freak out about with the Tricolate. Give it a knock, and most of it comes out pretty cleanly. You'll then need to rinse this stuff out, pop out the base if you wanna do that, but to clean, fine, not incredible, but perfectly fine. The next level encourages you to take off this piece before knocking out, like so. You still need to clean this. That doesn't shortcut that part of the process. And then this should knock out relatively easily. You'll see that this is a white piece here, and it's slightly kind of porous as a material, which means that you do get some staining and discoloration with the white version of this brewer. It's kind of a weird choice. You can get aggressive in the cleaning and sort of undo a bit of that, but over time, this will certainly stain and discolor. Now, I owe this brewer another about 120 mils of water. So now we've got two similar cups of coffee in terms of strength, but very different cups in terms of extraction. Here, low dose, high extraction to get to our kind of normal strength of filter coffee. And here, we had that high extraction, but with less water, and then some bypass sort of done separately to get us to a normal strength from a normal dose. So this is the kind of more unusual cup, that kind of high extraction yield. Typically, this coffee and this setup has been extracting 24 to 25%, sometimes a little bit more. And here, a kind of normal brew achieved in an unusual way. And it's interesting in that they have similar strength and in some ways similar texture. Here, it feels like there's a lot more going on, but to the point that it feels a bit like a crowded room sometimes. You don't have the kind of clarity, starting to get into pretentious words here, but kind of clarity of acidity or of some of the flavors, but you get a lot of texture in an interesting way, and you get a lot of flavor, it's just harder for me to pick it apart. In the lower extraction brew, you maybe miss out on a little bit of sweetness, you miss out on a little bit of texture, but what's there kinda has a bit more space, and that's pleasant. And I think it certainly suits some coffees more than others. I will say now, and I think this is important, that I think you could achieve broadly the same extractions with both brewers, right? If you started with the same coffee, I'm not sure if you got them both to 23 and a half percent, I'm not sure I could taste the difference between which one was which. You know what I mean? I think they brew in a technically, very, very, very similar way. You could have made this cup with this brewer and vice versa. Let's get to summarize before I talk too much. The fundamental difference between the two of them seems a little simplistic, but it's ultimately size. This is a bigger brewer, and that changes the use cases for it compared to this brewer. Because what attracts me to higher extraction yields are the efficiencies of it, right? And there's certainly times when I've got maybe 12 grams of coffee left at the bottom of a bag, with this brewer, I can just make a bigger cup of coffee with it quite easily. I probably couldn't get 12 grams to work as easily in a brewer like this. But if I need to brew larger volumes of liquid, this is a better brewer. If I'm brewing for two thirsty people, this maybe isn't as well-suited to that as the NextLevel. In terms of design, I enjoy some aspects of the NextLevel more. It feels a little bit more premium, aside from the fact that it does discolor. I like the idea of kind of pulling the brew chamber off to make sure that the paper is seated first, and then placing the chamber on top. Sort of dropping the paper into here, potentially using the back of a spoon to poke it around, as they recommend, if it's not quite seated, is a less joyful experience. Now, both brewers can feel a little bit finicky. That's kind of a shared attribute of these kind of no bypass brewers. They feel frustrating sometimes in that the brews can be quite slow, and you'll have maybe waited four and a half minutes to work out that your grind isn't entirely where you want it to be, as it's either finished, or is nowhere near finished at that point. They're slow enough that I don't wanna reach for them every single day, but I do think they're interesting options to have around as part of your kind of brewer collection. I think there are certain coffees that lend themselves better towards these high yield things. I think coffees with tons of sweetness that aren't overly developed in the roast do better. And the more developed coffee is in the roast, the kind of lower overall extraction I'd be aiming for. Now, it interests me that the recommended dose here is about 30 grams, because if you take the diameter of the sort of brewer and scale that dose down to this, well, that's like a 20-ish gram dose on this brewer, which, you know, they claim to be able to brew half that amount. So I don't know, you know, with a bit of skill and effort if you could get good results from smaller doses, but I think in both cases, the thinner the bed, the harder it is to get a very even result, not to have channeling issues, not to have it be a bit of a finicky, fussy experience, especially when you wanna be manipulating those, swirling those less with those kinda smaller doses. Now, what we haven't done today in this video is get into recommended techniques. Is there a perfect way of using these? That isn't really something I wanted to address in this video. I wanted to kind of cover the concepts of no bypass, to look at these two brewers in a kind of objective way. There are recommendations on YouTube. I'll leave some links to both the official ones and some other creators who have some interesting recipes and ideas around these brewers should you want to explore them further. As for which one I would pick, kind of both or neither. I sort of want a hybrid of the two to exist. I want some of the sort of design features and ease of use around this incorporated into this. Probably closer to this in size. I just want the kind of paper bit of this to be slightly more joyful, and it to feel maybe a little bit more premium. It's not bad in its construction and it's a good food safe plastic, but it just doesn't quite have the kind of premium feel of this. Though saying that they do do other colorways of the Tricolate. They have this kind of nice orangey one. They do a kind of very blue one that's kind of intense.", "videoID": "4l_h2D8fJTU"}, {"title": "A Ridiculous 1 MILLION subscriber giveaway", "text": "This channel has 1 million subscribers, and honestly, that's kind of mind blowing to me. And so to celebrate, I thought it would be fun to give away 1 million coffee beans... Which is a lot of coffee beans, but also maybe not a lot of coffee beans. And if you want to win some of them, not all of them, 'cause no one gets all of them, but you can have some of them if you win, then I'll tell you about that a little bit later in the video. First, I want to talk just briefly, briefly about this, the state of things, the complete incomprehensibility of the size of this channel at this point and what's happened. Because I set out years ago, and actually there's a video, it's about five years old now, end of 2016, talking about why I was making videos and what I wanted to do. And my point was, I don't want to get into television because you end up making kind of watered-down, mass appeal stuff. Instead, YouTube was exciting because it let me communicate with people who were interested, and what I wanted to do was make videos for people who are interested, and hopefully if I did good work, I would find them. Those are kind of my words from when I started out. And I vastly underestimated the number of people that were interested in being a weird coffee person, a little bit like me. That was never on the cards. You know, that seemed impossible. I remember hitting a hundred thousand and people were like, \"On to 1 million!\" I'm like, \"I'm not sure there's enough humans who are into it that much.\" And I was wrong. I don't know if there's another million. I don't really want to live subscriber count to subscriber count. That's not really the point, but a million seems like a good moment to stop and be like, thank you. This is amazing and unexpected and wonderful. I kind of have this job making videos now. Obviously what I'm gonna make in the future is gonna be different from what I made in the past. Firstly, I'm trying to get better. I'm trying to improve. That's practice. It takes time. And I want to make interesting, valuable coffee videos, entertaining coffee videos, but that's kind of it. That's the plan for the future. And I think they're probably going to get a bit weirder. I think I have grand ambitions and for some reason now, just the means and the confidence and just the, whatever, determination to make more interesting and unusual stuff. That doesn't mean there's gonna be no more reviews or no more techniques. I still want to make that stuff. It's useful. I hope you'll come along and watch some fun stuff. I feel like I'm being cryptic. I feel I could also do a bad job of explaining what I have planned. So I'll just do it and we'll see how that goes. Okay, back to the 1 million coffee beans, which I don't know if you've done the maths in the meantime, I think it's around about, it's between a hundred, 150 kilos, which is, I don't know if that's more than you thought or less. I'm gonna give away about 150 kilos, maybe a little bit more, of coffee. Now I did work with Jamie, who's the buyer at Square Mile, to help find a lot of coffee. This was kind of all of the farm's production. So there's a really small producer in Mexico called Esteban Garcia, who's near Oaxaca, but really remote, and Square Mile bought the entirety of the exportable production, and I'm buying it from Square Mile so that I can give it away. So the only way that you can drink this coffee is if you win a bag this year, that's it. I'm buying all of it and I'm giving it away. And I'll ship it to anyone who wins, anywhere in the world that I can ship coffee to. Sadly, that isn't every single country, but I'll have a go. And we've also had some artwork made to kind of celebrate this ridiculous milestone. And you'll get a little postcard from me in there as well. And if we can't ship coffee to people, maybe we'll send a bunch of extra postcards out too, because that would be fun. Now to win, you don't have to do any hoop jumping. You don't have to subscribe or promote the channel in any way. All you have to do is commit and promise me that if you win a bag, you will share some of that coffee with another person. You can brew a cup of coffee for someone in your house. You can give 20 grams of coffee beans to a friend who's into coffee, but I want you to promise me that you will share your winnings. That's the deal. You can enter at the link down below. It's really simple and good luck to you. I think I'm gonna send out at least 600 bags of coffee around the world, because I'm very grateful.

The dark, bitter, low quality coffee, or is it really? Hi, my name is Rodrigo Torii. I'm a roaster, photographer, and video producer based in Brazil. I've been roasting here in Manaus for a couple of years now, and since the beginning, I was looking for a good quality, locally-produced coffee. You see, generally speaking, robustas aren't praised by its quality. You often find it pre-ground and overly roasted. In the cup, you taste leathery and ashy notes. By treating it as a commodity, this stigma is created. However, with proper care and handling, the results can be incredibly good. When a friend showed me this Amazonian robusta, I knew that something was different. The espresso is balanced with nice sweetness and a touch of acidity, much different than I was used to. But at the same time, James has just posted his guest creator takeover, so I thought, \"Yeah, this is it.\" So I pitched the idea to investigate further and oh my god, he approved!  After a quick trip to Cacoal in the state of Rond\u00f4nia, I've managed to talk to a couple of local producers and also with a researcher from Embrapa in Porto Velho. Here's what I've discovered. Number one: you cannot expect a good quality coffee if you don't treat it right. Ever since I've heard about quality coffee, canephoras were treated as commodity, as inferior. So investment and research throughout the whole chain is essential. Number two: now that you have a good foundation, one way to enhance the experience is through different post-processing methods. Here's where the magic happens. Remember that coffee that I've talked about in the beginning of the video? It went through a semi-carbonic maceration, which is much simpler than the name suggests. After picking and washing the fully ripe cherries, you put them whole in a clean, sealable plastic drum with a one-way valve on the top. The key here is not to let any more air enter the system, only exit. So, in the beginning there is still plenty of oxygen inside the reservoir. But as the fermentation occurs, the CO2 produced expels the oxygen, creating an anaerobic environment. At the bottom of the tank, cherries get squeezed by the weight of the cherries above. In the top layer of the tank, cherries get only fermented. This mixture of processes creates complex flavors, bringing more acidity, herbal, and fruity notes. However, it is important to don't overdo it. Controlling the temperature and the time of fermentation is crucial here. Also, opening the lid in the middle of the process is a no-go. Over-fermented coffees are very unpleasant and that's why it's super important to follow the protocols. So, by implementing a simple process with simple tools, producers in the middle of the Amazon forest and anywhere in the world, now have another way of presenting their coffee with high added value. By investing in quality and post-processing, we'll ensure the preservation of the Amazon because there is no need to deforest. Robustas have a high productivity, so farmers only need a small piece of land to make a good living. I'll be interested in hearing your thoughts, though. Is there a place for a good quality, nicely-produced robusta in the world? Or is it just nonsense? The future should be 100% arabica? Is fermenting bad? Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. - In my opinion, I think very well-controlled fermentation processes should definitely be widespread throughout the country, especially because there's still so much for us to discover in terms of potential for Brazilian coffees. - What is happening right now, especially with producers in Espirito Santo producing canilon and in Rond\u00f4nia producing robustas, is that they woke up for quality and they are making some experiments and the results, I am just in awe with beautiful coffees that I am trying so far. - Do I love canephoras? No, I don't. Do I love the fact that we can push quality harder with them? Yes, I do. And that's actually why we have one of them here at the Coffee Lab. We roast a very good lot of conilon, which is the varietal here in Brazil. It's washed, it's fruity, it's weird, compared to arabicas. And I like the fact that this canephora doesn't try to be arabica. I've tried so many, since 2000 I guess, so many canephoras around the world and some of them try to be arabicas and I don't think that's the way. So, that's it. I like having the possibility to show quality either way, arabicas or canephoras.", "videoID": "qiwccma8Hs"}, {"title": "How To Dial In A Bean To Cup Machine (Like A Nerd)", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about getting the best results that you can dialling in a bean to cup machine, a little domestic, super automatic. How can you get the best tasting coffees at the end of it? These things make a particular promise. They say, \"just put water in, just put beans in, push a button. It's all taken care of.\" But if you've bought one of these and you've tried to put specialty coffee into them, you might have been frustrated because specialty coffee is kind of like the final boss of coffee brewing. It's generally light roast. It's generally dense high-grown coffees and those are more difficult to extract. And these machines are not necessarily built for those kind of coffees. And so the promise of \"it's easy\" might have led you to try and tweak and dial in and become incredibly frustrated with these things. Now, the reason I've got six of them here is I'm working on a comparison review. It'll be out very soon, but while they were here, it seemed a good idea to share what I've learned from brewing with them and how I would recommend you approach dialling in especially for specialty, even though these techniques will work, whatever coffee you are using to give you, what I think, can be a really delicious cup of coffee. Let's start by talking about why these things are kind of difficult when it comes to brewing real espresso. Now, the way these machines brew coffee is actually surprisingly similar across the board, the base kind of underlying mechanism. If I open this up, I can show you what I mean. The way that these things generally work is that you have a chamber that we're gonna grind into. Your grinder is gonna sit right above this here and funnel ground coffee in. When it's hit the dose that it has specified, it's usually a time-based grind on these things, this little chamber will move around, so that that puck of coffee gets pushed across and then lifted up, let me get that there, against the kind of brewing chamber. So now it's in brewing mode and it's gonna pull that shot. Now, if you've been making espresso with a traditional machine, you would know that it's important to prep the puck, tamp the puck, in order to have an even extraction, that's really fundamental to espresso. And the problem with these machines is that there's no real puck prep. And so what happens is, you typically get quite an uneven extraction and you're gonna end up fighting that mechanism. If you try and put a very fine grind of coffee, as you would use for espresso, into one of these brew groups, generally the puck prep isn't good enough and the water will just find a way around the coffee and it won't extract most of the coffee properly. So confusingly, with these things, you actually have to go a little bit coarser. We'll talk about dialling in the grind in just a second in machines that let you do that. But it's important to understand here that we're fighting uneven extraction first and foremost, and so grind isn't always gonna be our friend. Getting more extraction through grinding finer is not often the solution to our problems. Now this is well known in the world of espresso. This was actually diagnosed by a sort of scientific paper that I made a video about a while ago. And you might have heard of turbo shots. I'll leave a link to, I think Lance Hedrick's video is very good. I'll leave a link to that if you wanna know more about turbo shots in the world of regular espresso, but those are the kind of ideas we're gonna be applying to these machines. Let's start with the first of the step by steps. In step one, you need to work out how much coffee you're using. So what we're gonna do is actually take out the waste tray for the machine. And all machines have different waste trays. This one is where the grounds end up. So what we're gonna do, we're gonna put it on a scale, zero it out, and then we're gonna put it back in and we're gonna make the machine brew. Now we don't want to weigh the wet, spent puck, that's not actually useful. That will be missing some coffee that will have gone into the cup and also it'll be full of water. So we don't know what the grounds' weight is. We need the un-brewed weight. So first thing, set the machine to kind of maximum strength rating. It'll be little bean symbols or something like that. You want that at max to know how much coffee is the maximum you can brew with and then you're gonna brew a drink. And then Just after it finishes grinding, cut the power. This means that ground coffee will never be brewed. When I turn the machine back on, it will go through its reset process, it moves the little brew chamber around through all the positions as part of that, thus dumping out the ground coffee, un-brewed, into the little collection box. And yeah indeed. So you can see here, we've got ground coffee, un-brewed. This thing produces about 13 grams of ground coffee at maximum dose. And that's good to know, that's useful to know. Now some machines won't let you do this properly. It's kind of annoying. What you'll need to do there, is actually weigh the entire brew group and same thing, interrupt just after grinding and pull the brew group out again. And you'll see it's got ground coffee in the top and you can weigh that. This is just a little bit easier, but it's a really important thing to know right at the beginning to help develop a good recipe and to get the best out of your machine. Know though, that across the machines I've tested so far, doses have ranged anywhere from 8 grams to 16 grams. So there's a big variance and that's why it's important to measure right at the start. Now we're gonna try and figure out our ratio. Now this machine dose is a little heavier. Max is about 15, 16 grams. I'd recommend like a four to one starting ratio with these machines. You may change that, one way or the other, but four to one is a good place to start. Many machines, and this one included, will let you choose the milliliters, but don't always believe them. What I would recommend doing is aiming for 60 mls, which is what we have programmed here, but weigh the output because it's what's in the cup that counts. You want that to weigh four times the ground coffee dose weight. So here we've got 58.5 grams, which is actually pretty good. Really this stage is to try and understand what the machine is actually giving you, versus what it says it gives you. Most of them will let you adjust the amount of output by five mls at a time. So you kind of wanna adjust it until you get what you want and kind of ignore, to some extent, what many of them say. This one though, really pretty close, which is good. Now you can at this stage, give what you've got a little taste. That's no bad thing. It'll give you a pretty good idea of where you are in this whole process before you begin to make any other adjustments. Now, even if you're not a straight espresso drinker, taste is gonna be your guide today. I have lots of other tools and things like that that I can use to assess coffee. Most people at home don't. This is not similar to a real espresso. It's a strong coffee with crema on top, but it's not real kind of true espresso. It's not strong enough. We can't use a fine enough grind. What we're chasing here is a feeling of balance. There might be some acidity, but you want it to be balanced. You want a nice clean aftertaste, no excessive bitterness, no real obvious flaws. It will taste strong if you don't drink espresso regularly, but it should taste pleasant, clean, enjoyable. This particular espresso is pretty good but I actually think it's just a little bit under extracted. And I know that because it's just a little bit sour. Many people would want to reach for the grind setting which takes us to a discussion about what you should do about the grind setting with your machine. Not every machine actually has a grind adjuster. If yours doesn't, don't worry too much. It actually makes the process simpler. If yours does, it's generally in the bean hopper at the back of the machine. The range of grind settings across different machines is kind of huge. You might be surprised if you look at a spent puck and see that the coffee feels very coarse, that's pretty normal. Some machines, the finest grind setting is still nowhere near espresso. And some it's actually pretty close to espresso. You do not want a very fine grind setting. Finer than an AeroPress just, but not that much finer, like Moka Pot fine, in some cases, may be too fine for some of these machines. So, surprisingly coarse. It is what it is. I wish they could work a little finer, they can't and so, wherever possible, I'd avoid using the grind setting. You want to go as fine as you can without beginning to have any interruptions to flow. If you see any kind of drip, drip, dripping in the flow, if you see kind of interruptions to the flow, that's generally bad. If you see a flow that starts very slow and suddenly gets very quick, that's very bad. The taste of a channelled brew with these things is a weird combination of it being quite weak, very harsh, very smoky, very kind of bitter, but also not very strong and also a little bit acidic too. It's not a good cup. It's to be avoided. So generally, maybe one step finer than the factory, two steps finer than the factory at most, but really going very fine on these things does not yield great results. And now the process is pretty simple. You've got your grind pretty close to where you need it to be, we're just gonna use ratio. Each time you brew, increase the amount of liquid used by five mls, have a taste, you'll see an increase in sweetness. an increase in clarity, increase in balance, a decrease in acidity until suddenly you hit a wall of bitterness. And that's the point where you've got everything you want and just a little bit more. So you wanna go back five mls to where you were previous to that, and at that point you're getting maximum extraction from the ground coffee that you're using. As an espresso, it might be a little bit lacking in terms of texture, it'll taste weak. It's probably half the strength of a traditional espresso and more akin to the espresso you might get from a little pod, but if you're gonna turn it into another kind of drink, getting the good solubles out of the ground coffee is fundamentally the most important thing. They're gonna get diluted down anyway by hot water, by milk or a milk alternative, so getting the flavors is the number one priority. Now I did talk about diluting things down, I do quickly wanna touch on pretty much every machine having kind of a long coffee option. It might be 120 mls, it might be more than that, 200, 300 mls, generally speaking, I would say we've worked hard to get a good tasting extract that's like an espresso. Just dilute that with fresh hot water. Some machines will let you tap off hot water, other's won't, some will do some fancy bypass brewing, others won't, some will try and adjust the grind setting for longer coffees and change the dose and all of that stuff. Start with the good espresso thing that we made. Dilute it with water from a kettle, water you boiled on the stove, if you want the best possible results. This liquid here does not taste good, I don't want it in my drink. A few closing thoughts and tips and tricks and stuff. If you're brewing specialty coffee, make sure you adjust the brew temperature. The factory defaults are often set quite low, set it to maximum temperature. For more developed roasts, yeah, you could probably get down to a 3:1 ratio and have a good extraction, but for lighter roasts, I've yet to find a machine for home that effectively does a good job below a 4:1 ratio. If you are just too frustrated by the drink, being that little bit too weak for your tastes, yeah, sure. Go a little bit finer and start the process again. Start back at three to four to one, somewhere in that range, and work your way through the extraction again. But chances are, you're gonna need that bigger beverage to get a good extraction. None of these machines can brew very fine grounds well. I know I keep saying that, they'll often let you load ground coffee into them. I wouldn't load proper espresso grounds into them.", "videoID": "J6yWOyNq0uw"}, {"title": "How to Make Coffee Without Coffee Equipment", "text": "Today, we're gonna get you out of an imagined coffee emergency. You're gonna MacGyver your way out of not having a grinder or a brewer of any kind. If you don't know who MacGyver is, then I'm both appalled and a little bit excited for you. We're gonna split this up into two parts. We're gonna have a kind of grinding section, and then we're gonna have kind of a brewing section. So we're gonna work on the idea that you are somewhere and you have a bag of beans, but you've got no grinder, no hand grinder, no nothing, no way of grinding them that is designed to grind coffee. How are we gonna overcome that problem? And I have four competing solutions here. We have the classic of the genre. We have a hammer. Now a hammer seems a bit brute force, but as an idiot once said, \"With sufficient violence, just about anything can be a coffee grinder.\" So we're gonna beat some coffee into little tiny pieces, and we'll see how that works. Now, this might seem very similar to the pestle and mortar, which is our next choice here, but the pestle and mortar has the bash bash, but you've also got the kind of a rolling grinding thing, which will grind quite differently and we'll see how that does. Then we're just gonna take to it with a nice sharp knife, right? We're gonna just chop as if we're kind of chopping chocolate or something like that. Chop it down to the finest pieces we can. I expect this to be a miserable experience, even with a nice knife. And then maybe you've got a pepper grinder. Now this theoretically is well in the lead, right? It's got a conical burr set inside it that looks identical to a coffee burr set. To disadvantage it fairly, I'm gonna take the pepper out the tin here. You know, I'll get rid of that. But - and I'll grind through anything that's in the burrs, but I'm not gonna wash it or anything like that. I'm gonna see what the contamination is like. And to compare these, we're gonna take 10 grams of coffee and grind them with each of our options to see which is the best. Now, at this point, you might be like, \"Why are you doing this?\" And that's a good question. You should always ask that question. Really it's because I do videos on like, how to get the best out of a cheap blade grinder, or how to get the best out of a cheap coffee brewer. And still there are comments of like, \"Yeah, but what if I don't even have those? How do I make coffee then?\" I'm gonna presume you can heat water 'cause if you can't heat water, I can't help you make hot coffee. So I'm gonna work in the idea that you have some way, you have a stove or something or a microwave or something to make water hot. And then, second half we'll talk brewing. Now you can see I've got a little sieve here. I've got myself a tea towel, that's gonna be good. I do also have some kitchen roll, which is going to be our friend later today, I hope, we'll see. Maybe it's good for brewing, maybe it's not. We are gonna be doing filtered coffee for reasons we'll talk about later. I'm gonna weigh out 10 grams of coffee, four times for these four methods. I am gonna use a weighing scale for science. When we brew, I'll maybe be a little freer, and you know, overcome my deep seated fear of brewing without a scale, but let's get to grinding of a sort. So first contender is the hammer. This is gonna go badly. Safety first. I'm gonna try and be gentle. This is so stupid. So this is about as joyless as you'd expect. I have no idea how much coffee is actually gonna, you know, make it to the end, but my 11 grams that I started with is going to be less. So I'm gonna put the coffee into the cupping bowl, we're gonna cup it later. Ooh, there's some fine ground stuff here. That's kind of surprising. When it comes time to brew this, there might be some flavor extracted. I'm gonna be honest with you. I've given up after like three minutes of just hitting things with a hammer. The joy level was very low and the quality of grinding also very low, so it's not looking like we're going strong out of the gate here. So next up we have 10 grams of coffee into our pestle and mortar. I'm hopeful. Let's see what happens. Satisfaction level already much higher, and I probably don't need the safety glasses anymore. So far so good, actually. I'm gonna go a bit finer, but impressed so far. Obviously coffee has a history of pestle and mortars used for grinding. If you think about Ethiopian coffee ceremony, for an example, that's a pretty good example of this technology for grinding, so much better than the hammer. I've never done this before. Maybe lots of people have, but I am having a nice time. Into a cupping bowl and onto the next challenge. We're gonna chop coffee into little pieces and might be the stupidest way I'm gonna make a knife blunt in my life. Let's find out. Should I wear the safety glasses again for safety? Safety first. You know, it's important. There's gonna be exploding beans again. So, you know. Aw, straight in the face. First one, like right in the face, okay. Not gonna lie, the sound is actually really quite pleasing. I'm making a mess. So we finished with the knife. I've given up. It's not a good job. There's big pieces. There's little pieces. I'm just done with that experience. It was satisfying in the crunchiness, but not satisfying in the fact that coffee went just like everywhere, like everywhere, it's under my feet right now, it's awful. So pepper mill should have the advantage going in 'cause it's, you know, it's a ceramic burr set. Don't know how the grind setting's gonna be. It's a very nice pepper in there. However, probably gonna cause me some pain when it comes to tasting this. I don't know if it's gonna grind coffee well, but we are gonna find out. Come on. Will you grind? I mean, it's definitely working. I'm gonna be here a long time. I'm gonna call this a fail. I just can't get the beans to feed into the grinder on this thing. Obviously it's designed for peppercorns, which are much smaller. So after a lot of grinding, my yield is not very much. That's like a lot of grinding to get here. Now the grind quality, yeah, it looks pretty good. You know what I mean? I'm not gonna lie. That looks pretty good, but it really smells like pepper. I'll brew it. I'll put a little water on it and see what happens, but I think it's just not practical. If it can't grind coffee, it can't grind coffee. And if I had a pepper grinder that didn't have pepper in it, that did accept bigger things, that would be a coffee grinder and that would be cheating. I feel like there's a strong leader here, but let's get some water on these, have a little taste, and see what's going on. Oh, this looks so bad. This is looking good. This is back to looking like soup, and yes, yes, coffee is a soup. Oh, I can smell that pepper. Such an idiot. These are cooled enough to taste, and it just, it feels like a given to be honest, but let's try the hammer. Just weak bean soup. The pestle and mortar. Let's not pretend it's flawless. It's kinda got a dusty harshness to it, but it's got coffee flavor. That's workable, I can work with this. The knife, the beautifully cut, beautifully sliced coffee. Worse than the hammer. Worse than the hammer. Not even the fines to make up some extraction. Now my most feared bowl, the pepper grinder. Oh, ooh, plenty of pepper in that still. Do not recommend at all. 100%, if you're thinking about using your pepper grinder, just wash it or something. I don't know, but don't, if it's had pepper in it, you're gonna have a bad time. The comfortable winner, the pestle and mortar as has been used for centuries in Ethiopia, but you know, still works pretty well in a pinch. So now we're gonna take the pestle and mortar forwards to the next stage. We're gonna talk about brewing, but we're gonna do that after a short ad for this video's sponsor, which is Surfshark. Surfshark is a super fast, easy to use VPN service that is jam packed full of features, easy to install, and it can run on unlimited devices, which I think is actually a really big deal.

Thanks to Surfshark for sponsoring this video. So it's time for brewing. We're there. Now, I have already ground in the pestle and mortar, two more doses of coffee for these next two tests. And I'll be honest, it has profoundly deepened my appreciation of coffee grinders that are built to do this thing because that was miserable and I had no fun. But it was quite silly. We're not gonna talk about infusion brewing today for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I should just acknowledge that yes, I could have just drunk the cupping bowl that I made of the pestle and mortared coffee and that would have been a reasonable cup of coffee, but that seems against the spirit of the video. And secondly, that would take us to talking probably about cowboy coffee. And there's no way that I'm talking about cowboy coffee until I'm in America on the back of a horse. So just so you know, we're talking about pour overs today. How do we make a pour over without a pour over? We've got two choices. I think we can make a paper filter pour over using our kitchen roll, or we can make a cloth filter pour over using a clean tea towel. That's what we're gonna do. So I'm gonna boil some water on this thing and then I'm gonna set up my kitchen roll pour over first. This is pretty cheap, not expensive kitchen roll, and I can't brew with kitchen roll without acknowledging the the innovation of Sang Ho Park, former colleague of mine who competed against me in the, I think 2010 UK Brewers Cup. And he competed using kitchen roll for his pour over, and he made it to the finals that year. And so, you know, shout out to Sang Ho, innovating back then. I'm gonna make just a very simple kind of Chemex style cone, and I'm gonna suspend it over this because I'm not gonna weigh anything. I want to, but I'm not going to, but this will tell me how much liquid has kind of passed through the coffee, which gives me an idea of roughly kind of where I am. Now, we're gonna secure this onto here. I'm gonna cheat a little bit and use something that I have lying around the studio, which is some clamps. You could use, I guess like paper clips in a push, like bulldog clips maybe. Your imagination has no limits. You go wild. There's the classiest coffee brew you're gonna see all day. So we just boiled our water. Now I'm gonna presume you have nothing but a pan. You could have maybe a jug handy. That would definitely help. Or you might have like a nice milk pan with a little spout. I have none of those things today, so we're just gonna see what happens. We're gonna go try a little bloom. Now we'll let that bloom for a little bit. This coffee is quite coarse, coarser than I would want for a pour over, So we're not gonna have like the best time. I'm probably gonna short pour it a little bit, which will mean it's technically under extracted, but at least like a decent strength. It's gonna need a stir too. Anything to up our extraction. I mean, that's definitely coffee. Whether it's good or not, we're about to find out. Cloth is rinsed, coffee is in. This is so absurd, Let's boil some water. On we brew. Two brews. So the final taste test of our MacGyvered coffee. I think I've learned some lessons about how I might do it again differently, but hang on. It doesn't taste of paper towel. Bright acidity. It's under extracted. It's a little sweetness there. It's not the worst cup of coffee I've ever had, it's just a bit weak. Let's have a go at you. Just a little laundry detergent in that one. Yeah, I thought I'd rinsed that enough. I hadn't really. That's not good. That's bad. It feels like I'm drinking clothes. So the winner, I think comfortably, is the kitchen towel, the paper towel. That works really well. There's no bad taste. I can't taste the paper towel. There's not much of it, it's pretty thin. I would definitely double fold it, but that's a good, clear cup, nicely filtered. Yes, you know, if you were to do this, I think the pestle and mortar is the best thing if you have one in your kitchen to replace a coffee grinder in an emergency. Don't hit it with a hammer. Odd that I have to say that. Don't chop it with a knife. Don't put it in a pepper mill. Those are bad things. When it comes to brewing, yeah, I'd probably do like a long infusion and then strain it through something like paper towel. That would be, I think the best of both worlds. Give you a decent extraction or a better extraction than a pour over, and you'd have a kind of nicer time overall, I think so. That's it. Paper towel is your friend, pestle and mortar is your friend if you are stuck and you need coffee and you have no coffee equipment.", "videoID": "JV1DsqwbmO0"}, {"title": "Review\uff1a The Aeropress Go", "text": "Today we're gonna review this, is this is the Aeropress Go, the brand new Aeropress, the first, I think new product they've made in quite some time. It's a new version of the Aeropress. And if I'm honest, I'm not sure I entirely understand it. Now in their own words, this is the better travel coffee press. And I think that's a really interesting decision. Because as far as I could tell, most people already really liked the Aeropress as a travel brewer, it was really easy to travel with. It was light, it was plastic, it was hard to break. You could get a grinder inside it if you use something like a Porlex or something like that. And people really liked traveling with it. I didn't feel like there was a problem traveling with it. So it's interesting to me that Aeropress chose for a new model, to pursue a better travel version. So let's see what's inside the box. So you get, so you get this, which is the whole thing. Right, like that's the idea, it's like an all in one travel solution. So here you've got red lid, that keeps everything together. You've got a little sort of papers holder that doesn't hold that many papers, but you can comfortably get maybe 15, 20 filters in this thing. Inside here, you've got then your Aeropress, which is a little bit smaller than a traditional Aeropress. You have your own important coffee scoop. And you've got your brand new stirrer, for stirring, I guess that way, that way for stirring, very important, gotta stir. And then you've got this, which is your travel cup. So the idea is that you'd be brewing on top of this, so it's kind of all in one. Now I'm still just a little bit confused, but before I explain that, I should just talk through how they may be changed this compared to the original, I should clear some space. So this is an original Aeropress and it's obviously a little bit taller. I'm surprised because I kind of feel one of the most common complaints about the Aeropress is that people wish it brewed more coffee, right, they wish it was bigger that they find the serving size a little bit small. So their decision to shrink it is an interesting one, right? Like a smaller Aeropress is, I feel like, something no one was really asking for. Aside from that they've changed the sort of the top of this to make this a little bit narrower. So it's still perfectly comfortable to plunge with the plunger dimensions are still exactly the same, which is good news, right? This is a good thing, it means that all of the fittings and fixtures of this thing all of the replaceable like the little rubber plunger, they, it's one part, right, like if you don't need to buy a different part. It's just one thing. And again, the filter holder, the paper holder at the bottom has changed very slightly. It's still the same size, it still takes the same papers. But the new one has, interestingly, a sort of blanked hole right in the middle, which I don't know, that doesn't seem necessary. Has it changed? I feel like, does this actually. Yeah, the original one fits completely fine. I don't, I don't actually know why they changed that it looks like there's actually less open surface area on the new one, right? So this actual piece will be providing a little bit more resistance. So that's an interesting choice to make, but it's the same size, right? It's the same papers, you don't have to buy different papers, there's none of that, by and large it's, there's no kind of cheeky trying to sell you new stuff here, right? They've just made a shorter Aeropress. They're sort of lopped, the top of, and the changed the sort of sort of shapes down here. Again, I think just to make it narrower, so that it all fits inside a cup. Now, I will, I promised you, I'll brew some coffee. And I promise you that at some point, I will, I promise, talk about how I brew coffee with an Aeropress. And maybe give some brewing technique kind of guidance there. This is not a video though. So I'm not gonna talk about how to brew with an Aeropress. I'm just gonna talk about this Aeropress, you are now free to go. I think about a travel brewer, and I think about the situations in which I might use a travel brewer. I might use one traveling though, to be honest, traveling usually means I'm in a hotel of some sort I'm making coffee there. Or to some people travel might be suitable for sort of the office, right? Like no one really likes nice coffee at work, but you do, so you take your own brewer and you do and stuff, but you do it at work. I guess there's camping, which is the thing that some people do some of the time. And then what's left? I mean people make Aeropresses on airplanes, which I find astonishing, fascinating, terrifying. In all of those situations, in very few cases am I missing a cup, right? Like that's, that's the kind of big change in the setup, which is you always have some sort of drinking vessel with you. But if I'm in a hotel, if I'm in an office, if I'm actually on an airplane, I probably can have access to a cup of some sort. That's not really the problem that I have. I'm intrigued that this was the solution that they went for, right, which required shrinking a device that people already thought was a little bit small, and they didn't really, in my opinion, sort of look at some of the other challenges people have. The biggest one for most people is that you need, if you care about coffee, you need to have a grinder, right? And the old Aeropress was great because it was just big and open and you could get a grinder inside it. And that was a nice way to sort of travel you could tuck some papers down the side of there too, get your little hand grinder in there. And then as a pretty all in one bundle. You just needed coffee beans, hot water, and a cup. I'm sort of surprised that Aeropress didn't go for a unit where they had sourced a nice little grinder to go inside this and that was part of the whole travel deal that, you know, they'd built something specifically to fit inside here I feel like that's the big wind. And right now I don't know of any grinder that will fit inside this, because when it's all put together, you can't have anything sticking out, right? Like it's got to fit exactly in this little space. And that's a little bit frustrating to me. Now I'm not picking on this brewer, I'm not being negative about it, it's still an Aeropress, it still brews very good coffee if you use it right. I'm just surprised that with a new product, they chased such a narrow use case of like, I have everything I need except a cup, right? That's the big innovation here, like I have everything I need except a cup and it's nice that the stirrer folds down now, that's kind of useful. And if I had both, I'd get rid of the original stirrer and just keep this around like that's better. This is a cute way to keep your papers 'cause it was always annoying when you were traveling and your papers got kind of crumbled up and damaged or often a little bit damp. That always drove me crazy. But the cup, I'm not sure I need a cup. I'm not sure I need a cup. But let's drink out of the cup. That's kind of what's missing here. I should make some coffee with this. Now, 'cause it's smaller, there are really two ways to brew the Aeropress, right? Like you can brew the traditional way we put coffee and hot water in. Or you can do what's called the inverted method, where you take the cap off, and you sort of standard up like that, and you brew in that way. And people do the inverted method because essentially, you have a much, a better infusion because no liquid can leak through the paper into the cup below. The downside of an inversion brew, is that you shrink the volume capacity of this Brewer. And because this is already smaller, I'm definitely not gonna do an immersion brew, so I'm definitely gonna brew the traditional way. So despite appearances to the contrary, I'm now organized I have rinsed my filter paper. This is ready to go on top of my cup. I have 15 grams of reasonably fine coffee I'm gonna add 200ml, 'cause this is an infusion brewer to me so 75 grams per liter makes sense. And away we go. So I'm gonna add my full water see how full 200 grams is in this thing? Ooh it's gonna be full, give this a little stir, I don't know where to put this, maybe that's what we sacrificed the lid for, and then lid on. And now we wait. Now I like to infuse for about a minute in these situations with this kind of grand setting. The Aeropress is really about marrying your grind size and your infusion time. I would recommend not too much agitation in terms of stirring, enough to make sure that all the coffee and all the water are in contact but not so much that you're doing a lot of work with that kind of extraction. I just don't really love the taste of it. Before we stir and plunge always take it off the scales 'cause you don't wanna be pressing on the scales. Its very bad, it can a break a scale. Give this warm little stir and then we're gonna gently from an awkward seated position, press. It's very exciting to watch me do this, isn't it? Turn it upside down. Leave it there for a minute, leave it there. Now, interesting to me to note that we weren't close to the capacity of that brewer. But we're about halfway up the cup. I mean, it's, this is kind of pointless. This is not a review of the brewer. We all know the Aeropress is a good Brewer. We know there's a competition devoted to it for good reason. It's a great play thing. But this is about the changes they've made, the cup that they've included, the decisions in some of that design, that I just don't necessarily get. Let's try and let's have little sip. It's not a, it's not a stunning drinking experience. It's not really particularly smooth edge on the cup. Its not actually beautifully finished in that regard. There's little, little bits on mine that I'm not stunned by. It's not a bad drinking experience, but it's not elevating it in that regard. Okay, its okay, I mean the coffee's good. That's a, of course a given. So let's answer the question. Should you get an Aeropress Go? And one, it's an Aeropress, if you like the way the Aeropress brews, it's an Aeropress still, it's just a little bit smaller. If your problem with the Aeropress has been that you lose papers, that you find it hard to keep it all together, that you are often struggling for something to drink your brew out of, yes, this is a good choice. This is a nice neat little setup. It's cute the way everything packs together. It looks good, I like the red cap. Yes, get it. If you wish the Aeropress was bigger, if you wish the Aeropress was more compatible with a grinder of some sort, it was easier to get a grinder inside or travel with, this is not for you. And I'm probably in the latter camp if I'm honest. You know, like I would probably, if I was traveling and I needed throw an Aeropress in my bag, I would throw an original Aeropress in my bag. I still really like the brewer, it's a good brewer, maybe it's just me, maybe I just don't get it. Maybe you're watching this and thinking I'm an idiot for not seeing the advantages here. Let me know. Let me know down in the comments below. Now this review is powered by Patreon. I bought this, they offered to send me one for free and I said no, I'd like to buy it and I did. And so this way I feel comfortable telling you how I feel about it. And this is gonna be given away to one of my Patreon backers.", "videoID": "U_hwYVboAVQ"}, {"title": "YouTube's Best Tiramisu (Ep #2)", "text": "Today we're gonna make and eat a lot of tiramisu. And I'll tell you why. We are looking for the best tiramisu on YouTube. And the reason for that is that actually I wanna get into doing some ingredient testing in my hunt for the ultimate tiramisu. But to test ingredients, you've gotta start with a recipe. And so what better place than YouTube? And today I'm gonna make five different recipes, taste them blind and we might learn a thing or two. As for our contenders today, we have, \"Binging With Babish\" Joshua Weissman, Claire Saffitz, Brian Lagerstrom and then as a benchmark, the original recipe from Le Beccherie, which is actually on YouTube, so we can use that too. So what you'll see next is me, tomorrow, having made them, I'll talk through the process of making them, the things I learned along the way and then we'll taste them blind and see which one is the best. It's the next day. And as you see before me, I have made a lot of tiramisu. And what we'll do is, I'm gonna slice into each one a little bit. We'll plate it up before the blind tasting but I just wanna talk about the experience of baking each of these, if baking is the right word, probably is. Creating, making, whatever you wanna say 'cause I have unsurprisingly strong opinions about each of the recipes here from a kind of user perspective. And we'll start with the, \"Basics With Babish\" recipe for tiramisu, which frankly was not basic. This was a recipe that did something quite unusual. Had you make, not lady fingers, had you make a kind of Pan di Spagna, like a a sponge cake, of a similar recipe to lady fingers. But obviously much, well we call it floppier, we call it the floppy cake recipe. And that was a kind of weird thing to do, quite a complex thing to do, that involved lots more work and lots more washing up. And for me, stopped it being a basic recipe. My complaints don't just end there. Secondly, I like when people show failure and I think we're gonna see some failure today. It's good to show failure. And the confusing thing is, in a how-to video, if you fail, you should be clear what the goal is and isn't. In this recipe, in the final stages where he is making the mascarpone cream, he says, \"Oh, I've overwhipped my egg whites, I'll fold them in, but they might collapse and so I'm gonna add some heavy cream to make sure it all sets up.\" A number of confusing things here. Firstly, what if I don't overwork my egg whites? Do I still put the heavy cream in or not? I presume I do, I presume I need to, but it's a weird thing. I don't know it, it just was a little bit chaotic for me and a bit strange and I'm curious to see whether I'll be able to tell that it was a softer sponge in there, that actually had to have quite a lot of coffee put into it 'cause it was using brewed coffee, not espresso. But I have comments on coffee to come. Next up here is the Joshua Weissman recipe. Again, this one was complex. There was a recipe where you were making your own lady fingers from scratch. What you ended up with and if you watch the video, I think you probably agree, is not really a traditional lady finger. It's a denser little cake, It's a little bit sort of wetter, less dry, than a proper lady finger. And if you look at the ingredients for lady fingers they have a lot more raising agents in them, I think to create a sort of bigger, fluffier, stiffer biscuit. These weren't as big, there weren't that many of them in the recipe and I'm kind of curious to see how that works from a texture perspective 'cause you're not gonna have that much lady finger per slice. Other than that, a little bit complex but not too difficult. But again, I'm not sure I'm sold on the idea of making my lady fingers from scratch or making a sponge of some sort from scratch. Next up, Claire Saffitz. The icebox cake, from a user perspective, it was a very easy, pleasant recipe to make. I liked the fact that it was built in the order where you didn't really need to wash things up as you go. In contrast, the Babish recipe would have you wash out your mixing bowl I think like five times, which is just a bit excessive for what is supposed to be a fun and simple delicious dessert to make at home. Unusual to have like a layer of whipped cream and not too much chocolate on the outside. Dunno how that's gonna go. It did obviously highlight my lack of decorating skills but I'm hoping what's inside is delicious. Next up is Brian's recipe. Now this is true of most of the recipes here, but I need to talk about it in particular here. Brian's recipe tells you to make 600 plus grams of espresso and that isn't excessive, but it was more than I needed. And if you're pulling shots with specialty coffee, coffee will be your most expensive ingredient and I just didn't wanna see any waste of it. And they were all guilty of it to some extent. You know, Babish talks about managing to get one cup of coffee into the mixture, into the cake itself and yet requests two cups of strong coffee or espresso at the start? And again, strong coffee and espresso are very different things. They're very different things. Last one was the traditional recipe from Le Beccherie. Mostly fine, didn't tell you how much coffee to make, just said to taste, which feels like cheating. The confusing bit was it said get a circular plate and lay 30 lady fingers in a row, right? Once they're soaked, 30. And then do another 30 on top. This, this is seven in a row. So 30 would be like out to here. That's, I don't know how big is your circular plate? I was just a bit confused by that one. So I improvised and made it like this which I think is acceptable, if it's not, I'm sure I'll hear about it in the comments below. Oh I should say at this point, if you're confused about what I mean by the original, we went to the city of Treviso in Italy in search of the original tiramisu, made a whole video about it the original recipe that you can find at a restaurant called Le Beccherie. If you haven't watched that video, it's up here, you can watch it now. It's time to get into the tasting, time to do the terrifying thing and cut a slice of each one, plate them up and we'll have a look at the insides. So I have my five slices of tiramisu, they're not the most beautiful slices. I did say there would be failure today and I think we can see there's a little bit of failure in my plating. Forgive me, I'm only human. This isn't what I do, I do the coffee bit. Anyway, I'm gonna put on this sleep mask, which is gonna act as a blindfold and look slightly creepy, I apologize for that. I'm gonna be handed spoonfuls of tiramisu at random and I will do my best to share my thoughts, as they're happening inside my mouth and brain. I'm ready. I'm ready, I think I'm ready. It's too much on the the spoon. I would say that there was kind of a nice coffee flavor throughout but that wasn't the kind of intensity of coffee around the lady finger, which makes me think I know which one that is. But, very enjoyable, but interesting in that kind of like broad coffee rather than intense moments of coffee. I'm ready for the next one. Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it. That's sweet. Very sweet. I like the texture actually really quite a lot. And the coffee flavor was nice and intense. This had a very classic vibe to it. But I feel like the sugar is the giveaway here. I enjoyed that, I think the texture of the mascarpone cream is excellent actually, I think that's a really nice texture. Coffee flavor is super good. I just think that's just very sugary. Ready for the next one. - One more, yep. - There? - Yeah. - Pretty sweet. Yeah, sweet. Not much going down in the coffee front actually. Really not much intensity of coffee flavor at all there. Texture of the cream, yeah okay, interesting I think. I want more coffee flavor. I don't know what, why I'm surprised that I would want more coffee flavor. Oh hello. Right, our fourth one of the day. Something's different about that one. Also quite strange. Not a lot of coffee flavor on that one either. Slightly weird texture to the cream. A little bit strange. I'm starting to worry that I've lost like a benchmark to taste these against. So I'm gonna taste these again afterwards with the blindfold off. But that was my initial reaction which was like quite spongy at this point. Weird cream texture. Again, lacking like a little bit of complexity as a dish. Thank you very much. It weighty, density in this one. Booze in that one, bit of bitterness to it, which feels like that's the one with the extra chocolate powder in there. A little chocolatey, good intensity of flavor but it didn't feel like explicit coffee flavor was the driver on this one. I'm gonna say all of this is delicious, right? We're in the the realm of tiramisu, which itself is delicious. I'm kind of curious what it is I've just tasted though. So you've had my initial responses. My guesses, I'm now gonna eat them, I have one more sort of comment on each, just in terms of how they are once you know what you're tasting and try to understand which one I got wrong and why and all that kind of stuff. But the game was not to guess which was which. The game was, just to give you my impressions of what it was I was tasting. Start with Babish. I was worried that this was gonna be a very wet cake tiramisu and I don't like wet cake tiramisu's, where the the sponge is is very soggy and wet. I was worried there wouldn't be enough coffee flavor with this one, when I was making it. And so I brewed the coffee stronger and I thought I put a decent amount in, but it just doesn't come through. And in addition, I feel like the taste of the mascarpone is a little less, a little softer. It's just a little, I don't know it's nice, but it lacks a bit of character and complexity I think for me still. Let's taste this one. That chocolate, the grated chocolate on top actually is quite an interesting hit of chocolateness. That's quite nice, I think I want more coffee still and I think part of that is down to the fact that this recipe has, even though you're making your own lady fingers, a kind of lower proportion of lady fingers to the whole dessert. It's more of a cream with some lady fingers as opposed to others which have a lot of lady fingers stacked in, sort of compressed in for maximum coffee cakeyness in the whole thing. That sort of instant coffee. I use high quality, specialty instant in the mascarpone cream, sort of feels a bit like cheating. It's very nice in that you get coffee in every bite and a nice distribution of coffee but you don't get that bite of coffee flavor, that intensity that I kind of wanted there. Very delicious though actually, balance of sweetness is great. The cream, the mascarpone cream is whole. Very good. I like this one a lot. I don't have much more to say about that. Brian, it's another one which ends up suddenly being chocolate dominant. There's chocolate in the coffee mixture and I think that's a little bit distracting. I don't actually taste the masala as I go back to it now, there's a little bit in this one. It just feels slightly sort of knocked out of balance by that additional chocolate that's in the biscuit mixture. Quick side note, Brian's recipe asks you to mix cocoa powder into the coffee mixture before dunking the biscuits in. We did that but our cocoa powder seemed to stop the biscuit properly absorbing the liquid. And you can see that in the cross section when we cut it. And in terms of taste, it's like the biscuit just didn't get as much coffee as it needed. I dunno why this happened and I wanted to highlight it here. You can't really taste the gelatin in in the cream and I'm not sure I'd bother putting gelatin in the cream. He does say it's optional, but I did want to try it to see what it would do. You do get nice slices as a result. It does cut well, but I don't think you, you know there's not a change in texture as you eat it that's particularly noticeable, which leaves us with the original. It's very traditional tasting but so, so sweet. This is a different recipe than the one that they served to us at Le Beccherie. This is much, much sweeter. So this is the one that's publicly available. This is the one that's sort of inducted into Italy's Culinary Hall of Fame. But it's not what they're serving at the restaurant. What they're serving is not nearly as sweet as this. This is distractingly sweet, overwhelmingly sweet I would say actually and if I was to make this again, barely half the sugar would go in for me, if I were making this one. An interesting selection of tiramisu's and as I said, I would be happily served any one of these, they're all a good time, 'cause that's kind of tiramisu's party trick. You've gotta do a pretty terrible job to make a bad tiramisu. To make an incredible tiramisu, that is difficult. Now I would say none of these really were coffee first. You can argue this one was, but it was instant coffee first. Good instant coffee, sure, but still not true coffee first. But I feel like actually the classic, if I sort of change the sugar amounts in here, it would be a good recipe to iterate on because it's it's clean and it's simple and it let's each ingredient speak quite nicely. I think there's a simplicity to it that's profoundly important and valuable in this recipe. And I think messing around with it and messing around with lady fingers and sponges and all that kind of stuff, I'm not sure it's taking you to greater heights in the recipe, if I'm totally honest.", "videoID": "9536y-4Nl7A"}, {"title": "Review\uff1a The Olympia Cremina", "text": "Today we're reviewing this. It's the Olympia Express Cremina. It's a small domestic lever espresso machine, and it has gathered over the years, something of a cult following. Why is that? Why is this machine so loved, so praised, so desired and yet so expensive? Let's dive in and find out. So a quick history of this machine and this company if you're not familiar with them, the company itself was founded in Switzerland in 1928, and for the first few decades, built exclusively commercial espresso machines. In 1961, they began to try and sell to the domestic espresso market with the first Cremina, but that was really just a re-badged La Pavoni lever machine. But in 1967, they bought that production in house and they began to build a brand new lever machine, very similar to the one that we see on the bench here. One of the first things that was interesting to me, was seeing just how many of those 1967 machines are still going today, are still in use, are still being bought and sold online. Now, how did this machine end up on this bench? Of all the machines, well, why this one? Well, it goes back to my review of this Smart Espresso Profiler here on top of the machine. And in choosing a machine, I spoke to the inventor, Gabor, and asked him what kind of machine he would recommend I test the profiler with. And he gave me a few options, but he did seem especially excited about the Cremina. And then I looked at the price, which is 3250 euros, and to be honest, I called and raised my eyebrows a little bit. But I trusted him, I trusted his enthusiasm and his knowledge of lever machines, and he connected me directly with Olympia, and they let me purchase directly from them. So here it is. And as I said, it has been modified to be able to use the Smart Espresso Profiler. Now, we should talk about how this thing works, so that we can get into pulling some shots with it, and talk about whether this thing deserves its reputation. The insides of this is actually deceptively simple. You have a large steam boiler in there, you fill it just by opening this tap at the top, you can only do that when the machine is cold and there's no pressure inside it. You put a funnel in, you pour your cold, delicious filtered water in, seal it up, turn it on, and you're nearly there, that boiler is sealed, the water boils, build steam pressure, that's useful for a couple things. And then you've got a reservoir of boiling water in there as well. Now, the way lever machines work is that the force of brewing the espresso is generated by you pulling down on this lever. But, we are gonna use the pressure inside the steam boiler as a part of this brewing process. You see when you lift this lever, water is able to flow from the boiler, through the group heading out. And it's driven out by that steam pressure. Later on when we're pre-infusing, that pre-infusion pressure is entirely tied to the pressure inside the boiler. One of the things that people particularly like about the Cremina, is the way that the group head works. Now, the water when it leaves the boiler is 115 degrees Celsius. It's way too hot for brewing coffee, you needed to lose some temperature along the way, otherwise, you're gonna extract some very harsh, very unpleasant flavors from your coffee. That's where the group head comes in. The group head on this acts as a little heat sink. As the water passes through that group head it radiates the heat to the metal, and the metal wall attached to the boiler is much cooler than the boiler. So, with a little bit of management, you can get very accurate, very repeatable temperatures with this thing, by using that group head as a heat sink. Now, one of the things that Gabor sent me was a little strip to show me how hot the group head is. This I think is actually really useful for someone like me who's a little bit of an obsessive. So knowing that my group head is about 80 to 85 Celsius is very helpful in knowing roughly what kind of brew temperature I'm gonna get when I pull a shot. Obviously it has a steam valve and you've got a good pressure of steam there, you can steam very good milk with this very easily. It's comparable to steaming on a commercial espresso machine. I might complain that the steam one doesn't move, it's on a bowl like many other commercial ones, but it's not really a big issue for me, I think it's a very nice, simple mechanism, it works very well. But really, that's it. That's the machine. It's a big tank, it's a lever, it's steam valve, that's it. And yet it's over 3000 euros in price. Well, why? And I think a big part of the why, is just how well this thing is built. The fit, the finish, every detail on this thing is stunning. If you're a pure utilitarian, if you just want the function, if you want to be able to press hot water through coffee, you can do that much cheaper. And so now maybe you're thinking, \"Okay, so maybe this makes especially good espresso, maybe this makes better espresso than another espresso machine.\" And I would say this makes incredible espresso if you use it right, and it makes terrible espresso if you use it badly, like most espresso machines. At some point, you cross a line where in the machine is capable, or it's not. This is extremely capable, but it's not really about that. What I'm gonna do now is I'll fire up the Smart Espresso Profiler, I'll pull a shot, and I'll walk you just quickly through the process, so you understand how it works. Now the portafilter on this is a little bit smaller, and so your doses are gonna be typically a little bit smaller too, a little bit more traditional in the Italian sense. I've been dosing between 14 and 15 grams, typically. On here, put about 14.6 grams, and we'll set that into the Profiler. On the side of my group head, I have my temperature strip, so I can see how hot the grip head is, that will give me some idea of the brew temperature that I'll get. What I might wanna do is increase that temperature just to touch. And I can do that with a quick flush, by just lifting the valve a little bit. So the first thing, lift up the lever all the way, fill that chamber above the coffee and begin your pre-infusion. Generally it takes about 10 seconds or so to fully pre-infuse the cake for me. Once that's happened, we can begin to push. Here I'm going for a reasonably high start and a declining profile. I'm gonna aim for about two to one. How does it taste? Thick, anxious, rich, well extracted. That is very sweet. It's a really lovely espresso, that two to one ratio, you often can have a lot of under extraction, I don't have a lot of that here. It's a very balanced shot. Very enjoyable, very nice finish. Excuse me. But it isn't just that, it's not just the espresso that it makes, that will make me sad when I see this machine go. And go at will to one of my Patreon supporters. I will miss this because I will miss the process of making espresso with it. When you look at an espresso machine on paper, you see a boiler size, you see ratings, you see pressures, you see that kind of a thing, what you don't see, what you can't understand is, how pleasurable is this to use. I tell a lot of people not to buy espresso machines, because they don't want a hobby, they want a cup of coffee, they don't wanna spend half an hour playing with espresso in their kitchen. But, some of us do wanna spend half an hour playing with espresso. Now when I think about this machine, I think of it in a way as being on the same spectrum as something like the Decent, but at totally other end of that spectrum. Both are incredibly capable of making delicious coffee, but go about it in entirely different ways. And in truth, with both of those machines, I couldn't just walk up to them, and first time, pull a great shot. With most commercial machines, the way that they work is pretty simple, they're reliable, they're a known quantity, using them is actually very, very, very easy. With this, no, it's not easy. I didn't pull good shots with this straightaway, it took me a while. And I'm pulling better shots every time I use it, as I understand it a little bit more. There is the understanding of the technology of the things, understanding brew temperatures, there's getting to understand brew pressures. But then there's the actual process of using your hands to create espresso, that is incredibly satisfying. It's a machine that encourages hospitality, you wanna make way more espresso than you want to drink. And underneath the hood, it's beautifully built, the components are great. And you can tell it's beautifully built, because there are people pulling shots on machines that are 50 years old. And those people talk about the positive improvement in construction in newer machines. This has gotten better with time. It is simple, but it is incredibly robust. It's compact, it's beautiful, I really enjoy using this thing. It is an incredible pleasure to do so. And I would understand that it's part of a journey for a lot of people. In some ways, it would be a terrible shame to start here in your espresso journey. If this was your very first machine, you probably wouldn't know how good you've got it. You wouldn't know quite how much fun you're having, unless you'd had something else beforehand. It's a machine that I think will take you years to really, really feel like you're getting the best out of. And it won't be that your coffee won't taste good for years and years and years, you'll make great coffee pretty quickly. But it will get better over time. It's something that rewards your attention and your understanding. So this is the Olympia Cremina. On paper, not so much technology. Nothing actually particularly new about it in nearly 50 years. It's got a big boiler, that's nice. It has a small footprint, that's nice. But what you can't see on paper is the pleasure. What you can't see, is that as part of a journey in espresso, this would be something to strive for, something to achieve something to own, something to enjoy, something to pass on to future generations, if you look after it right. I think this is a beautiful machine, I think it's really interesting.", "videoID": "Vyhn49uXyHk"}, {"title": "Better than cold brew\uff1a How to make iced filter coffee", "text": "It's summer, it's hot, it means you probably wanna drink a delicious cold cup of coffee. And this is my favorite way to do that. It's often called iced filter coffee, or Japanese-style iced coffee. What we're gonna do here is just cut to the chase. I'm gonna give you the recipe and then afterwards, I'm gonna explain why I'm doing what I'm doing. To start with, you're gonna brew with 65 grams of coffee, per liter of water, or five grams more than you would usually use. You're gonna grind a little bit finer than you usually would. You're gonna brew with 40% of the weight of the brew as ice and 60% as hot water. So in a 500 mil brew, that's 200 grams of ice, 300 mils of hot water. You're gonna bloom with two to three times the weight of coffee as water, and you're gonna let it bloom for at least 45 seconds. Try and stretch the brew between two and a half to three minutes if you can. If you don't have a pouring kettle, that doesn't really matter. At the end of the brew you're gonna stir once in a circular motion, and then once in the opposite direction, and let it draw down. After you brew, swirl the decanter as thoroughly as you can to get rid of any remaining pieces of ice, and then pour onto fresh ice cubes in a glass. Let me explain why I'm doing what I'm doing. First things first, how much coffee to water? I use five grams more per liter than usual for two reasons. Firstly, when coffee gets cold, it loses some of its aromatic intensity. It just tastes less intense. That's true of any cold beverage. Secondly, even though you gonna chill it down pretty cold, it's still gonna dilute a little bit when you serve it over ice and you take your time drinking that out and about in the beautiful weather. Now, we could obviously dose higher than that but then we start to run into some problems. The more coffee we have, the harder it's gonna be to do a proper extraction of that coffee because we've got a lot less brew water than usual. Which brings me on to the ratio of ice to hot water. Now, what I did here was a bunch of different experiments. If I had 400 grams of ice 100 grams of hot water, my beverage would be very cold but the extraction wouldn't be good. So I made a whole bunch of different brews, with varying amounts of ice, to find out what the ending temperature was gonna be, and to find out the point of diminishing returns, where adding more ice doesn't get any colder. In this case, I was using ice that was between minus 18 and minus 20 degrees Celsius. If you have a domestic freezer that goes colder than that, you could use less ice. Again, if you're using an ice machine, the ice may not be that cold, and you may end up needing a little bit more. All ice is not created equal. Now that increased bloom time is there to help us get some more extraction out of it. Having a longer bloom increases our contact time and increases our extraction. The reason I like this way of brewing so much, is that you really get to taste, the qualities of the coffee that you're brewing with. Brewing with cold water, cold brew, often removes a lot of origin characteristics, and kind of makes the coffee taste pretty chocolaty, very pleasant, pretty low acidity, but not really the coffee that you paid for, not the coffee that roasters have worked so hard to source, and roast and preserve and sell. Brewing hot lets you extract all of that good stuff, even if it is difficult to do with a lot less brew water. If you still have pieces of ice left over in the brew, you've used too much ice, you could use a little bit less, and more brew water, and more brew water is always good. It lets you do a better quality extraction, lets you get more out of that coffee. So you wanna use as much brew water as is possible. And at the end, you should have something delicious, and cold, and complex, and incredibly enjoyable. And something you should go and make yourself, and all your friends and family, right now. There is coming soon a full pour over how to video, covering lots of different methods, lots of different techniques, what I would recommend, and ways that you can play with your coffee brewing to get the most out of it.", "videoID": "PApBycDrPo0"}, {"title": "The Magic of Salt in Coffee", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about a topic a lot of you have requested, which is should I be putting salt in my coffee? And the answer is hopefully not, but maybe. To explain all this properly, we're gonna have to dive a little bit, just a little bit into some taste science to start off with and I'll also say that for the most part we are gonna talk about sodium chloride as salt. Salt is considered one of the five basic tastes, that are sort of alive, but aren't, so you've got salt, sour, sweet, bitter and umami. There are other tastes that take place in the mouth, I would argue that piquancy like heat is one of them, astringency is another, it's a contentious topic, I don't wanna get into it too far, but salt is one of those things and it's a very simple interaction, your tongue has a bunch of taste receptors, taste buds on it and what it's generally doing is detecting sodium ions crossing a membrane and you experience saltiness and with it though, you also experience some synergistic effects, generally saltiness can amplify sweetness, for example and it can also mitigate or reduce bitterness. Now I learned a lot of this from a book called \"Tasting and Smelling\" by Gary Beauchamp and Linda Bartoshuk, it's still available, but it is ridiculously expensive now, I did not pay that much money, but I'll put a link to it in the description, if you find a second-hand copy cheap, I would recommend it very highly. Now when it comes to researching salt and bitterness, one of the compounds that they often test is caffeine. Now caffeine is quite a bitter substance, it's rare that you taste it on its own, but it does contribute to coffee's overall bitterness, but if you drunk decaf coffee, you know that even without caffeine, coffee is still bitter. Now thankfully it seems that salt does impact lots of different kinds of bitterness, so salt is basically our friend, we should be putting salt on our coffee all the time then, right? Firstly one of the pleasures of coffee is when it's good, it has the right kind of bitterness much like beer or chocolate, some bitterness is very pleasant, when it's balanced out properly by sweetness and some acidity and overall it's a complex and enjoyable thing. I don't wanna get rid of it anymore than I wanna get rid of the acidity of coffee, I want it to taste good and we should also consider salt to be an addition like milk or cream or sugar, it might make the drink more palatable, but it will change it, it will obscure the truth of it in a way without sounding overly philosophical, it'll be harder to taste where that coffee is from and the journey that it's taken from seed to cup. Secondly and this is very important, salt perception is not universal, what is my threshold of detection, my threshold of recognition might be different to yours. Let's talk about actually putting some salt into coffee. Now to start with, I have a simple example, I have a V60 that I brewed, that was way too fine, it's over extracted, I brewed it quite slowly at too fine of a grind, it would be harsh and a little bit bitter. There will be some tastes that are unpleasant in it, that are not bitter tastes, things like astringency, salt will do nothing for those. Often you'll see a recommendation that you put the salt in with the ground coffee and that tastes better than putting it straight into the cup of coffee, now that didn't make much sense to me, except that if you're working at pretty low concentrations, it's probably easier to be accurate when you're scaling up. If you overdose or under-dose the amount in the actual cup, that'll be a much more noticeable fluctuation, than doing it across an entire liter, liter and a half of coffee, however in this situation I'm gonna be dosing the cups and to do so I have my good friend, some saline solution, this is just 20% salt, 80% water, so that I know in a gram of this, there's .2 grams of salt. So here's the test, I'm gonna take this particular cup, I'm gonna put in to start with half a gram of saline, I'm adding .1 of a gram total salt into about 200 mils of liquid. Give you a little stir. Now this isn't a blind test as you can tell, 'cause I can see the coffee. Let's start with our un-dosed section. Not great, a little harsh. That is better, but it's actually noticeable salty to me, that's .1 grams of salt in 200 mils, that's really interesting, it's quite noticeable and it is better. I think it's a little bit tastier, it's a little bit softer, it does have a touch of that saltwater mouth feel, but thinking about this, how do you accurately dose with a teaspoon .1 gram of salt? You can't, it's not really doable. Now if I was trying to dose this into the basket, I would have to presume that everything got dissolved, but I wouldn't know for sure and at that point I might be dosing, you know, less than half a gram of salt into a half liter of V60. So for me, this is one where you need a delicate hand, I absolutely wouldn't recommend just getting a pinch of salt and putting it in your coffee, because you could very easily end up with something too salty. To be honest, I would say an over-extracted V60 coffee is not really an adequate endgame boss for salt to face on this one, I think we need a bigger challenge for it to overcome to really endorse it as a good idea, as a useful thing to have around. There's only one option for that, Nescafe Original, not even Gold Blend, we're going for the basics, the basic, basic, basic, this would be quite a bitter product. I'm gonna get a couple of mugs of this brewed and then we'll dose it with salt and see how much it takes for it to be good and does it get to good before we get too salty? Let's find out. These smell really bad, really bad. Let's make them better, they're made to spec, you get a spec, 1.8 grams of coffee to 200 mils of water, these are exactly that each. Let's start gentle, .3 grams I think is probably about right. Now the idea of adding salt to coffee is not new, it's common in lots of cultures, you see it often in particular in Scandinavian countries, they have a big history of that. You might think that's weird, the Scandinavians do the light roast thing, but that's a new thing, historically dark roasted coffee was everywhere. So let's get our sort of pain threshold set with a benchmark of just plain Nescafe. It's not for me, it's not for me. Oh, then it's better, even at .3 of a gram, that's better, I'm gonna dose it up a little bit more though, I'm gonna take it up to .6. Wow, that is, it's pretty magical actually, that's pretty magical. I'm gonna take it up a little bit more. Let's be clear about what this is not doing, this is mitigating bitterness, this is reducing my perception of bitterness, slightly improving the texture of mouth full of coffee, the flavor is the same, it's absolutely the same, it just doesn't hurt quite as much to drink. But that is really surprising and it's interesting. So bear in mind in this 200 gram cup, at most I had .2 grams of salt in it, that's very little salt, that is a pinch and I hate things like a pinch, I hate any volumetric measurements of anything, 'cause they're very confusing and how much even is a pinch? 'Cause it's gonna be different if I'm using table salt to using say kosher salt or even Maldon big, flaky sea salt, but a mass of salt is a mass of salt, it is consistent and glorious and highly recommended. Speaking of which, I would recommend making a salt solution like this with table salt, with cheap, cheap, cheap salt. It's okay if it's got a little bit of anti-caking agent in it, but you don't want any other extras in there, you don't need raw salt, unrefined salt, you just need sodium chloride as cheaply as you can get it. So don't bother with kosher salt, don't bother with expensive, fancy salts, they don't have anything extra, that's gonna do a better job here, you just want cheap table salt. A final word of warning, this doesn't work for everybody, for some people their suppression of bitterness from salt doesn't particularly happen, you'll get a little effect, but not as strong as other people, so if that's you, I'm sorry, but don't be weirded out, if it doesn't seem to work too much. For most people though, it's a surprising and interesting little change. Now I've seen people like Scott Ray are recommending this on Instagram, on his kind of tip of the day, other places, it's a very old idea in lots of different countries, so why not learn about how you taste a little bit more, learn a bit more about what you like and how your sense of taste works.", "videoID": "9PUWQQ-joKE"}, {"title": "XeoLeo Vs Fellow Ode Vs Wilfa Uniform\uff1a A Grinder Comparison", "text": "Today, we're gonna be doing a grinder comparison. As a comparison, it's a grouping, it's kind of weird, but I promise you, there's method to my madness. Now, two of these grinders we have seen before. The Wilfa Uniform's appeared in a couple of videos already. This is the grinder that I have at home. If you haven't seen anything about it, click up here or down in the description below. And then we have the Fellow Ode that was in a video recently. If you wanna have a little look at that, that's up here or down the description. And then there's this thing. This is the Xeoleo, I'm not sure of the pronunciation. It's a grinder I bought on AliExpress for about $160. And it's a fun little grinder that sort of, sort of makes sense in this comparison because the Wilfa, this one is about 325 pounds or 275 without the scale in the top. The Ode seems to be around 295 pounds. So this is half the price of the other two. Why is it here? Well, it's here because of its burr set. This has a standard flat burr set. This one has a kind of hybrid interlocking burr set. And the most extreme version of that is actually inside this, which is called ghost teeth burrs, or interlocking burrs, and they look like nothing else, really. They're a really unique design that you really don't see very much. But I wanted to pick up a grinder like this that had them and see how it fared. Here's how the testing is gonna run. I'll just quickly show you a few little things about this Xeoleo, just so you're kind of up to speed with it, if you're familiar with these other two grinders. And then we're gonna run a few simple tests. We're ultimately gonna brew three V60s side-by-side that we'll taste, but before that, we'll start with a pretty simple speed test. We'll grind 30 grams of coffee in each one of these grinders and see how long it takes. Then we'll have a little look at the grinds distribution, nothing too complicated, but I hope interesting nonetheless. And then, ultimately, we will brew those three, and taste them side-by-side. Now, when it comes to setting the grind for the V60, this was an interesting challenge. Both of the two grinders that have interlocking burrs have limits on how fine they can go before the burrs touch. And that limit is much coarser than a standard flat burr grinder. So this grinder can go all the way down past espresso fine into kind of Turkish coffee fine, almost like a flour. These two both have a very similar limit that's just about fine enough for me to brew a V60 with. Without that limit, we could have brewed a different brew method or a different amount of coffee, but this seems the fairest way. I was able to dial them all in to a very similar extraction level which should make, I hope, for an interesting tasting. This won't be, however, an exhaustive tasting because there's only so much coffee tasting that can be done, but it should be interesting nonetheless. The one other thing to note is that this grinder has been in use for a couple of years now. It grinds 30 to 60 grams of coffee most days for the last two years. These have all had a good amount of coffee put through them. They've also both been recalibrated to be able to go as fine as is possible without the burrs touching, but this is just a much more seasoned and used grinder. Let's start, though, with a quick overview of this little grinder. For $160, it's kind of fun. Its burr set is here at the front and it is vertically mounted, which I think is generally a good thing with the motor sitting behind it. Your hopper on top feels pretty plastic. Doesn't feel very expensive or particularly lovely, but it's $160, but it does sit on top of a little gate. This would allow you to turn on your motor without coffee falling into the burrs, but having loaded your beans into the hopper, once your motors up and running, you can just open the little gate and your beans will drop into a running motor, which is generally considered better for the grinder. So that's a nice little touch. On the back of the grinder, the power switch has two power settings. It has a continuous mode. And it has a push-to-go mode, because on the front here, there's a little button, and as you push it in, the grinder runs. Now, it comes with this dosing cup that seems a little bit odd at first glance because it's got three pieces. Piece number one is your grinds catch bin, pretty standard, nice enough. There's a little insert for it though, which looks like a tea strainer, but instead, has a bunch of holes in it for potentially sieving out the fines, which is an unusual addition to a grinder, I will add. The holes appear to be about 500 microns in size, which is quite large, but probably pretty effective at getting anything remotely fine out of there. And then if you are shaking, there is a little lid. So you can grind in, put the lid on top, and shake the life out of it to get rid of any fines that you potentially don't want in your grind distribution. I will just say now, having criticized certainly the Ode for this, and a little bit, the Wilfa, this is a messy grinder. Coffee goes everywhere. Whether you do a little spritzing first, a little droplet of water in the beans or not, it makes a terrible mess. And it does annoy me quite a bit, but for $160, can it grind coffee in an interesting and delicious way? That's really the question. And to talk about those burr sets, I suppose we should open it up. To open it up is actually pretty easy. There's two screws on the front here and we'll take 'em off kind of the same time. Now, the teeth on this are really unlike anything I really ever see in any other coffee grinder. I've never seen burrs like this in a commercial grinder that I've used. I'm not saying they don't exist, just that I'm unfamiliar with them. But you've got these two sets of teeth that interlock with each other that are gonna cut the coffee in a totally different way. That's really interesting. That was my motivation, actually, to buy this grinder, it wasn't the price. I just wanted a ghost teeth burr grinder to check out, to see what I thought of it. Does it reduce fines? Does it grind more uniformly? Does coffee taste better? These are the questions we wanna answer. So I'll put it back together, weigh out some coffee, and we'll run our first test, which is grind speed. Ready, steady, go. Pretty quick, let's try the Ode. Very quick. And now let's try the Wilfa. A bit slower, a lot slower. Now, for some people, this is an absolute deal breaker. They can't stand how slow this is. I've talked about in the past that it doesn't bother me that much because I'm usually doing other things while coffee is grinding. I can be sorting out water, rinsing papers on a brewer. There's other stuff to be doing. But in comparison to these two, it is so, so slow. So for today's video, I'm gonna be using a couple of tools from Kruve. This is the sifter that you've seen before. I'm gonna be sifting this with two screens inside it. This will allow me to separate the coffee pieces by size. The first piece is 1,000 microns, a millimeter in size. Anything bigger than this for me is a little bit bigger than I might want. It's heading towards being a bit bolder-y. Then you've got a screen at 400 microns. Anything below this will be a fine-ish piece of coffee, not necessarily a quote/unquote, \"fine,\" but certainly a finer piece. These are very broad, broad, sort of cross-sections of coffee distribution. But I'm actually less worried these days about fines, and I'm much more worried about larger pieces in my coffee. It's a big chunk of coffee that I just won't get anything out of. It's inevitably going to under-extract in comparison to the rest of the coffee there. So bigger pieces are, for me, as big a concern as very fine pieces. And, you know, while there are things out there to sieve out fine pieces, rarely do people sieve out large pieces or worry about them very much, which I think is perhaps a mistake. Now, I also recently bought this. This is the Brewler from Kruve, which I think is a reasonably hilarious pun. It's kind of useful in today's video. One, I told you that the size of the holes in that sieving piece for the Xeoleo were 500 microns. This just let me check that. So you've got holes of each micron size along here. Now, this is intended, I think, to be put next to coffee to give you an idea of how large your pieces of coffee are. They also give you a little grind distribution chart to show you roughly where each brew method kind of lies. Let's start sifting. I'll give each grinder a couple of minutes of shaking, and then, we'll have a look at how those 30 grams of coffee have separated out. So far, so interesting. And I'll throw that data up now as a percentage of the total grounds, that way it's kind of normalized for any retention stuck in the grinder. And you can have a look at that chart. Now, this is really important. Before you make any real meaningful decisions or inferences from this data, know that it's mostly worthless. This is not a full grind distribution. This just gives you a rough idea of how many pieces are above a certain size, how many pieces are below a certain size, that's it. There's no more granular information about the distribution. What's notable to me is that these are all grinders achieving a similar level of extraction for a similar brew method with quite different grind distributions. When you brew coffee, it's really only the surface of the grounds that can be extracted. In a large piece of coffee, water won't really meaningfully penetrate inside it to get the good stuff out. It'll really be what's on the surface. What you can't tell, even from a ground distribution chart, is total surface area because it's kind of a 2D snapshot of a 3D thing. Looking at this, I don't know how they're gonna achieve a similar level of surface area, and I don't know how that's going to taste yet. That's what we're gonna find out. But what we can say is that Uniform is better from that testing, even though it may have less larger pieces, comparatively few very fine pieces, we don't know whether the stuff between 400 and 1,000 is a wide spread or unimodal. We just don't know that stuff. But when we taste, that's the important thing, and we should probably taste. But before we do that, I should note that there is one grinder probably missing from this range. And that's one from Baratza, something like the Sette. I'm not including Baratza in testing at the moment because I'm doing a coffee giveaway with any sponsored video. I'm giving away five Baratza Encores to anyone who really needs them, anywhere in the 39 countries that we can ship to and warranty to. If you can afford a grinder, please don't enter and buy one from a local business. But if life is tough right now, and you could really do with a grinder, click down below, it's free to enter. From my point of view, it just felt a little bit wrong to be working with one company while comparing it to another. Even though I'm paying for these grinders, I don't want the perception of bias in these kind of reviews. And this is all possible, these giveaways, thanks to this video sponsor, which is Squarespace.

What I'm gonna do is pour a good size sample of each brew into a cupping bowl. It'll be marked on the bottom for which grinder it came from. Once they're all brewed, then I will leave, someone else will switch them around so I don't know what I'm tasting. I'll let them all settle to kind of room temperature when they'll be very easy to taste the differences. And I come back and taste them and talk about them. And then at the end of that, I'll find out which is which, let's brew. So the brew's been brewed. I'm gonna leave the room. These are gonna get switched around, and I'll come back when they're cool enough that they're all pretty similar temperatures, and I'll start tasting them. Now, as we get into the tasting, this is a really important thing to think about first. This is why people get kind of mad about refractometers because if you measure the refractive index, if you measure the strength of these three brews, they're all pretty much the same, but they're gonna taste different. Which means that just hitting the right numbers doesn't guarantee you a good brew. It's how you get there, that's kind of everything. Secondly, I am familiar with these grinders. This isn't the first time I brewed with them. I've brewed with the Xeoleo a little bit, I've had it a few months now. Obviously, I've brewed with the Wilfa for a couple of years at least. The Ode, only maybe a month or so. But it's not my first time brewing these. So I do have some expectations around how coffee has tasted from these that might be reflected in this blind tasting. We'll find out. This brew is okay, but it just has this present kind of bitterness coming in at the back of it. Like, it's a little hollow, but also a little bitter. This particular kind of bitterness, I'm gonna take a guess, reminds me of the bitterness I often get from the Xeoleo grinder. There's often something about it that just feels a little bit harsh and almost burnt in the coffee. And I don't really understand why it tastes like that, but it often does to me. Certainly with lighter roasts, it can shift that way. I haven't brewed a lot of darker roasts with this, which may be where it shines. Anyway, moving on. That brew is very clean. It's very sweet. It's very pleasant. At this point, I don't know which grinder it is. It's just a, it's just a really nice, sweet brew of coffee. And honestly, so is this one. These are both very nice. What I would say with both of them, if I didn't know the grinder, I would wanna go just a fraction finer. Which means if one of these is the Ode, and I think one of them is the Ode, it's frustrating to me that I can't go that little bit finer still. That is for me, with light to medium filter style roasts, a little bit of a headache. If I had to pick, maybe this one is just a fractionally more complex brew? This is also very nice too. Like, these are both very tasty brews. This one is a tier below in terms of flavor even though it's of a very similar extraction. It just doesn't feel as kind of coherent, for want of a less pretentious term. But it just doesn't feel as together. It just feels a bit disjointed. There's some astringency here. There's some bitterness here. I just don't like it as much. This, in this particular one-off experiment, I like the most, but this is also a very tasty brew too. I would struggle potentially in a triangle test to pick them apart. Let's find out what's what. This has an X at the bottom, which means it is indeed the Xeoleo. This has a little U at the bottom for Uniform. And this one, therefore, is of course, I don't know why I'm looking, it's obviously the Ode. Let's wrap this all up with a little summary. Let's start with the Xeoleo. This is cheap and it's surprisingly full-featured for its cheapness. It's easy to access the burrs. It's east to take it apart. There's a few little details that are kind of nice. It's messy, it's really messy. And honestly, I don't love the coffee that it produces. It's up against grinders twice its price. So it would be kind of shocking if it made coffee as good as those grinders, and it doesn't make coffee as good. If I was drinking darker roasts, I wonder if the burrs inside this are better suited to those kinds of roasts, or you know, that in combination with the sifting option that it has built into it, which I'm generally against, because it's pretty wasteful. So it's kind of fun. It doesn't feel too cheap. It doesn't feel super well-made either. It's kind of worth the money? I'm not sure I'd recommend though, importing them if you have no support. If it breaks, all that kind of stuff, you're kind of on your own. So buying stuff like this is very much at your own risk. The Ode is a great little grinder that has a couple of frustrations for me. I wish it could go finer. And if I had an Ode, I wouldn't be selling it right now, I wouldn't be upgrading it to a Uniform, necessarily, because I'd be waiting for them to produce some other burr options. There's both the SSP burrs that I'll test in the future alongside the promised new burrs from Fellow themselves, that are able to go that a little bit finer. This makes it a kind of interesting platform for different burrs in the future. And for that, it is interesting. Overall, it's a capable grinder. It's a good-looking grinder. And I think it has an exciting future. Right now, though, if I was shopping, I would just be thinking about, is it worth paying the extra for the new burrs or would I just wait until they offer new burrs at the same price as this right now? And that leaves the Uniform, which does a good job. It makes nice coffee. And it has a very wide range of grind sizes. It's incredibly slow. It comes with a scale if you want it to, that's really not worth the money, but the cheaper one, I think, is worth the money at 275 pounds. It's not perfect, I've talked about that in the reviews. It has its limitations, but in this particular situation, I think it did very well. If you started from scratch and you don't own a grinder or you're looking to upgrade to this level, it should be a contender and is worth thinking about, but I would be holding off to see how the new burrs perform with this thing. And that's definitely something I will look at in the future. This particular one is going to a Patreon backer that's been picked already and is heading out as soon as we finish this review. I'll buy another unit in the future to put different burr sets in that, to give it a full test. But let me know down in the comments below, what did I miss today? What did you want me to explore about these grinders and tell you a little bit more about? All of them, it's very easy to access the burrs on them.", "videoID": "bVqGgvMnp4M"}, {"title": "A Beginner's Guide To Buying Great Coffee", "text": "Welcome to today's video and the beginning of a series of sorts, \"A Beginner's Guide to Coffee.\" And this video is the beginner's guide to coffee buying. Now I know you know how to buy coffee but what today's video is all about is helping you explore the world of coffee more easily, more enjoyably, with less mistakes. Here's the thing. If you have found a coffee that you love be it a coffee roaster or a coffee brand, that's great. I don't want you to stop drinking that thing. I'm not going to tell you what to drink today. But part of the joy of coffee is the diversity of flavor and whatever you're enjoying now, there's something, something out there that I think you could enjoy even more. But what I don't need to do is experiment, gamble, buy something that kind of looks good and then hate it. That's the goal today, help you buy stuff that you're likely to really enjoy and avoid stuff that you're likely to really dislike. We're gonna break this down into three sections. Part one is going to be the golden rules of buying coffee. Part two will be where to buy coffee, and the pros and cons of each. And then part three will be about kind of decoding a bag of coffee, decoding the label on a bag of coffee. What are they trying to tell you? And how do you match that and marry that up to what you want? Before we begin, I should disclose a couple of very important ways in which I am biased. Firstly, I have a strong preference and I'm a big advocate for specialty coffee. If you're watching this and you don't like specialty coffee, that's okay, this is still a useful video for you, but just know that I have a very strong preference towards it. Secondly, I also co-own a coffee company. Now none of our products are in the video today, there are no links to our products in the description down below, but you should know and I should disclose this right at the start. So let's begin. The golden rules for buying coffee. And the first one you probably know, buy fresh. But what does fresh mean? Now coffee, after roasting declines in a pretty steady way over time, it loses its aromatics, they kind of float off into the atmosphere and escape and you also develop some unpleasant flavors things go stale and they begin to oxidize. And so a combination of those things is what happens when coffee stales and goes off. It's food safe for a really, really long time. Some of you might have seen I've drunk coffee from the 1950s and while I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, yeah, coffee lasts a really, really long time but it's not at its best. Now typically coffee will be dated in one of two different ways. Specialty coffee typically will offer you a roast date, the date on which it was roasted. And that's pretty useful. You know how old the coffee is, exactly. However, if you're selling a product through a supermarket, supermarkets don't want you to put a roast date on there. They hate roast dates. They want a best before date. This is often 12, even 18 sometimes 24 months after the roasting date. So you don't really know when the coffee was roasted. This is not a choice that the roasters get to make, really, this is a choice from supermarkets. In fact, here on the table I've got the same coffee, one from a supermarket and this has a best before date and the same roaster, same coffee bought directly from them has a roasted on date. So understand this is a little bit confusing, where you buy it will impact the information that you have. More on that a little bit later on. Today we're gonna cover coffees for both filter coffee drinking and for espresso. And what gets confusing about the messaging of fresh, is that fresh isn't always the best. Now when you roast coffee, a lot of CO2 comes out. That's why any bag of coffee will have a little valve on it that you can squeeze the gas out off. Now when it comes to espresso in particular, fresher isn't always better. Because there's a lot of CO2 in very fresh coffee beans, when you try and brew them as espresso a lot of gas comes out in this pressurized environment and it can make for a disrupted brewing process. It's harder to brew really really fresh coffee and many people rest the coffee for seven to 10 days, sometimes two weeks if not sometimes longer to make it a little easier to brew for espresso. With filter coffee, it's less of a concern. A day or two fine, you know, it's pretty easy to brew from that point onwards, it gets a little bit easier, the older it is when you're trying to hit a kind of window of anywhere from a week to six weeks in which it's going to be at its best. And speaking of at its best, we need to talk also about ground coffee versus whole bean. I will always, always, always advocate for whole bean coffee for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it's better value for money. With ground coffee, they'll often pack it in a protective atmosphere, but once you open that bag and air gets in, the clock's ticking and you might have one or two days to enjoy it at its best. Yes, it's still drinkable yeah, it's probably okay for a little while more but you're not getting what you paid for. Whole beans last much longer, and when you grind them they begin to degrade but if you grind before you use them you're just going to have a better time. It's better value for money to buy whole beans. And secondly, grinding coffee is one of the great pleasures of life. You know, I don't want people to miss out on having their morning be that little bit more aromatic and enjoyable. As final guidance for whole bean coffee, anything that's a kind of light, medium roast I think is generally fine four to six to eight weeks after roasting depending on how you're storing it. If it's pre-ground, it's not going to be that case and if it's a darker roast, I would say maybe four to six weeks maximum cause dark roads go stale a little bit quicker. The second rule I'm going to give you is to buy traceable coffee. Buy coffee from a as distinct a place as you can. That might be a single farm. That might be a cooperative of growers. That might be a region in some cases, but historically coffee was just sold by country of origin. And you'd be skeptical if the wine you bought on the shelf just said, France, that's not enough, right? You would want more. Which region is this from at the very least, same with coffee. Just because the coffee is from Guatemala or Colombia. Well, it doesn't really tell you that much about how it's going to taste. There's huge variation within just about every single origin of flavor, of styles, so knowing what country it's from, isn't that useful to you. It's a little useful, but it's not that useful. If you can't tell where in a country a coffee is from it's not particularly traceable. Now the secrets of shortcut of traceable coffees is that adding traceability to a coffee keeping it separate all the way from a farm or a co-op to you, the consumer, costs money. It adds costs to that product. And that will only be done in situations where that coffee is good enough in terms of its taste and its quality to merit a premium price. There's no point keeping a coffee that doesn't taste very good traceable all the way through because it doesn't have the value necessary to kind of return on that investment. So that's why traceability I think, is a nice little shortcut to quality. I don't want to tell you how much to spend on coffee but I would say that spending more buys you generally better quality, better tasting coffee, and more of that money is likely to go back to the producer. So I'd obviously encourage you to invest a little bit in the coffee that you drink. This last tip, it's already optional, but it's kind of complicated tip, and that's to buy seasonally. Here's the deal, different countries around the world harvest coffee at different times. This means that the raw coffees are arriving into kind of consuming countries at different times of year. Raw coffee lasts longer generally than roasted coffee. And a roaster may carry a coffee from anywhere from a few weeks to six to eight months. Classically, roasters would carry a coffee all year round, right? They would have a Guatemalan offering 12 months of the year even though for, three, four, sometimes five months, that coffee wasn't very good because the raw coffee was a little bit old. Specialty has embraced the seasonality, which means that you may only see coffees from certain origins for six months of the year. I'm not going to ask you to pay attention to which country is harvesting when or understand shipping dates or that kind of stuff but do look to buy from places where the offering changes reasonably regularly. If they're doing that, if they have different products on the shelf quite often, while that can be initially frustrating it's actually a good thing. It means that the raw coffees are nice and fresh and you're going to get the best possible experience. Now let's talk about where to buy coffee. For this I'm going to say there are three kind of places to buy coffee. One is the supermarket, two would be a cafe or coffee shop or a shop on the high street let's say, or in your neighborhood. And the third place would be online. We need to talk about each of these because they impact the offering and your options and the way you should approach buying in those places. So let's start with the supermarket, right? It has a couple of big advantages. Firstly, for most people, it's incredibly convenient. They're often visiting or buying from supermarket online or you know, it's a part of your week. It's part of your kind of routine day to day and secondly, things there are generally cheaper. Supermarkets compete with each other. They're happy to use their size and their scale to diminish their profits. And so typically products in the supermarket are as cheap as they're likely to be anywhere. That's the good news. Here's the bad news. Supermarkets do not treat coffee like fresh food. As I said before, they don't want you to think about when that coffee was roasted because you might pick up a bag and think, \"Oh, this is two months old.\" But if they give you a best before date, well you might think, \"Oh, I've got 10 months left \"to use this product.\" The way supermarkets work is that they may buy from a single supplier that goes into a centralized distribution center that eventually goes to the individual supermarket, goes onto the shelf works its way slowly forwards to the front of the shelf and it can take months from it being produced to it being sold. So freshness is really, really, really difficult. You can buy good quality traceable coffee there, well roasted coffees that I would say are good coffees, definitely worth drinking but know that the trade-off is freshness. So now let's talk about coffee shops. And right now, as coffee shops around the world begin to reopen in many places, this is a great way to support them. I just wanna put that out there now. Now coffee shops have some advantages. One, you often go to them. So there's a convenience factor there. Two, there's the opportunity for a conversation. You can talk to someone and say, I like this kind of coffee. This is a brand I like or this is an experience I had that I liked, what can you recommend? And a good coffee shop should be able to help you. Now in terms of freshness, their product typically will be actually pretty fresh. It may not be as fresh as buying online and we'll come to that in a second. But if you need coffee to use right now, coffee shops are perfect. Chances are that coffee is five, six, seven days old and they certainly will have something that old that you can buy. It's beautifully fresh, perfectly ready to brew and you can take it home and have a delicious cup of coffee. Oh, wait, one more thing. Don't forget that coffee shops are often serving the coffee they retail. You know, there may be an opportunity to try before you buy it, taste something or buy something, drink it, really enjoy it, go back and take a bag of that home to enjoy in the morning. Big fan of buying from coffee shops. Let's talk about online. Now online gives you probably the most variety. It's often competitive in price. You're buying directly from a roaster and that means in many cases, though not all, but in many cases they will roast your coffee once they receive your order they'll ship it often the same day. And it will come to you a day or two after being roasted, incredibly fresh. But like we said, fresher isn't always better. If you're kind of managing the freshness and you know, you've got like a week left on this bag, great time to buy online. You know, that's a good decision. It'll come, it'll be nicely rested. You can go into that bag next, life is easy. But it requires a touch more organization. Now often roasters will offer things like subscription services. I think those are generally a great way to go. It sort of takes away having to remember to do something. Coffee just arrives through your door. That I think is a great thing to do. And often for many people they'll go through more than one bag of month. And so a great way to set up life is to have one bag come on a subscription from a roaster and then buy one bag on top of it from a different place, from a cafe or from wherever. Because the whole point that I keep coming back to is that coffee is really, really fun and tasting different stuff is really, really fun. So those are my recommendations and those are the impacts of buying on each of those different places. Now, before we move into the third section where we decode a bag of coffee, there's a short ad from this video sponsor, which is Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community full of thousands of classes for creative curious people like you and me. It's a great place to explore new skills or deepen existing passions.

So go, click the link in the description and enjoy a year of learning and creativity. Thank you to Skillshare for sponsoring this video. So let's talk about all of these bags of coffee here and work out what they're trying to tell us about how they taste. Now to kind of get a wide coverage of coffee for the video today it required a trip to the supermarket, which is always good for me to go back and look at that enormous wall of choice and try and work out what I wanted to buy. And that's kind of what we're thinking about here, right? You walk up to that big wall of coffee. You pick up a bag and you're like, will I like this? So the first thing we're going to talk about is going to be roast degree. How darkly a coffee is roasted. Generally we talk about either light or medium or dark. And in the case of supermarket coffees often they don't use that language. Often they use strength, they'll say strength five, strength three. Now they don't generally put anything down as strength one or two because no one wants weak coffee. So the functional range is generally three through five which is kind of absurd, but it is what it is. Now, specialty coffee gets very angry about the use of the word strength on the front of a bag because strength means something else. Strength is how much coffee to how much water, you know, I mean the more coffee you use to brew a cup, the stronger that's going to be. That's the correct usage of strength, but in the defense of the supermarket coffees, at least they're trying to properly communicate roasted degree to some extent for people. Specialty coffee often does not describe roast degree. Now it does, occasionally, there's a bag here that has along the bottom here, medium roast, right? That's nice but that's not common in specialty coffee. The most common thing to see is a description about whether it might be used as a filter coffee or as an espresso coffee. Now, when it comes to the term roasted for espresso that tells you a little bit regarding the coffee from that particular roaster, right? Most roasters will roast their espresso sort of focused products, a little bit darker, a little bit deeper than they would do their filter coffee roasted product. However, some people in specialty use what's called an omni-roast where they're kind of roasting for both at the same time. It's a kind of philosophy thing for many roasters their approach to espresso, to filter coffee, to roasting as a whole but if you are buying specialty coffee and it does not have any indication of roast on it, it is a light to medium roast. That's the default. On the occasions that they don't roast that way, they tend to signify that. If there's a description of roast, be it a country description which doesn't really mean anything like French roast, or just dark roast, then you know, it's different but otherwise you can presume it to be light to medium roasted. With the supermarket stuff the higher the strength, the darker the roast and generally speaking, the lighter the roast of coffee, the more acidity will have, the darker the roast the more bitterness it will have and the less acidity it will have. And, you know, specialty feels that light to medium gives you a nice sweetness a little bit of acidity, not too much bitterness and tons and tons of flavor of where the coffee comes from which is why that's such a popular roasting style choice for specialty companies. Now, we need to talk about the descriptors, and generally specialty companies and in fact, more and more commercial companies will offer you maybe three sometimes more descriptive words. Now these are doing two different jobs and I think people can forget about this. Firstly, they are trying to describe in some way the taste of the coffee. And secondly, they're trying to entice you, the buyer, to buy that bag of coffee. It's half use and it's half sales. And it's important to remember that. In some cases descriptions can be so odd or unusual or kind of contrary and clashing that that really doesn't work. But in many cases it does and things sound completely delicious. Those words promise a great deal. If you tell me my coffee is going to taste of caramel, well I expect it to taste almost as if you've put caramel in the bag. And it leads to further confusion with the consumer who thinks, \"Oh, is this like a flavored coffee?\" \"Is this like a caramel flavored coffee?\" Because those exist, but often, no, it's not. They're trying to communicate something about the coffee's tastes to you with that word. And we'll come to that a bit more very soon. One other quick tip, specialty coffee is a little bit like wine, except for one thing, the very highest priced wines are often the most elegant the most kind of classic, the most beautiful wines but they would be familiar and enjoyable to most people. The highest price coffees tend to be the most unusual, the least kind of coffee-tasting coffees. So it's just one to bear in mind. If you're looking at a more expensive coffee have a look at those words, are they promising you a very unusual experience? And is that what you want? And in some cases, yes it is. And in other cases, no, it's not. One of the things to bear in mind is that often these roasters come up with their descriptions for coffees through comparative tasting. They're not just tasting that one coffee on its own. They're comparing it to other coffees that they're also roasting and serving. Now we've talked a lot on this channel about learning to taste, there's some information up here if you want to develop your tasting skills, but comparative tasting is really useful for kind of breaking apart the flavors of coffee. But if you, the consumer don't have that comparative tasting experience when you drink it, it can feel harder to pull out the berry-qualities of a coffee or the kind of ripe pear promised by the roaster. But if you were comparing it to something else, oh, the differences would be more obvious. And yeah, this is kind of more pear-like in its way in its flavor, compared to coffee B or C or D. So know that there is an element of frustration that's almost inevitable because you won't have had the same comparative experience as a coffee roaster, but generally they're doing their best to broadcast some key information to you to help you really find out if you're going to enjoy that coffee or not. Now, what I can't do is know what your personal preferences are around, what you really, really like. What I can do, however is understand some things that you really really dislike and give you some guidance there. There are three categories of kind of coffee experience that really trigger dislike for people. I'll explain. Some people cannot stand it when a coffee is quite light bodied, quite delicate quite tea-like almost, it doesn't taste like coffee to them. And I want to help you avoid buying coffees like that if you feel that way. Now, generally specialty coffee is often of a certain roast degree as we said, it's a kind of light to medium roast and the kinds of coffees that are typically bought by specialty companies are often as a default kind of medium bodied. Generally they'll use language to highlight the texture of the coffee if it is not a kind of medium bodied coffee, if it's quite light bodied, look for words they'll use like delicate or elegant or often explicitly tea-like, like look for descriptions of things being quite floral. You know, those kinds of words suggest lightness to you. And that's what they're trying to say. And if they use kind of creamy or rich or those kinds of words then they're suggesting there's a fuller full-bodied coffee in that way. But if there's no texture words, I would say as a kind of vaguely useful rule, it's a medium bodied coffee. Now the second one I think is a much easier one to decode. And it's a much bigger love/hate aspect for a lot of people with the coffee they drink, and that is the sensation of acidity. Some people do not want any acidity in their coffee. The idea of an acidic coffee is genuinely repulsive to them and that's completely okay. There are other people who want all the acidity in their coffee. They want it to be bright and juicy and vibrant. How do we help you there? Well, it's going to be fruit-words. If you see fresh fruit words in the descriptors, there may be berries, there might be apple, right? Those kinds of fruit descriptors. If they're referring to fresh fruits, that coffee is going to have a reasonable amount of acidity. If you see berry fruits, I'd expect a lot of acidity. If you see citrus fruits, I'd expect a lot of acidity. If you see things like apple or pear, yeah, I would expect a good amount of acidity. If the words are fruit words but they're kind of transformed, if they're cooked fruit words if it's described as jammy or candied orange, for example then I would expect a little acidity, but not a lot. If a description has no fruit words then I would expect very low acidity from it. If they're using other words like caramel or treacle or nuts or chocolate, those are non-fruit words and they are suggesting low acidity in that regard. So that will you kind of decode how much acidity do I generally expect? The third kind of key aspect around sort of love/hate with coffee is what I would call fermented fruit flavors. That sounds a bit odd, but there are styles of coffee they're often dry or natural process coffees where the whole cherry was dried in the sun instead of the seeds being squeezed out and sort of washed and kind of cleaned of their fruit before being dried. If it's been dried inside the fruit then a little fermentation can go on and you can get these kind of funky very unusual flavors that are often described on bags of coffee as tropical fruit. If you see pineapple, if you see mango if you see strawberry, even chances are there's going to be some fermented fruit qualities to the coffee in the bag. If it says dry process or natural process on the bag, expect those flavors. Now, some people love those flavors. They are fascinating. They are unlike any other coffee flavors. They are easily identifiable. They're just kind of fun. Other people are completely disgusted by them and they hate them, for that reason, it's really important to me that people understand and how to not buy those or to buy those on purpose and never make a mistake. If you don't like fermented fruit flavors. And that in my experience is around 40% of people then I would strongly avoid dry or natural process coffees unless they're making a lot of promises around how clean it tastes. There's no weird fruit flavors on the bag. If they're saying it's just like clean or sweet or chocolate on nuts, maybe, but if there's any kind of fruit on there, chances are that's not going to be to your tastes and it's just a bit of a gamble, which I want you to avoid. Now I've talked a lot about the sort of theory side. The reason I bought a bunch of coffee is to use some sort of practical examples here, right? Let's take what we've discussed so far and apply it to some real world examples. This is a Kenyan coffee. It's from the supermarket, strength three. So it's going to be the lighter roast that you would get at a supermarket. Cause two in one don't really exist. It's saying zesty, citrus, and blackberry. They are broadcasting to you that this is is going to be a light to medium bodied coffee. It's going to have, for them, a lot of acidity but those fruits are kind of clean fruit tastes with it. It's not kind of funky fruit. That's what they're telling you about this coffee. And from that perspective, you may love or loathe the experience that is coming. Now, this Lavazza Rossa, very popular with a lot of people description, rich and full bodied with chocolate notes. So they're saying to you, this is a heavy bodied coffee, right? There's going to be very little acidity. There's no fruit words in here whatsoever. So they're saying no to low acidity lots and lots of body, lots of texture. They're saying intensity five out of 10, roasting medium. So you're not expecting a ton of kind of bitterness or kind of harsher more kind of developed roast flavors but it's still going to be a big kind of heavy-bodied experience. Back to this bag which I picked up before. It's a coffee from China, which is interesting. Now this is described as kind of nutty and sweet here. They say cherry, almond, candied orange and caramel, right? It's a medium roast. So what I'm expecting is reasonable texture actually like some nice body, it's a washed coffee but I wouldn't expect it to be light-bodied. In addition, it has some fruit, but they're pushing towards kind of cooked fruit, candied fruit in a way. So I would expect some acidity, but not that much. And I wouldn't expect any fermented flavors in this from their particular description. So, you know, I can kind of understand am I likely to enjoy this, or am I not? So this one is really interesting to me because this is a very big coffee company called Taylors of Harrogate, very large UK company, one of the biggest roasters in the UK doing specialty coffee. Now there's is listed right in the front as a natural. So straightaway, we know we're in for some funky flavors. We look at the back of the bag. Yeah, it says pineapple, coconut and whiskey. This is going to be a strongly fermented tasting coffee. Right, it says natural process. It's roasted for filter, it tells us that. And it also says it's a light roast. So we've got a lot of information. Natural process coffees don't often have the same acidity as washed coffees, but still, if you don't like acidity they're saying probably avoid this coffee. And if you don't like fermented flavors then probably avoid this coffee. But if you like those two things this might be a pretty safe bet. If you know, if you're buying it off the shelf especially if you're spending a little bit of money. Now, in some cases you may not have any descriptors on a bag but generally speaking specialty roasters are wise enough to the whole fermented flavors thing that they will say if it's a natural or not. And so here we know that it is an natural process coffee. So from that word alone you can make a pretty informed decision around your preferences around those styles or flavors. And then one more, one more. So here, it's an espresso roast. So we'd expect it to be darker and it is strength four suggesting it's going to be pretty darkly roasted, not all the way to very dark roasted but pretty dark, descriptors of rich chocolate, spice and toffee, so no fruit words there whatsoever. We're gonna expect really pretty low acidity they're offering, you know, by the description some kind of sweetness there, but ultimately it's not going to be a, you know a fruity or in any way, acidic espresso.", "videoID": "O9YnLFrM7Fs"}, {"title": "Tasting The Improbable\uff1a Coffee Grown In The UK", "text": "Today, we have an absolute first for me. I'm gonna taste something that I've never tasted before. Something I didn't think I would ever, ever get to taste. This is a small sample of coffee sent by the lovely people at Roastworks. They're a company, a UK roasting company out in the west of the UK or in England more specifically, and Will and I had corresponded previously in the past because they roast on a specific kind of roaster called a GW Barth. They're pretty rare. There's not many of them around, and Square Mile used to roast on one of these. We don't anymore, but we did. And we talked of it in the past. He very kindly sent me this coffee, which is coffee that is almost impossible to get any other way. This is coffee grown, harvested, processed, and roasted all in the UK. The Roastworks sort of roastery, I guess, has a very old, I think 30-year-old coffee tree in there originally from Ethiopia. And this year they tended to it a little bit more and they managed to get it to fruit. And that's generally very difficult to do. Coffee really wants to grow in a tropical climate. We'll talk more about that in a second. It's quite hard to get it to fruit in the UK, especially if it's indoors, but they succeeded. And they got about 350 grams of cherries. They did two pickings, it was interesting. And they have, as a result, some washed coffee. They did it all themselves, then they roasted on a little Ikawa. And some of it, they very kindly sent to me. I didn't really get a choice. They just told me they were sending it. And I thought, well, I have to taste it here with you. And to talk about it. I'll be honest, I've got 12 and a half grams. It's enough for one cupping bowl. I can make no mistakes here. This is my one chance to taste this. I've seen one person before taste coffee in the UK. There's a kind of biodome thing down, called the Eden Project, and they have previously harvested coffee there. I got Tristan Stephenson, who wrote a great book about coffee, and many great books about cocktails. He harvested it once and managed to get something out of it. He wasn't very complimentary about it, but it's possible. And I've seen cherries in Kew Gardens. I don't think anyone's kind of processed them to the point where I could just open a bag, grind them and brew them and taste them. Smells pleasant, actually. It smells like coffee, smells, you know, not that unusual. It's kind of a sweet, kind of caramelly smell so far. It looks relatively dark as a roast for cupping. I think that this is probably very difficult to roast. Coffee grown in the UK is likely to be relatively low in density. So in terms of roasting it, it's likely to kind of run away from you quite quickly, and develop very quickly. Coffee grows well in high altitude because at high altitude it does a couple things. It gives you lots and lots of lovely sunlight which is food for plants. That's great stuff. And then it gives you relatively cool daytime temperatures. Doesn't get too hot, and then relatively cool nighttime temperatures and that swing between sort of warm days and cool nights is really important for the slow development of coffee fruit that leads to very dense seeds that tend to taste much better. And those cool nights are also a feature of, say, island coffees, places like Hawaii, for example, where you would expect that lower altitude to have warmer nights, but because you're surrounded by water you tend to have a cooler evening because the sea, the water cools things down a little bit more. This I expect to be relatively low density. They obviously tried to keep it cool at night, so they've got AC in their facility. So I have no idea how this will taste. So let's grind it, brew it. Let's make a cupping bowl of it and let's taste it. So we've got coffee and it smells kind of interesting. It doesn't smell particularly fruity, doesn't smell at all bad. It's kind of got a chocolate and almond smell right now that is very pleasant, and a little bit vegetabley underneath there. So I don't know. It's so interesting though. This is an Ethiopian coffee variety. I don't know which one. I don't think they know either, but I don't know if it's gonna necessarily express that way lacking the terroir, the soil, the climate of Ethiopia. You wouldn't think pouring water would be stressful, but where this is a single opportunity of my entire life, I feel like there's a bit of pressure. I should just watch what I'm doing. And now to give it a smell. Still smells very pleasant, still got that kind of slightly nutty, slightly kind of chocolaty, but more in that kind of Maillard reaction where things have gone brown and toasty. Those kind of smells. Again, it is, it looks just a little darker than I would typically have roasted a coffee for cupping or tasting like this. But I don't think that's unusual with such a kind of low density coffee that probably did just get away from them in the roast a little bit, but it's not roasty, doesn't smell roasty necessarily. But I would say there's probably gonna be a little bit less acidity in the cup than may have otherwise been there. So it's time to break the coffee. We've been steeping for about four minutes. I'm just gonna stir the crust. It stops the brewing process and there's often a release of aroma that's kind of interesting. So I'm gonna smell that. Not hugely aromatic. What's there is pleasant, but it's not a big release and explosion of aroma that some coffees will absolutely give you at that moment that we call the break. The time has come to taste. I am very, very excited. This is such a rare opportunity. And I'm so sad I can't share this with other people, but here we go. Let's have a little taste. Mm, have another little taste. I'll try not to slurp too loudly. Now that tastes a little bit more as I would have expected. What's smelled quite nice here, it had really nice kind of nutty chocolaty tones, it had a little bit of a kind of a resinous aroma as well, but in the cup, what's missing is a couple of things that you really typically want in great coffee. And that is sweetness and acidity. Those two things are kind of dialed back. There's some texture to this coffee, it's got some body, it's got some mouth feel, but it leads with that. And a little bit more bitterness without the balance of sweetness and acidity. Much, much better than I thought it was going to be, If I'm honest, you know, the inside of a coffee roasting company in the southwest of the UK, that's not typically great terroir, you know, like you're not gonna be excited for the taste of place on this one, but really interesting. It doesn't have those very citrus-y, very floral notes that you tend to fall in love with with those really great washed Ethiopian coffees, but it's not unpleasant. There is some kind of green vegetableness to it as well. A little bit like a, what I would call a green bell pepper. I think other people called capsicums. It has a little bit of that that I don't really enjoy, but it is a very pleasant surprise. Really interesting and an absolute treat to taste something so rare. So improbable. You know what I mean? Like I just, I just didn't think I would ever get to taste coffee, grown, harvested, processed, roasted in the UK. What a generous gift from Will and the team at Roastworks. Thank you so much for just sending me this and not even asking if I wanted to taste it and just putting it in the mail. That was a very kind thing. Something I don't want to try and encourage too much. Please don't send me stuff. I have lots of stuff, but this, well, I'm very grateful that you did, so thank you. Now, if you're watching this and you're thinking \"I want to learn more about tasting coffee,\" I have good news. If you're watching this in the week or so after this video is published, then there's probably still time to join in on the world's largest coffee tasting. And it's an event I'm running, it'll happen on October 3rd, at 3:00 PM. UK time. You can pick up a kit, it's got five different coffees in there. Will not tell you what they are till afterwards. A little grinds humble to tell you how to grind it for cupping like this, and some Third Wave water so your water can be identical to mine so that on the day I have the same coffees as you and we can share a tasting experience wherever you are in the world. Now I'm actually gonna give away 50 kits as part of this video, because this video has an ad in it. And if you can't afford to buy a kit, there's seven pounds in the UK to be delivered. And they're not much more expensive to ship to other places, but if you really can't afford it, well, hang on and I'll tell you how to enter in a second. First, I want to talk about this video sponsor, which is Squarespace. Now, it's very easy for me to talk about Squarespace because when it came time to build a website for the world's largest coffee tasting at worldslargestcoffeetasting.com, well, I immediately went and signed up and built a Squarespace website. I took one of their templates for an event and very quickly added my images, my words, my resources, and built a website that I think is beautiful, simple, and very helpful. And there's nothing really to worry about in terms of the upkeep. I can put a PDF file of how to taste on there and not worry if 10,000 people download it in a single hour. The website isn't gonna fall over. I don't have to worry about patching, maintaining, installing stuff. It's always gonna look good on any device, on any browser. And it's just taken care of. That is a huge deal to me, but don't take my word for it. If you want to try it out, click the link down below and sign up for a free trial. Build something, create a beautiful website. And after 14 days, when you're ready to launch, use code JAMESHOFFMAN for 10% off any website or domain. Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video and enabling me to give away a bunch of coffee kits. So I have 50 available. There's a link down in the description. Just click it, enter. Please only enter if you really really can't afford this, I want to make sure these go to people who otherwise couldn't participate. There are 50 to give away. I'll send them to anywhere in the world that I can easily send coffee. And I hope more people can join in and get access to this event. If you do want to join in and you can afford a little bit of money, we've tried to make it as cheap as we can.", "videoID": "ilY4EV9Qqs8"}, {"title": "Solar Coffee Roasting\uff1a A Weird Desert Experiment", "text": "Today, we're gonna roast coffee with sunlight. Now, I know what you're thinking. Your first thought's gonna be something like this. We're not doing this. People have done that, actually. They've focused the sun's rays to roast coffee. Terrifying. We're gonna do something a little bit more practical. Maybe not practical. Something with real-world implications. I'm gonna use the sun to roast coffee with this. Now, I'm out here in California to visit Bellwether. They make this roaster. I've been an advisor to them for four or five years now, and I had this idea, and I told them, I want to take a roaster to the desert, capture the sunlight, turn it into coffee, and they agreed to help make that happen, which makes this a sponsored video, and therefore, also, because I'm using the roaster, it makes it an ad. But let me explain exactly what it is that I'm trying to do here. Now, this, this is the coffee we're gonna be roasting today. It's a Guatemalan coffee called Manos de Mujer. We're gonna give it away afterwards, so we'll tell you more about that later. So, let me show you this thing, 'cause it's so cool. This is a solar trailer, and it's kinda what it sounds like. You've got a big solar panel, not huge, but a good size, on top of the trailer, and inside the trailer are a bunch of batteries, which means that we can capture a full day's sunshine. This thing has been here since the sun came up, and we're gonna let it catch all of the day. When it gets to kind of sunset, we're gonna use what we stored and roast as much coffee as we can. And I don't yet know how much coffee that's gonna be. How viable is it to run a roaster on something like solar power? So I should probably explain why I would work with Bellwether. I have a kind of conflict here. I have a coffee roasting company that supplies cafes, and they build coffee roasting machines for cafes to roast their own coffee. Am I helping a competitor? Well, I don't really see it that way. Now, the reason that Bellwether is interesting to me is how coffee is generally roasted. Pretty much every cup of coffee drunk today is roasted using natural gas. That's what's firing the roaster, creating the heat, and often, burning the smoke that comes out of the roaster. And we use a lot of gas, and I'm not sure that's a good thing, but we haven't really considered an alternative, because for a long time, gas was cheap, gas was easy. Loads of people are using machines that were built even before the Exxon engineers worked out that, you know, what they were doing was bad for the environment. There have been electric roasters before, commercial roasters, but generally speaking, they were kind of normal gas roasters but with a different heat source, and they weren't really engineered to be the best of that kind of fuel type, and people didn't like them, and no one really considered them. And then, Bellwether came along and made me reconsider the future, because at some point, we have to stop burning gas. We have to. Either we're going to run out, or we're gonna accept that burning that much gas is just a very bad thing to do to the environment. Now, the challenge of electricity is scale. Now, that machine needs about nine kilowatts of power. That's about the same as, like, a three group espresso machine, and it roasts about three kilos of coffee at a time. And if you have a roaster that roasts maybe 90 kilos of coffee at a time, well, that seems like a difficult thing to scale. Like, you need an awful lot of electricity, that'll be a very fat cable, to make that whole thing work. As we begin to electrify everything, things like cars, I think we're beginning to understand the infrastructure needed to do it, and so that much energy is not actually a ridiculous thing to use in a commercial business. When you are using electricity, you can get it from anywhere, and so that's why I wanted to see how viable something like solar was. I wanted to just catch some free sunlight and use it, because why not? Are we gonna get much coffee out? I don't know. In fact, while we wait for the sun to set, we should probably do a little bit of maths. Welcome to my TED talk. Now, here on the whiteboard you see some beautifully rendered artistic versions of the things we're using today. We have a Bellwether roaster, we have the solar trailer, and of course, the sun. Well... The sun! We're gonna have to cover the maths of how this all works. Now, light hits the solar panel, magic happens. You know what I mean? Like, this bullying of electrons out of positions and things I don't even understand, but it's converted to energy. Now, they say on a good day we can get between 10 to 15 kilowatt hours of energy. That's the kind of way that we talk about this. So you could discharge, say, 15 kilowatts of power for one hour before you deplete what you've gained. I'm hoping we get close to 15, because it's been a beautiful sunny day. It's looking good. Now, how much are you gonna use to roast coffee? Now, I don't really have the numbers for Bellwether, we're gonna find that out in a little bit, but I do have the numbers for gas roasting. Per kilo, I think, roughly, for everything, right? Like, that's heating up roasters, running the roaster between batches, everything, we're looking at 0.8 kilowatt hours per kilo of coffee. That was quite hard to write. So if we got the maximum of 15 kilowatt hours and we use, you know, a gas roaster, we would say we would get about 18.75 kilos of roasted coffee out. But there's a problem, right? It's really hard to kind of factor in warmup in this whole thing, because every time you use a roaster, you have to heat it up, and that uses really quite a lot of energy, and the more batches you do after the warmup, the more efficient that warmup was per kilo. Today, we're not gonna have that much energy, we're not gonna be able to roast like 20 batches of coffee, so our warmup's gonna be pretty impactful. I think that it will take about half an hour to heat the roaster. This roaster pulls 9.5 kilowatt hours, and so half of that, 'cause half an hour, would be 4.5 kilowatts of energy just to get it hot, which feels stressful. If we've got only 15, we've gotta use basically a third of what we've captured to heat it up. The question is gonna be, how efficient is it once it's running? How much coffee can we actually roast from a reasonably small solar panel from one day's energy? As the sun sets, we're gonna find out. As you can see, the sun is gone from the sky. I checked the battery. We got just under 14 kilowatt hours of energy, which I think is is pretty good. I'm pretty happy with that. Now, I have to be honest with you I would be terrified to do this with most roasting machines, because frankly, I'm not a coffee roaster. I've never really claimed to be a coffee roaster. I have an involvement in a coffee roasting company, but it's not me in front of the roaster every day cranking out batch after batch. That's not my skillset. So the idea of roasting a bunch of coffee that I don't know super well on a machine that I don't know super well that loads of people will taste should be terrifying. But it's kind of not. This is a a perfect machine for me right now. Once it's preheated, it's gonna be time to roast, the moment of truth, we'll have used, I think, around four and a half kilowatts of that 14 to start with. I don't know what we'll get out of the remaining kind of nine and a half. We will see. All I have to do for this whole thing to work is, there's a bunch of profiles of different coffees loaded here, I'm gonna select the one that has my name on it, cause that's the one we worked on. And then there's pre-heat temperature, all of that kind of stuff, and once it reaches pre-heat temperature, as long as there's coffee in the hopper, then it'll start roasting. We should put some coffee in the hopper. It has begun. Now it's like I do nothing but like eight minutes. I feel useless. In a good way! We're nearly there! Six seconds left 'til the first roast is done. The game today is gonna be speed. How quickly can we turn it around, get more coffee done? We have coffee! Batch number one is done. Batch two complete! So I just did a quick check after the second batch, and for the roasting process, from the start where the coffee goes in until it comes out roasted, it used roundabout .3 kilowatts per kilo of green coffee, which is good. It certainly says the more we'd be able to roast continuously, the more efficiency we would obviously get. We are making our lives slightly complicated by running this light on the solar battery, because we're in the desert and there's no electrical sockets and that's probably, like, 500 watts of power. Maybe a little bit less now, but that's having an impact, so I'll kind of work it out at the end, and we'll be able to calculate how much this used, how much this used, how much coffee we got. It's getting cold. I think I need a jacket. We've got 15 kilos of coffee with us. I'm feeling very confident we're gonna get through all of it today. This is about to be the fourth batch going in. We've been resting for about an hour now, and so, couple batches left. It's going well. So batch five, the final batch for the day, or night, is in the cooling tray, and I just checked the battery, and we've used pretty much exactly what we captured today to get to this point. I think. I need to check with the light. That's a little bit confusing. Now, I'm not gonna lie to you. I made the call that we would make this final batch, we're gonna cheat slightly and use a little bit more energy, because we're gonna cool this down sensibly and properly. I won't use that much energy, but it will use more than we captured today, technically speaking. I just want to be above board. So we're gonna get it all packed up, everything packed down. For some reason, we thought it would be a good idea to actually stay out here in the desert, so I'm gonna go to bed in the lonely darkness, and I'm slightly terrified of that. But I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Good morning. I'm not gonna lie to you. The coffee we roasted last night tastes a little bit fresh. It also tastes very satisfying. I am kind of delighted by the fact that we turned sunlight into coffee, and more coffee than maybe I really, deep down, thought we were gonna get. The coffee itself, as I said, we'll give away. There's a link in the description down below to Bellwether's site where you can sign up to kind of enter to win and they'll contact you directly if you do win some of this coffee. It's just a very nice, sweet, clean, delicious coffee. I didn't wanna pick something that was kind of distractingly weird or unusual. I wanted people to taste the kind of roast development for a light roast and see what they think. This whole experiment, to me, has been a success, and the point of this is not to try and convince people to switch immediately to electric roasting, or is not to argue that electric roasters are more efficient than gas roasters. The point of this whole thing was about possibility to me. To me it's about change in the future and how we start now to adapt to the change that we need. I don't see us switching away from gas in the very near future. It's just too cheap, it's too embedded in what we do. But we have to at some point accept burning liquified squished dinosaurs is not the right way to roast delicious sustainable coffee, and I'm interested in kind of pushing for that change without compromising the taste of the coffee. And so this experiment for me was just around, can we do it? Is it viable? Could you put some solar panels on a roof and have a battery and turn a day's sunlight in a cafe into a day's coffee? And yeah, depending where in the world you are, yes, for sure, but you could take a day's wind, probably, or a day's, you know, tidal energy, or whatever renewable source and turn it into coffee if you're not reliant on burning gas. I had a good time.", "videoID": "qV0bJHizJBA"}, {"title": "How To Make The Best Coffee At Home", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about my new book. I'm very excited and if you look at the title, you'll see why this video is not click bait and I want just a minute to tell you all about it 'cause I'm very excited, but honestly, I feel like this - this is not the place to do it. This is literature, we should go somewhere a little grander. Now, I might agree with you if you said we could have had a more creative title for the book, but I feel like you know what this book is about just from looking at the cover. I've been working in coffee now for nearly 20 years and learning about coffee, teaching about coffee and this book is the kind of concise summary of everything that I think is important to help you make great coffee at home. But you might ask who exactly is this book for? Now, it's written really for anyone that makes coffee at home and who likes the idea that it could be a little bit better. It is divided into six different sections and section one covers how to buy great coffee. You walk up to a wall of retail and it can easily feel overwhelming. I wanna help you find the thing you really love and avoid the thing you really won't. Section two is the essentials for great coffee at home. Coffee equipment, what is essential? Where are there kind of great value items? Where are the kind of nice to haves? Now, section three is about how to taste coffee. Developing your sense of taste, developing your palette around coffee is really useful. It's not only fun. It doesn't just make coffee more enjoyable, but it actually helps make you a better coffee brewer day-to-day 'cause you can understand the changes that you're making. Now, section four is of course how to brew great coffee with the most popular brewing methods out there. We'll give you step-by-step guides as well as recipes and tips and tricks to help you make sure you're getting the best out of every brew. Section five is about iced coffee and cold brew. Now, I think iced coffee is something we could be drinking all the time and it's definitely something we should be making at home. And then of course there is espresso. It's a pretty big chapter on espresso because it's not just the step-by-steps. We actually start with understanding espresso machines, how to buy the right espresso machine for you, how to buy the right grinder and then we get into the theory of espresso. So you understand what you're doing and why, which turns it from a fussy finicky hobby, into an absolute pleasure and delight first thing in the morning. And that, I think, pretty much covers it. Now I'm not gonna pretend that if you've watched every YouTube video, if you've absorbed that information, if you are a skilled, skilled home brewer that this book is gonna be truly essential to you. But if you learn best from the written word, if you need a gift for a coffee loving friend, if you wanna support the stuff that we do on this channel, then I hope this is the perfect book for you. Now to celebrate its launch, we have signed a staggering number of books and these, we will be dispatching all over the world to warehousing for you. Thank you very much. Now it's really important to us that these warehouses are as close to as many of you as possible to try and keep shipping rates as cheap as possible. We have three warehouses. One is in the US. One is in the UK and one is in Europe and I hope that keeps shipping fees down, but if you are concerned about price, honestly, the cheapest place to buy it is Amazon. There's a link in the description to Amazon down below and there's a link to the signed copies as well that will take you to the correct place wherever in the world you are. And for fans of audiobooks, don't worry, we've got you covered. So we're back, let's talk about release dates. Now in the UK, the release date is September 15th, that means stock from pretty much everywhere ships September 14th, so it's arriving in most places September 15th. Europe, we'll be aiming to do the same thing but shipping may take a little bit longer. In the US, the release date is technically October 4th, which is a little bit later. We're gonna try and get them out as early as is possible without making the publisher very cross because, you know, they tend to embargo these things but we're gonna ship as soon as we can. Linked down below are my Twitter and Instagram, they're the easiest places I'll be kind of updating stuff, like release dates and shipping dates for the US copies. So if you wanna know what's going on, check in down there. Now we did also build a website for the book. That will give you an idea of a bit more about what's in it, a little bit more about the photography that's inside it, kind of a feel for the whole thing and speaking of the photography, we needed a lot of props to shoot all the photographs in this book and we kept as many of them as we could and we're gonna give them away. We're gonna kind of bundle them up into eight different bundles and give them away to you, lovely people all around the world. For details on how to win one of those bundles of props of coffee equipment, then there's a link in the description down below and that's it. That's this announcement. I am really excited to get this out into the world. Inevitably also like a little bit terrified.", "videoID": "X9tg3J5OiYU"}, {"title": "The Best Water for Coffee - An Introduction", "text": "Today we're gonna be talking about the best water to use, to make the most delicious cup of coffee. If that's made you roll your eyes and you're thinking, \"Ah, now I have to worry about the water that I brew with. It was already complicated enough.\" Well, know that this topic makes me kind of angry, more frustrated than anything else. I wish it were easy. I wish that any water would make any coffee taste good, but that isn't the case. And using water that has some problems means that you're not gonna extract the coffee that you buy, or you're gonna make the coffee that you extract taste much worse. So you're gonna ask, what makes water good or bad? Surely if it tastes clean and pleasant, then it's good. If it tastes kinda chloriny and disgusting, then it's bad. And that is true, but it is unfortunately a bit more complicated than that. But if you do know a little bit about water chemistry and coffee, know that we're not gonna get super hardcore into the chemistry today. So let me give you a very quick overview, that is so simple, that I might feel like I'm lying to you. There are two aspects to water and its contents that are particularly important when it comes to brewing coffee. The first are the mineral ions. Most commonly, we're gonna talk about calcium and magnesium. These are really useful ions. If they're in the water, they actually help with the extraction of the coffee flavors, helping them go into solution, to create a delicious cup of coffee. If you have no mineral ions, you'll have very little extraction compared to having a lot of ions and then having a lot of extraction. But that doesn't mean that more is necessarily better. Now the other thing to really worry about is what's called the bicarbonate or alkalinity of the water. This refers to the ability of that water to sort of buffer its pH, to maintain its pH around about seven. If you have a lot of bicarbonate, if you have a lot of alkalinity, it'll take a lot more acid added to that to turn the solution acidic. In the case of coffee, well, coffee is pretty acidic. When you extract a bunch of stuff in coffee, those are acids. It has a low pH when you brew it. So the more buffer that you have, the less acidity ultimately you'll experience in your cup of coffee. And again, more does not equal better. Too little bicarbonate is a problem. Those acids in the coffee will run rampant. They'll be uncontrolled, unbalanced, unpleasant. Too much buffer, then everything is just kind of boring, dull, brown tasting, to be avoided. With both of these things, there's a middle ground where things tend to taste pretty great. So what is that? What is the perfect water? Again, I can't give you a very simple answer for that. Firstly, I will say, if you buy from one roaster continuously, if you buy their coffee all the time, find out what their water is like. Matching your water to theirs as much as is possible or practical will get you much closer to those notes that they're writing on the bag. If you're brewing with water that's a long way away from theirs, you'll just have a very different taste experience to them, which can be a little bit frustrating. As for what might be a good guideline, well, again, it's tricky, because calcium and magnesium, while they are both mineral ions, well, they're a little bit different. They don't do the same job exactly. And having the same amount of calcium in one water as you have magnesium in another will produce different tasting cups of coffee when you brew with those two waters. Generally speaking, a little bit more calcium is preferable if that's your primary ion, a little bit less as preferable if magnesium is your primary iron. There are ways to tell how much stuff is in your water. You can very cheaply get a TDS kit, but that's not terribly helpful. A TDS meter will give you the total dissolved solids for the water, but it won't tell you what those solids are. Could be all calcium, could be all magnesium, could be all, something else that happens to conduct electricity. It's not very insightful. Aside from TDS meters, there are really two ways that you can know about the composition of your water. Firstly, if it's coming out of your tap, well in many parts of the world, you can put in your postcode or your zip code into your water authorities website, and they will give you an exhaustive breakdown of the minerals inside that water. That is definitely useful. It's usually free in most parts of the world. Go and check that out. That's essential. If the water has been treated or softened in some way, then pretty much the best way to assess it is with a dropper kit. They're pretty cheap. I'm gonna make sure there are links available, and you take a sample of water and you add drops to it until it changes color. And those droplets give you an indication of total hardness and carbonate hardness. So those can be converted so you can find out sort of how much mineral hardness is in there and how much bicarb is in there too. Really useful, not incredibly accurate, but will certainly get you to a useful place. So let's take an example. Let's take my water. Let's say it's 300 parts calcium. It's got a really high level of bicarbonate. What should it be? What should I be aiming for? If I'm trying to treat this water, where should I be going? And that's a really difficult thing to tell you, right? I like just to give you some numbers, we'll give you a recipe, but there is no one answer. All of this exists in a range, in a spectrum. And so if I was talking about calcium, I might say 30 to 50 parts calcium is good. But if it was magnesium, I might say more like 15 to 30 parts per million or milligrams per liter is good. Similarly with buffer, I might say somewhere between 50, 75, maybe PPM. So, while that's my recommendation, know that there are other recommendations. There are specs that are used in international coffee competitions that are available online. The SCA, the specialty coffee association, they offer a guideline, a kind of range for various things when it comes to water quality. That's free and available online. So check that out too. And if you really want to experiment at the end of all of this, well, we'll do talk about that. We'll talk about creating your own custom mineral water and how you might do that, but we'll save that to the end. So let's talk about treating water in the home, right? Many people have bought things like Brita water filters and does some extent for some good reason. You know what I'm talking about, these things. And these things are not what you want them to be. They're not a solution and they're not an easy fix, but they're not entirely bad. These things do a little bit of softening, but not too much. They definitely improve the taste of the water, if your water has off tastes like chlorine or other unpleasant flavors, but they don't really do a great job softening. So I'm not against them, but they don't fix the problem. And bear in mind, the problem with hard water is not just that it doesn't make great tasting coffee, the problem with hard water is limescale. And when it comes to coffee machines, espresso machines, filter machines, heating that water up causes limescale to precipitate out, and that can easily damage, break, clog, frustrate your coffee machine. In case you're curious how these things work, well, we can take out a filter from these things and we'll cut it open and we'll talk you through what's going on inside one, 'cause I just think that's interesting. So here's your familiar Brita filter. And if we just open it up like this, you can see that they're not particularly complicated things inside. At the top here, you've got a pretty simple filter mesh. That is just like a tiny sieve to remove any particular matter. Make sure there's no floaty bits in the water as it goes into the main filtration section. And below that there are lots of these little tiny kind of beads and there's two types here. Now I'm pretty confident that the darker ones are active carbon. They're essentially kind of charcoal. And what they do is mop up off tastes. Any kind of chloriny flavors will get cleaned up by active carbon. If you see something is charcoal filtered for flavor, that's what's going on. The other little beads are, essentially ion exchange beads. They're negatively charged and they attract the calcium. And in their place release a sodium ion. Now that doesn't make the water salty typically. You're not releasing sodium chloride, which is table salt. You're just releasing these sodium ion on its own. That does not form limescale. And there's no health concerns or anything like that with your salt intake, don't worry about this stuff. It's just a nice way to essentially switch out a calcium for a sodium. It will do an okay job, but it is finite, right? At some point it will release all of the sodium that it has. And so it will not do any more softening. And even brand new fresh, they're not super, super effective with very hard water. So what else can we do? Well, you could add in a commercial water filter at home, but most of the time that's just doing what the Brita filter is doing on a much larger scale. And it does make it much more effective, but it also makes it way, way more expensive. And then you have options like reverse osmosis and I'll do my best to explain it quickly. You press your mineralized water against a mesh that is so fine that only water can get through, but the minerals can't. It's applied with pressure and anything else essentially runs off down the side of the filter and out and becomes waste. Reverse osmosis units are incredibly wasteful. What you get out of it though is nearly pure water. Which again, isn't actually ideal. If you put distilled water into a coffee machine, well that's typically bad because it can become quite corrosive. And again, we know that we need some minerals in order to get the best tasting coffee from an extraction perspective. So pure ARO is not desirable. And there are some home units available. And I'll be looking at a couple in the not-too-distant future. But in most cases they produce water that's actually too soft. It'll taste fine. And it won't be so soft that it's actually corrosive, but it won't be the best possible water. You may need to find some way to remineralized it, which can be complicated. So again, that's not a great solution. If your water's just a little bit hard, it's not super hard, then something like a Brita is kind of actually okay and not a terrible solution. It'll get you kind of ballpark, but certainly harder waters, they are a frustration. So what else are your options? Well, there's one option that's pretty popular, but it is one of my least favorites. It's inelegant, frustrating, wasteful, environmentally unsound. And that of course is bottled water. In Europe and many parts of the world, it's a kind of requirement in bottled water to put the mineral content on the label, often on the back. And they'll give you the exact quantity of magnesium and calcium and your bicarbonate and a bunch of other stuff in milligrams per liter, which is really useful. And you could go out and find a mineral water that works well for you. I quite like this one, even though it's way low on the mineral content, but it still makes good tasting coffee. But do remember, you're looking for a balance, a balance of those minerals and that bicarb. There are plenty of waters out there that have what seem like the right mineral content, but have inadequate bicarb. They producing that's harsh and acidic and a kind of unpleasant way. So to be avoided. But, I just can't recommend this to you. I can't in all good consciousness, in good faith, recommend something that is ultimately wasteful and environmentally unsound. It's definitely a solution. And if you are occasionally in need of some special water or some better brewing water, yes, mineral water is an option. But, I just feel like it's a very stupid solution to a problem, but I can't deny it's a solution. And so I have to talk about it here. So what else have we got? Well, one option is to get water from a local cafe or a local roastery that treats its water. Not every business is gonna do this for you. Not every business is gonna be interested in that, but I hope more and more get on board with the idea of sharing the water that they're making. Now I don't think I could ask a cafe to give that away for free. There is a cost for them in creating good tasting water for coffee. So I would expect to pay something, not just expect them to give you two, three, five liters of water for free, but talk to your local cafe. They may be open to this. Now we've covered a lot of ground here. There's a lot of information and you may want to do some more reading. So I've put together a kind of reading list on my website, a website that I built with today's sponsor, which is Squarespace. If you need to build a website that is beautiful, elegant, personal, and robust, then I would recommend Squarespace. They've helped me build multiple websites now that have showcased the work that I've done in the form of a book or the work that I do day to day. So even if it's a portfolio of your art or you wanna showcase your hobby or the thing that you're passionate about, or you wanna showcase your business, your cafe, your restaurant, it doesn't matter. Squarespace is a great way to start with your idea and your identity. Take a template and turn those two things into a unique and beautiful website. Don't take my word for it.

Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. Now, we're getting pretty low on options, on solutions to the particular problem, but there is one big one left that I do need to talk about, but there's no way I can really, really get into it without doubling or tripling the length of this video. So perhaps when we'll talk more about in depth in the future. And that is about creating in your own custom mineral water. If you joined me for the world's largest coffee tasting, which we may do again soon, then you've already been through that experience of buying pure demineralized water and adding a sachet minerals to it in order to create a custom recipe. And doing that in that case, let people all around the world brew with identical water, which I thought was just the coolest thing. But you don't even need a sachet as much as third wave water is a nice little solution that is available just off the shelf. If you wanna go harder than this, you can. You can get a bunch of distilled water and go and buy your individual components. For the mineral content, you can use magnesium in the form of Epsom salt, that's cheap and easy to get hold of. And for the bicarbonate, you can just use sodium bicarbonate, which is baking soda, which is incredibly cheap and easy to get hold of. And you can very simply put a small amount of those into distilled water, and then carefully dilute that down again into a much larger quantity of distilled water to accurately, very carefully compose mineral water. Now I just can't talk about this subject without giving an enormous shout out to Barista Hustle. Many of you are familiar with Barista Hustle, it's Matt Perger is kind of coffee brain trust that puts out enormous amounts of information into the world. If you are not aware of it, go to baristahustle.com right now, and stop watching this video and go and learn some really cool stuff. They did a ton of work on composing your own water. They really popularized this. They have calculators to do it yourself to create your own recipes. They have calculators for taking very soft water from your tap and mineralizing it a little bit more to get it into a really good zone for coffee brewing. This is unquestionably extreme as a solution. It's a little bit expensive to buy demineralized water. It's a little bit of your time and effort to do this stuff. It requires accuracy and patience and a willingness to do it, but the results are really, really interesting and are definitely enjoyable when it comes to making delicious coffee in the morning. It's really nice to just not worry about the quality of water that you're brewing with. And if you live in a hard water place, that's an almost unimaginable thought. So go and check out Barista Hustle, have a little look at that. There are recommendations from various people like Scott Rao and others on their recommended water and recipes. And you can begin to understand how wide a range there is around this. And one more shout out has to go to Maxwell Colonna-Dashwood and Christopher Hendon, who put together the kind of seminal work, which is water for coffee, which really dug into what's doing what and why. It gives you a great primer on water chemistry. I think it's pretty hard to get hold of at the moment, but I'll stick some links in the description down below. If you really want to understand this a little bit more, I think it is great reading. And again, this is not entirely new. I remember reading great stuff by Jim Schulman, way, way, way back in the early two thousands. He'd done a bunch of work on this stuff too. It's been a known problem for a long time. Water really is the most frustrating thing. It can hold you back from getting out the value and quality that is in the bag of beans that you bought. It drives me kind of crazy that it seems so simple, but it's so complicated. And little changes can have a massive, massive impact. And you know what don't believe me, think this is all a nonsense, go and brew two cups of coffee, get a French press brew. Two cups of coffee, one with soft water, one with hard. It's not difficult to do. And it will ruin your day, because the difference is enormous. And it's not just tasteable by professional tasters or coffee geeks or obsessives, it's anyone. Everyone can taste the difference between good water and bad, but I'd like to hear your thoughts. What are you doing for water at home? You just use the tap water. Is it soft enough or is it hard? Do you feel frustrated sometimes that the coffee you make simply is not as good as the coffee from the local coffee shop? That certain sparkle, that certain sweetness that their coffee has, you just can't get no matter how good your gear and how good your technique. And so I hope this is a useful introduction to the topic. Let me know what I missed.", "videoID": "jfElZfrmlRs"}, {"title": "Weird Coffee Science - Centrifuging Espresso", "text": "Welcome to today's episode of Weird Coffee Science. Now, usually these are designed in a way that you can replicate the experiments at home. This is not the case this time. This one, you need some lab grade equipment. Now I'm regretful. My friend, Bill, happens to have in his kitchen a lab centrifuge, for many good reasons that involve delicious cocktails, but he has kindly lent the centrifuge to me for today. So I'm gonna get appropriately attired to do some proper science. And now, lab coat on, I'm of course perfectly dressed to make some espresso which is what we're gonna start with. So here's the thing, here's the thing that I'm interested in today. We talk a lot about the oils in espresso, about how good they're, about how wonderful they are, about how that's one of the best bits of espresso. But I'm curious what the oils on their own are actually like. So here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna make a bunch of espresso. We're then gonna put that into these little things and put them inside the centrifuge. This will then separate the oil from the liquid, from the solids that are suspended in the espresso as well. And I will have a little taste of both of those things and see what we see. So to do that, I'm gonna need to make some espresso which is what I'm gonna get on with now. So in this jug, I now have a hundred grams, a little bit more actually of espresso. I'm not too worried about crema or anything like that. That's just foam, that's just gas trapped in coffee that can go away. That's not the important bit. So we've got lots of good espresso. So now we have to put it into the centrifuge. And to do that, we have to wear it very carefully. They really have to be the same weight, the two kind of buckets that face each other inside the rotor. If they're out of rack, the whole thing is very dangerous. It'll be kind of unstable. So they've got to weigh the same to within at least a 0.1 of a gram. So now it's time to load the machine. We're just gonna put two in, you can run up to four, but we're just gonna do two this time. So these are now ready to spin. So this first time we're gonna run it for about 15 minutes to see what we get. Around and around we go. So this will get up to about four, four and a half thousand RPM, maybe. We'll let that run for 15 minutes. so we're done, it's spinning down. It's gonna eventually stop. Then we can take out a tube, and see what we can see. That's Ooh, interesting. Got some solids at the bottom here. And there's just a very thin layer here at the top of oil which is exactly what we wanted. Oh wow, it's actually semi solidified. Like it's acting like a little floating cap of fat on top of the shot, it's a little girl. This is kind of gross. It's like a gooey, almost gelatinous fatty layer. So there's really only one thing left to do, for science and that's to eat this, drink this, feed this. It feels like eat as I look at this right now. I can't pretend to be appetized. But hey, coffee oil in espresso. It's the best. Oh no! That's very bad. That might actually make me cry. That is, that is incredibly bitter. There were obviously a lot of very oil soluble, bitter compounds. And now I have a kind of greasy, bitter mouth. Don't say it. I should try the liquid underneath. Maybe that's better without the oil. I don't know. You mean it's like a paper filter to espresso but not. What is wrong with me? No, no, it's like a, it's fine. Much better than, oh, the oil. I still have a lot of bitterness in my mouth. And I feel like there's definitely been some degradation of the espresso in the last 15 minutes. It's cold, which sort of amps up bitterness as well. But otherwise it's quite a nice shot. The liquid underneath is fine. That is not a ringing endorsement for the oils present in espresso. They don't make the crema. We'll have to discuss crema in depth one day, but oils don't make a crema. Oils cause problems with crema, actually. They certainly add texture to an espresso, but they also are bringing some interestingly negative flavors that was they're dispersed out into the rest of these espresso, they're okay. But on their own. No, not good, not good. So we have experiment to do, but I just need to tell you about this video sponsor, which is Squarespace. When it's time for me to build a website, be it for the world, artists of coffee, or even just for me, I use Squarespace. And I use it because they have a host of templates that make building something beautiful, but building something just for me really, really easy. It doesn't matter what you wanna do. If you wanna share a portfolio if you wanna sell the product that you design if you wanna showcase your cafe, your restaurant or anything that you do, I think Squarespace is a fantastic way to do it. With nothing to patch, nothing to upgrade, nothing to worry about in the future and 24 seven email support for when you do have a question that needs answering, they are an incredibly supportive service and I recommend them highly.

Thank you so much for Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So here's experiment two. What happens if you clarify or separate grounds from water with a centrifuge? Now this is my idea. A gentleman called Yohanas had emailed me, saying he had access to a lab grade centrifuge and he wanted to know what would happen. What kind of ratios to use to sort of steep ground coffee and water together and then spin to separate. Because in that last brew, all the solids got pushed to the bottom. So what if that's something we can do to sort of make a nice brew? Here's how it's gonna work. I've got some coffee, I'm gonna grind it. And then I'm gonna take about two grams, add it to each one of the tubes inside the buckets. I'm gonna add about 30 grams of water, seal it up, give it a quick shake and then get it in the centrifuge. That should give it long enough at a very fine grind to steep and infuse, but then very quickly be separated. And when it's separated, it should stop extracting. So this is espresso grind. It's the same grind set we used to pull shots a minute ago. 'Cause I think we're gonna have a pretty short brew time if these are going straight in. 261.24, so point four, acceptable. Okay, it's a little slower to get sorted than I had hoped. This should not be good. Let's just try it for five minutes, five minutes. Actually, maybe let's just get it up to speed and then slow it down again, and see if it's even separated at that point. Oh yeah. I mean that is very, very separated. A little bit of our friend, the coffee oil on top. Not what I was hoping for. Not too much coffee oil, which nice. It smells good. Cheers! I mean, this is crystal clear. That was pretty good. It was pretty good. I mean, it's actually a little weak, a little under extracted ironically, but that is a very clear liquid. All right, I have to do this again with, I think a longer brew time or a bit more agitation. And then I think we're onto something. We're just gonna run this again very quickly. I felt that that previous version was a little under extracted. So I'm gonna add my hot water, make sure that the buckets were exactly the same, but then give the tubes a little shake and then get them straight into centrifuge and spinning, spinning, spinning to do that incredible job of separating the grounds and the liquid. Let's go. Have they separated? Oh, Ooh. I feel a little bits of something floating in there. Looks good. It smells good. That agitation has definitely helped increase our extraction right up to the limit. Actually that tastes very well extracted. The first one, not as much. This, yes. But it's good, it's clean. Like blindfolded, I would have no idea this hadn't been through a paper filter. Now that's interesting just to have a quick look at the TDS and the extraction approximately. We're pretty high extraction on that. It's showing something like a 23 and a half 24% extraction, which is high. Typically it's really, really hard to do infusion brewing with very finely ground coffee because they don't separate very easily. The one, I guess, counter to this is kind of brick brewing, which does that but they don't really separate the same way and you end up with a very differently textured beverage. This didn't taste as intense and strong as it is because it was so clean. That's interesting. Let's summarize what we've learned from today. We talk up oils and espresso a lot, but on their own oils and espresso are very bad, very bad. And we should think about that and maybe not lavish them with praise as if they're the most important aspect of the beverage. That was interesting for sure. As for the idea of using a centrifuge as a way to separate grounds and water, as a kind of filtration method. Definitely interesting because you can easily separate very, very, very finely ground coffee from water in a way that it's usually hard to do. Paper filters don't work, they clog. It's hard to get them through things like espresso machine baskets. You need huge amounts of pressure. Here, we did it a different way. And the result was very, very, very clean. It was very interesting. It tasted good. Undoubtedly, it tasted good. But that's not really a practical thing, is it? I mean, it's fussy. It's hard to make sure that your buckets are balanced. It's not easy, but it was interesting. I hope you found it interesting too.", "videoID": "j8J_0OTmXQg"}, {"title": "How To Cup (Taste) Coffee At Home", "text": "Hi there. Today, we're going to talk about how to set up a coffee cupping at home. Now, a coffee cupping is a specific sort of coffee tasting used really commonly in the coffee industry at all sections of the value chain. It really refers to a specific way of brewing, as well as tasting, and we're not going to try and replicate all of it, we're going to cherry-pick the best bits so that we can put on a really simple cupping and do comparative tasting, and that's really the key. The key to developing your sense of taste is to taste different coffees side by side, and this is the easiest way to do that. The coffee industry uses cupping in a host of different ways: a buyer will cup coffees at origin when looking for different lots that they might want to purchase; an importer may cup coffees to make sure that what arrived matches the pre shipped sample; a roaster may cup coffees as part of their quality control process to make sure that they're roasting has been up to scratch, and; a cafe may cup coffees to decide which coffees they want to put on their menu. Now as I said, there are a ton of protocols and rituals around a cupping in the industry, we don't need to replicate all of those; we're gonna take the most important bits to get to a nice comparative cupping. So in this video, I'll walk you through what you need in terms of equipment (and I think you'll have most of it at home already). I'll walk you through the brewing process, how we're gonna brew coffee in a cupping. And then I'll walk you through the basic steps of how to cup several coffees side-by-side. This is going to be a two-part video; this is really the practicalities of setting up a coffee tasting at home, what you need and how to do it. The second part is going to be about taste itself: acidity; sweetness; exploring those things, diving in in much more detail. But this one? This part is just the practicalities of getting set up. So, the first thing you're going to need is a kettle. Doesn't matter whether it's a expensive kettle, cheap kettle; it doesn't have to be a gooseneck kettle, just a regular domestic kettle is completely fine. Make sure you fill this with fresh cold water, that's nice and soft, and is good tasting. That's important too. Next thing you're gonna need is a weighing scale and you want to be weighing both coffee and water with it, so something accurate to .1 of a gram is ideal. And then you're gonna need a coffee grinder. now in an ideal world You want a grinder this design to grind through everything that you put in it, that doesn't really retain any coffee. If you have a grinder that does retain coffee and you've got a hand grinder, in this situation a hand grinder might be better. And then you need some sort of spoons. Now, it can be something like a coffee cupping spoon. These are designed for coffee cupping but that's not actually that necessary. It's perfectly good to just use a dessert spoon or a soup spoon. And if you want to... you could use something really fancy, but that's not a requirement, you just need something of this kind of size and you need a few of them. And then. we need something to brew in. Now the industry uses these, they're called cupping bowls. It's nothing special. It's nothing fancy. It's basically a sugar bowl. It's a bowl of about 250ml in volume, and that's it. You don't need to use something like this, but if you've got a bunch of these or something like it, then that's great. But you can use a heatproof glass if you want to; lots of people like to use that. But if you have neither of those things, then you can brew in just a regular mug. That's fine, and it can even be a pretty big mug, but you'll have to make some changes and adapt your recipe a little bit as you go. But all you need is ideally five or six of roughly the same size things and to know how big they are. And then the last thing you need... ...is some coffee. Now, I have to be clear here, what you don't have to do is this; you don't have to go and buy three full bags, four, five, six, full bags of different coffees. You can get away with getting hold of say, 20 grams of one particular coffee and that's enough for you to cup with it. Now, the ideal number, I would say if you're starting out, is maybe four or five. I wouldn't try and get a hold of ten different samples if you're just getting used to kind of cupping coffee side-by-side. Three is enough, two is enough, actually, to have some interesting learning, but I think four or five is really the best. Just do what you need to do to get four or five little samples of coffee to taste. Go and talk to your local coffee shop. A lot of them are pretty interested in talking to you if you're enthusiastic about tasting coffee, and you only want a few grams to do it with. If you've got friends that buy a good coffee, trade with them! There's loads of different ways to do it, but all you need is a little bit of a few different things. That's really the key. So let's talk about how you're gonna brew coffee for your coffee cupping. And if you've seen my french press technique video, a lot of this is going to be very, very, very familiar. Now there's two ideas behind the way that we brew coffee in a cupping. One, it's the way to brew coffee that has the least human interaction, right? What we don't want to do is brew coffee in a way where our technique can impact taste. Pour-overs are great, but how you brew a pour-over can make it sweeter or more acidic, so at what point are you tasting the pour over, and at what point are you tasting the coffee? The other big idea behind this whole thing is scalability; to brew five pour-overs would not only be time consuming, it would be really annoying, let alone trying to do 10 or 20. This is a way that we can brew several coffees at the same time, and its really, really, really easy. So, what's the method? Well, it couldn't be simpler. We're going to grind some coffee, kind of in the finer end of medium fine, and we're gonna pour some hot water on it and let it steep for about four minutes, just like a French press. Then, there'll be a crust that forms on the top and we'll stir it after four minutes, clean off anything that's left floating, and then we have a bowl of coffee, or a mug of coffee, or a glass of coffee, ready to taste. So the key things here are recipe and ratio. Now, I'm going to recommend a ratio of 60 grams per liter. Now, usually for an infusion brew like this, I would recommend 75 grams a liter, but here, brewing a little weaker actually makes the tasting process a little bit easier. And then you got recipe, right? So if you've got, say, a 240-250ml bowl, you don't want to use 240-250ml of water. You want to use 200 and that would be 12 grams of coffee And when you brew that 12 grams of coffee, it'll bloom; a foam will appear and it will swell up in size. What that volume is typically three times to four times the weight of the coffee, and it will vary a little bit, so that twelve grams will easily take up 40ml plus two 200 equals a very full bowl in a 240 ml bowl. If you don't have five or six cups, or bowls, that are the same size and shape, that's okay You can use a whole bunch of different sizes if you want to. You got two choices, Either, pick the smallest size, in this case, 10 grams to 160, and do that in all the vessels, or you could scale up and down. This is pretty much twice the size, so I'd do 20 grams to about 330 grams of water. Choice is yours, whatever's easier for you. Now when it comes time to weigh beans, weigh them into the vessel you're gonna be brewing in later. It's just an easy way to keep them organized as you prep up. I would say you want to be accurate to ideally your target weight give or take .1 of a gram. So if I want 12 grams in here, it's 11.9 to 12.1 is my kind of window. Once you grind them, weigh them again, because you might have lost a little bit of coffee to that grinder. In addition, before you grind your main tasting sample of a particular coffee, grind through just a little handful of beans just to make sure that there's nothing left from a previous coffee in that grinder. Once that's done, once you've weighed out all your beans, hide the bags; what you don't want is kind of prompts or taste notes lying around influencing you when you taste, so make a note of what's what, get rid of them. For the sake of this tasting, I'm just gonna set up three different coffees in three very different vessels; I'm going to need a couple of spare empty vessels that I'll use for rinsing and cleaning; and I'll be good to go. So right now, I'm gonna prep my three samples, and then I'm gonna boil a kettle, and when I come back, we'll start the tasting process. The sponsor of today's video is Skillshare.

Now, if you go to an industry tasting, you'll notice that people are often already taking notes on things like the smell of the dry grounds. There are going to be opportunities to smell the coffee before we taste it and that's interesting, but if you're new to coffee tasting: this isn't a test; if it's fun, that's good; if it's interesting, that's good; but you don't have to take copious notes, you don't have to find dozens of words to describe things; don't worry about it. Let's get into brewing. Now, I'm going to brew on scales because I'm brewing three different recipes here, I've got 12 grams, 15 and 20 (and I'll need to brew the right weights accordingly) and it's really hard to brew consistently without scales, even in the same bowls, with the same weight of coffee. Some coffees bloom more than others. So zero it out, add your hot water... Lovely. These are a little bit... hot. And this is now the perfect time to use the mostly useless digital assistant in your pocket, in your phone; set a timer for four minutes Okay, your timer is set for four minutes. At the end of four minutes, we're gonna get a spoon and we're gonna use it to stop the brewing process. We're gonna gently stir the crust on top three times, and that's gonna cause most of the grounds to sink to the bottom. You're then getting at a second spoon to scrape off anything on the top that's still floating, leaving a clean bowl ready to taste. Now again in the industry, you'll notice people smelling really intently when they're stirring that crust. It's an interesting aroma release moment. But if you're new to coffee tasting, don't worry about it too much. It's fun, and it's interesting, but don't obsess over these kind of details. The coffee industry has a bunch of other priorities around a tasting than we do at home. So now these are nearly ready to taste, they're just a little bit too hot. I would recommend waiting at least 10 more minutes to let them cool down. Right now, they're not only so hot that they'd burn your tongue, but they're almost impossible to taste when they're that hot. Tasting gets easier the cooler a coffee gets. Use this time to get rid of that rinse water, clean up the space, and get ready to cup. Go and grab that notebook, drink a glass of water, and get ready. And so now finally, it's time to taste. So, the spoon. The spoon is there so that we can just have a little sample of coffee and not have to pick up a mug of hot liquid. That's it. It lets us do one more thing, which is slurp the coffee. Now, you'll see coffee professionals make an astonishing array of bizarre noises as they slurp. This is mostly to cover our insecurities and make us look like we know what we're doing. Really, you need a little sample of liquid and just gently... You're really just trying to gently spray the coffee into your mouth. It's... just kind of turning up the volume on the flavors that you're tasting. Give your spoon a little rinse between bowls, and keep tasting. Compare and contrast; that's the game here. Make sure you keep tasting from hot, all the way down to kind of room temperature; the coffees are gonna change so much in that time and they'll just get easier and easier to taste. So like I said in a couple of weeks, there'll be another part of this which is much more focused on exploring your sense of taste through coffee. This is really just about the practical process of setting up and doing a coffee cupping at home, And what I want you to do is to go and try doing this. Set something up, give it a go. Taste, compare, contrast. Don't overthink it. Just think about what you'd like, what you don't like.", "videoID": "cSEgP4VNynQ"}, {"title": "The Fellow Ode 2\uff1a The Review", "text": "Today, we're talking about the Fellow Ode 2, the sequel to the Fellow Ode 1 grinder that came out in 2020, a grinder I was very excited for them to release, but a grinder that I had a few real issues with in my review. In this sequel, have they fixed those issues? Is this now a grinder that's gonna be easy for me to recommend at the end of this video? If you're not familiar with the Ode, it's a grinder from a company called Fellow. It's a filter-coffee-only, single-dose grinder. It's got 31 steps of adjustment going all the way from very coarse down to, well, not quite fine enough for espresso, but really, pretty fine. Now, in my first review, there were two big areas that I had concerns or problems with, one around grinding and one around, let's just say user experience. We're gonna address those two areas and talk about them a bit more in how they relate to this new version of the grinder. Let's start with how it grinds coffee. Now, the Fellow Ode 1, they chose a set of what they called interlocking burrs. They were an interesting design of burr set, but they did not allow you to grind fine enough for the kind of brewing that I like to do, which is, say, 15 grams of coffee from a light roast in, say, a V60. That needs a pretty fine grind, and the Ode 1 simply couldn't do it. The burrs couldn't get close enough because of their design, and as a result, for me, that was a kind of deal-breaker for the grinder. Now, alongside this grinder, which has changed too, they've been working on the Gen 2 burrs. I have a set of them here. These were supplied to me to go into my Ode 1 because I was a Kickstarter backer. That grinder currently has a set of SSP burrs in it. We'll talk about this stuff too. Don't you worry. These burrs, I think, are, frankly, very good. They're being sold separately for $80, and I think, as an $80 burr set, they offer great value for money. I used this grinder to do a lot of testing for the one-cup V60 video that I put out not too long ago, so I feel like I've got a really good idea of how this kind of brews coffee and the coffee that it produces, and I also talked to Lance Hedrick, who, alongside Nick from Fellow, did a lot of testing along with, I think, some other industry experts too, but Lance did a lot of testing, and I spoke to both Lance and Nick about what they were trying to achieve. They were aiming for a burr set that would give you great kind of texture and body with more developed roasts, but clarity and sweetness with lighter roasts, and I have to say I think Nick's burr design on this was excellent. I really enjoyed drinking the coffee that this burr set produced. I think it's very good coffee. Can you produce better coffee by spending more money? You can, but those returns are rapidly diminishing. I think if you were to drink the coffee from these burrs on its own, you'd really have a very good time. Yes, when you put them in comparison with a more expensive set or a more expensive grinder, you can taste the differences, but when I say those returns are diminishing, I really, really mean it. Quite early on, I thought it would be interesting to compare this to the SSP burrs, and in the cup, at matching extractions, they were surprisingly close. There was maybe a little bit more clarity in the SSP burrs, fractionally more sweetness maybe, but, you know, I was really searching for those differences, and it felt so close, actually, that I took samples of both grinders and had them run through a particle size analyzer. Now, before I show you the results of laser particle size analysis here's an important caveat: Anytime anyone shows you some data from one of these, you've gotta understand that this is not how these burrs perform generally. This is how these burrs performed on that day with that particular roast of that particular coffee at that particular grind setting. They're a really specific instance, but, I think, if you take the same extraction, and therefore, the same theoretical grind setting from two different burrs and compare them, that is interesting, and as you'll see as we show you the data, they were really pretty similar. Yes, the SSP produced less fines not a huge amount less fines, but you can see there is a difference there in the finer particles. Slightly more uniformity generally, but really pretty close. Those SSP burrs sell for $185 on Fellow's website, and I'm not sure that for most people in the world, those $105 are well spent. These $80 burrs perform, I think, really very well. It's clear that Nick and the team at Fellow put in a lot of time to get this whole thing right, and I think it was time well spent. Now, we need to talk about the UX kind of piece of it because frankly, the Ode 1 was messy and a little bit annoying. To highlight the changes they've made, I'm gonna brew some coffee, so the first change they've made is the hopper on top. It's a little bit taller, and that means you can get, say, 80 grams of coffee in here relatively easily. More important than the kind of capacity, for most people, is the fact that the angle of the hopper has changed. The Ode 1, I think, had about a 20-degree angle. This has gone up to a 27-degree angle, so you're less likely with the Ode 2, when you pour your beans in, to have a few beans left behind in the hopper that didn't fall all the way through into the burr set, something that is, frankly, very annoying. The second change is harder to show you here. We'll go into it in a little bit more detail in a second, but there is an ionizer at the exit chute of this grinder. They've redesigned the exit chute and massively improved it. The old grinder both had a lot of static issues as well as a lot of retention when you were grinding. This grinder still has some retention and some exchange wherein you might put 15 grams in and get 15 grams out, but not all of the 15 grams coming out is the same coffee that you put in. Some may be retained from the time before and pushed out, and new coffee then gets stuck and left inside. This makes way less mess, way less static. It is a massive quality of life improvement for me because the static on the first one really, really kind of wound me up. Did you hear that? Or did you not hear that? The first Ode had this really irritating beep when it finished grinding that I frankly did not understand. Firstly, it wasn't a good beep, and you need a good beep, and secondly, there's already an auditory cue that the grinder has finished grinding, as in, I can't hear it grinding anymore. You don't need to give me a secondary signal to say, \"I've stopped grinding.\" If you were trying to add a secondary signal, it would make sense to do something for people who maybe couldn't hear it grinding and give them a little light so they know that it's finished grinding. This doesn't beep, and that's great. That makes me happy. You didn't need to beep. It doesn't beep. (grinder knocker a-knocking) That's about the most annoying noise on this grinder, It's not a bad bag knocker. The dosing cup here that you can use to weigh your coffee beans in if you want to, and obviously, you would grind into, has been changed as well. It's a little bit larger to accommodate more coffee because the hopper can accommodate more coffee, but it's still got the little fins inside, and I've gotta tell you, I don't love the little fins. I feel like if they'd changed the angle of the fins here, made them a little steeper, a little sharper, they'd be less likely to sort of trap coffee behind them when you dose it out and do the job of funneling the coffee quite nicely, but this setup here, often, you need to kind of go back, shake a little bit, and pour a second time, and that just doesn't really delight me. Now, they did keep the magnet on the bottom of this and the magnet here so that you do have the fun little snap. I do have one more nitpick. I know I have reviewer brain, and I'm kind of broken in that way, but the way that this lid fits on this dosing cup really kind of bothers me. It just, it sits that fraction bit loose, always, and that, I don't like it. I don't like it. It makes you feel like I haven't seated it right, and I end up sort of faffing around and trying to reseat it. I think you can probably get away with just not using this, and that would be the answer. I'll be honest, if someone made a third-party dosing cup for this, I'd be interested if it was without fins and didn't do some of the annoying stuff that this does, and it just irks me, and I don't wanna be irked. It's done so much in terms of its evolution from the 1 to the 2 to remove points of frustration, but it's got this weird one that kind of wound me up. Let me brew this coffee. Nailing this recipe... Now, while this cools down so I can drink it, and I really do want to drink it, I wanna go back and talk a little bit more about the ionizer on this thing, which is, I think, a significant improvement. To give you an idea of how effective it is, what I'll do is I'll show you the Ode 1 and the Ode 2, both with no sort of spray of water onto the beans. It's called the Ross Droplet Technique , if you're not familiar with it, and it removes static in most grinders, so I'll give you with and without the spray on both grinders, side by side, shot in absurdly high frame rate so you can really kind of see the difference between all of them. I always spray as a kind of force of habit, and so I still spray with this, and I generally prefer to still spray with this grinder, but if I forget, I don't feel punished the same way that I did with the first generation of Ode grinder. Here they are in glorious slow motion. Now, I will say, if you're looking at my dial and thinking that's a bit finer than you might be using it, we are getting pretty high extractions with light roasted coffees around here, so 22 to 23% very comfortably with a V60 like this, and the cups have been just great. Tons of sweetness, plenty of clarity, nice body, and I don't wanna nitpick it against other burrs because most people never will. Does it make coffee you will enjoy most mornings? Yes, yes it does, and in terms of summary, does it still look good? It really does. I like the design of the Ode very much. I love its very small footprint. I think it's simple in all the right ways, and, in fact, one small improvement they've made, I feel like particularly useful to me, is that on the inside of this, they changed, very slightly, this chart to explain the numbers on here. I just couldn't read the first one. I just felt like I was just not bright enough to kind of cope with the information I was presented. This I find much more readable and understandable, and so I'm grateful to Fellow for that one 'cause I messed it up the first time. Always embarrassing when it's on YouTube forever, so it feels like this is an easy recommendation from me, and it nearly is. You know, the little gripes that I have with it, the little complaints are really relatively small. The last thing that we haven't talked about is price. Now, this isn't out in the UK yet. In fact, this is a 110 U.S. model. The 240 volt or the 230 volt, or whatever the proper voltage is gonna be, that's coming a little bit later, and so we don't have the pricing for that yet, but in the U.S., this is $345, which, I don't know how I feel about that. The first grinder, I think, was 299 or 295. It was a $300 grinder, but the left digit, perhaps the most important digit, was a 2, and they've made it a 3 here. Now, I'm not sure it feels like it should be a more expensive grinder because, yes, they've spent money on a new burr set and all that kind of stuff, but at the same time, they've built a lot of these. Component costs should be coming down. They talk about how the new Opus grinder, their new espresso and filter conical burr grinder, has a more powerful motor in there, so the cost of this, I'm not really sure where it is. Now, this is just pure speculation on my part, but I feel like the price is the price in part because they still have stock of the Ode 1 that they need to sell, and I think if that grinder was put up against this grinder, and this one was under $300, people would just choose this every single time, and people wouldn't buy the cheaper Ode at the price that they're trying to sell it at, so by having it that little bit higher, I think it creates a nice differential in price that encourages sales of the Ode sort of number 1, but for people who really care about all the things that the Ode 2 does,  yes, I think it's good value for money. I think there are grinders coming that will challenge its space in terms of being small footprint, really good for filter coffee, not capable of espresso, but well-made, well-built, enjoyable to use, great cup quality. Right now, a lot of people are like, \"What grinder should I get for filter? \"I don't wanna do espresso at home.\" This feels much easier to recommend as long as they have the budget, and 345 does feel like quite a lot of money. If this was at 295, I just feel like be so easy to recommend it, so that's my opinion of the Ode 2 with the Gen 2 burrs. I have to say I'm pleased with the changes that have been made. I think it is a good grinder. I enjoy the coffee that comes out of it very much. Mm. Ah. Oh, that's very nice. That is nice. Derailing myself immediately. I'm trying to wrap up here. Now, this particular grinder is gonna go to one of my Patreon supporters. They support me in being able to buy this equipment at full price, like a normal consumer, and then test it and give you my honest opinion and not be reliant on reviewing it or freebies or any of that stuff, so thank you so much to them for the support in doing this, but now I wanna hear from you down in the comments below.", "videoID": "3f8dv72Ex6U"}, {"title": "The Tiramisu\uff1a How It Became So Popular (Ep #1)", "text": "Today we're talking about one of the classics of coffee. We're talking about the tiramisu. It is an incredible Italian dessert recipe. It is, I think, the best way to eat your coffee. And to uncover its history and the story behind it, I've come here to this city, just north of Venice called Treviso, 'cause this is where the tiramisu was born. And not only do I want to talk to people who know about that, I want to eat in the restaurant that still serves what is the quintessential, kind of, original tiramisu. That restaurant is called Le Beccherie, and it opened in 1939, and it's located just off the main square in the heart of the city. But before dinner there tonight, there are a few questions to answer. The story of the tiramisu should be simple. This recipe, as we know it, is less than 50 years old, and that kind of blows my mind. But in this story, there are, I think, unsung heroes. There's controversy over who really did create the tiramisu as we know it today. More than that, I think about this recipe, I think about how did we convince everyone this was such a good idea? Who said at the end of your meal what you need is some coffee, raw egg yolks, cheese, biscuits, and a little cocoa powder? Then, everything will be fine. But somehow it worked. And somehow this recipe spread virally all over the world. And I kind of want to know, how did the tiramisu get just so popular?   Now, if you go and dig into any recipe, any inception of a dish, you're never gonna find like a clean, neat moment of inspiration where suddenly it appears. But I do want to dig into this recipe that does appear at Le Beccherie because this is the one that becomes notarized by the Italian Academy of Cuisine. This is the one that kind of becomes official. So the timeframe we wanna explore is the 1960s. Back then, Le Beccherie is a restaurant owned and operated by Ado and Alba Campeol Now this version of the recipe appears in the restaurant, but I really feel it begins in their home in the kitchen. Now, we can't talk to Ado and Alba, sadly, they passed away last year. But we did sit down with Carlo, their son, so we could hear his story of the beginning of the recipe. There's another person in this story that we need to talk about, the pastry chef at Le Beccherie, Roberto Linguanotto known as Loli. Now, we spoke to Loli's son, Massimo, to get more of his side of the story. There is one other story we should talk about, the idea that the tiramisu began in the brothels of Treviso. It existed there, was created there, as a kind of aphrodisiac 'pick me up' for the patrons of those places. I wanted to know if there was any truth whatsoever in that story. - So it is probable that there was a dessert called tiramisu around the brothels of Treviso at that time, made from similar ingredients,  popular in the region. But it was probably not the same dessert that we know as tiramisu today. So I feel like we know more about the history of tiramisu than we might for almost any other dish, in an interesting kind of way. I feel like we can see that it pre-exists Le Beccherie but that moment of definition that happens at Le Beccherie is really interesting and it kind of codifies or defines what the tiramisu is now to most people around the world. And talking to everyone and other people too, it feels like tiramisu is powered by nostalgia for many people. Like it is the taste of the home to them. And so when they travel, tiramisu reminds them of home. And then there's the other kind of travel I think that also played a big role from the 1980s onwards, especially in the 1990s. Tourism opens up, food tourism in particular, it's cheaper to travel around Europe and people come for a taste of Italy and they take that away with them. And now I'm excited to taste something because later tonight, I'm gonna go to Le Beccherie. I'm gonna eat that tiramisu, and I think I'm gonna enjoy it immensely. I'm gonna inevitably load it with a lot of expectation. That's kind of scary. Seems a little unfair, almost. But I think it's gonna be just a really interesting point of definition, but also a kind of moment in the overall evolution of tiramisu because it feels like it is something that does change and evolve. I'm excited. That is good. Let me just get one more. Everything is perfectly balanced. The coffee is there, the mascarpone is there, the chocolate is just nice. The lady fingers soaked in coffee have a really nice texture where there's just a little bit of bite. They don't feel like wet and soggy. They've got a little bit of resistance. They're very good. This particular tiramisu, like all great ones is so much more than the sum of its parts. In fact this one perhaps even more so  with its added layer of history and significance I've been thinking a lot about that tiramisu from last night. I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the opportunity to taste a little piece of history in the place that it was born. That feels special. I also don't feel the need to tear it to pieces. You know, this is a recipe where I feel a kind of weird permission to mess with it and make it mine, to kind of chase my ultimate tiramisu. I feel like that's what tiramisu is to so many families here. It's their version of that thing. And I wanna make my version of that thing. I am looking forward to it. I think we're gonna do like a series of videos where we can explore things like recipe, technique, ingredients, all of that kind of stuff is to come. And actually, I want to hear from you down in the comments below. What do you wanna see me look at in this journey to my ultimate tiramisu? Let me know.", "videoID": "oWMbuTc7iIU"}, {"title": "How Coffee Brewing Makes Better Vegetable Stock", "text": "Coffee might finally have broken my brain. You're looking at this, you can see I have coffee but you can see a lot of vegetables, you're wondering what is going on here. You've clicked the title. You know that something is going on with vegetable stock and coffee. Let me explain. Now, stick with me. I guarantee there's a payoff coming if you have any interest whatsoever in food cooking and cooking science. So, I was watching a video on making stock. That happens. I'm a normal person. I don't think that's weird but I was watching them prep the stock and they were putting big chunks of vegetable in. Do you know what it made me think of?  Someone making a V60 with just whole coffee beans. It seemed to me that having a very large piece of vegetable wasn't a very efficient way to make stock but I looked at some more videos and more videos and everyone seems to put these big hunks of vegetable into their vegetable stock. This doesn't make sense. We know from the world of coffee that the finer you grind your coffee, the more surface area you expose, the more extraction of flavour you can do. Right? That's key. Now in coffee, there's some flavour we don't want, right? But I would argue for the most part in a carrot, we want as much as possible. A carrot is delicious. If I eat a carrot, I think that's delicious. If I eat a coffee bean, I don't think that's delicious. Right? You can taste some of the stuff that maybe you don't want to extract when you are brewing coffee. So here's what I'm thinking. Instead of just chopping big, ugly pieces of vegetable. What if we went finer and finer and finer? What if we went to an extreme? What if we juiced the vegetables? Surely that's gonna be the most effective way of extracting flavour from them, right? Now, you might think I'm a coffee person. This is a coffee channel. What credentials do I have to be talking about vegetable stock? I thought about that and so I roped in someone much, much smarter than me. I called up my friend, Chris Young. Now, I've known Chris for years and years and years. I met him when he was running the lab at The Fat Duck, Heston Blumenthal's restaurant, as it came up into the kind of three Michelin stars, global fame era. He then went and co-authored a book called \"Modernist Cuisine\" which is really the bible of modern food science and cookery. He then went to cofound ChefSteps and he's now starting another new project. He also has a YouTube channel. You should check it out. Now, I called Chris up and almost instantly, he started dropping huge amounts of knowledge. - So, the juicing thing is really interesting and this goes back to 'where do flavours come from?' and this is more true for, I mean, this is, what we don't realize is a lot of the flavours we identify with meats, seafoods, and especially plant foods, they don't intrinsically exist in the raw unadulterated piece of meat. We all kind of understand that you have to roast a piece of meat to get the Maillard roasty flavours. - Right. - That's kind of obvious, right? But what we don't realize is a cucumber, for example, or a tomato for that matter, doesn't have much cucumber flavour or tomato flavour until you break the cells and then a bunch of enzymes start to break down stuff that's in the pulp and turn it into the aroma, and this is kind of your problem with juicing versus cooking. As soon as you juice it, you're gonna get a lot of flavours that otherwise wouldn't be present in the stock because I put a big chunk in, I bring it up to a boil, and the enzymes are destroyed before the cells really rupture and they can create a lot of flavour. It's not to say that your instinct of shrink the surface area, use less of the stuff is invalid. It totally works but to the extent you're trying to adapt one stock recipe to this, you're likely to end up not very successful. I think to the extent you choose a bunch of components that go into stock and you blend them in different ways and taste and act like a winemaker trying to blend barrels and different varietals to come up with something that's good. I think you could get to something that could be really great. I personally think it will be pretty different and you'll realize that this is kind of a vegetable stock, not like any other vegetable stock on the market and in fact, it's delicious, but you kind of have to think of it with a different context than 'I'm trying to just come up with a cheaper way to make vegetable stock that's more frugal and less wasteful'. - Okay, so it's time to make some stock. I'm gonna make two stocks here. I'm gonna make a traditional version and then I'm gonna make a juiced version to compare it to. Now, obviously Chris made me think that that juiced version should be kind of inferior even though it's technically more efficient, but we'll find out. Now, I need a baseline recipe, right? I need someone's recipe that I think is emblematic of how the professional world has talked about stocks to the consumers and kitchens and there's really no one better, I think, than Gordon Ramsay. He's a cheffy chef but he's also big into the cooking at home so he should know how to make a good vegetable stock, right? This recipe is gonna make me angry and I'll explain why. Three onions, peeled and roughly chopped. One leek, washed and roughly chopped. Two celery stalks, roughly chopped. Six carrots, peeled and roughly chopped. One head of garlic, halved crosswise. Teaspoon of white peppercorns. A bay leaf. A few thyme, basil, tarragon, coriander, and parsley sprigs, tied together. 200 mls of dry white wine, and salt and pepper. Sensible enough but everything is roughly chopped. It's gonna be big pieces of vegetable and I can't imagine we're gonna get the most out of them. Now, this is me just getting a bit angry, but seriously, how can you just say six carrots? Gordon, how big is a carrot, right? Is a carrot this big? Is it this big? Is a carrot this big? Because if I get six different carrots, my amount of carrots, my mass of carrots is all over the place. Now, people say I get a bit extreme for using grams for everything, but how else am I supposed to have an accurate and an easily replicable recipe? Just give me the grams. Give me the grams, Gordon. So, the technique is pretty simple. Once everything's peeled and chopped, it goes into the pan with two liters of water. We're gonna bring it to the boil, simmer it for 20 minutes only. We're gonna take the pan off the heat, throw in the herbs, throw in the wine, throw in a little seasoning, and then we're gonna give it a stir, and allow it to cool completely. Right, at that point, we're gonna say it's done. I'm gonna decant it out and we'll then make the juiced stock afterwards. So stock one, the traditional stock is cooling down. It's time for version two, the juiced version. In the first round, doing Gordon's job for him, I weighed everything that I put in that stock and I'm using exactly the same mass of each thing here. There's only really one difference. If I juice a whole head of garlic, then I'll get a ton of those enzymatic reactions that create those kind of very harsh garlicky flavours of raw garlic. I don't want those there. Here, I've just poached, kind of confited a head of garlic to get rid of that, to deactivate those enzymes, so that when I do juice it, it won't have that same aggressive pungency. A lesson learned from Chris from our conversation. But let's get on with it now. Everything is here, ready to go. I'm gonna juice the herbs. It might go horribly wrong. I don't know if it's gonna work well but I'm gonna throw everything kind of in together to what we get, really interesting. Obviously, this is like incredibly finely diced carrot without that much carrot flavour, which bodes well 'cause hopefully most of the carrot flavour is down in the liquid below. Now, to keep this consistent, I'll have to add this to two liters of water, bring it to the boil and cook it and simmer it for 20 minutes, and I know 20 minutes is a pretty short stock cooking time, certainly for professional kitchens, but that's what Gordon said. That's what we're gonna do. So we have our two stocks done. We have here, our original stock, Gordon's recipe, and then we have the juiced stock here. Now, my coffee brain is sort of upset that this one looks kind of watery in comparison to this one, right? Because usually with coffee, the more you extract, the darker the coffee looks, right? We don't know what that means for flavour, right? Colour and flavour aren't necessarily intertwined when it comes to stock. Stock number one Plenty of clarity of flavour. Let's try our clearer looking stock, which makes me nervous it won't have the strength of flavour. Shouldn't have worried about that. That just keeps going. Okay, that is a lot. That is a lot more intense. It's just packed full of flavour, almost overwhelming. It's not as kind of wonky as I would have thought, right? It's not like suddenly it's all leeks or it's all carrots. It's still actually pretty balanced. It's just a lot more intense. Now, there are I think some pretty interesting implications from this and I think there is a path forwards. We'll talk about that after a short ad from this video's sponsor which is Skillshare. Now, Skillshare is an online learning community, full of thousands of classes for creative and curious people, just like you and me. I use Skillshare to feed my curiosity about loads of different aspects of my life and my hobbies.

So, really there's no question that this stock has a lot more flavour. And, kind of out of interest, I kept some of the vegetables that you would usually discard at the end of stock making before it would typically go in the compost or food waste or whatever and I was kind of curious, how would a carrot taste? Is it gonna be an empty lifeless husk or is it gonna taste good? Is it gonna taste like a carrot just cooked in a bit of stock? That's basically delicious, Plenty of carrot flavour left, some nice stock flavour in there too. It seems completely wild to me that in the process of stock making, you'd be happy discarding the vegetables in this state. I don't wanna say that this version is better but it is unquestionably more efficient, and food is not limitless in supply. It costs money. It takes up resources to produce it, to get it to our homes. If we're throwing it away in good condition, if we're throwing away flavour, that just doesn't make sense to me, right? The whole process of stock making is about extraction of flavour to use somewhere else. We're not doing an efficient job with traditional recipes. So how do we take this forwards into our kitchens, into our homes? What's the practical outcome of this slightly bizarre experiment? One, if you make stocks regularly and you own a juicer, you have to try this. I would say as a starting point, half the amount of vegetables that you would typically use for an amount of stock. Secondly, if you're making some sort of meat-based stock, I see no reason that the thinking should not apply there. If you are putting large chunks of meat into a stock, I think that's being grotesquely wasteful. I think it might be an inconvenience but you're gonna get a lot more flavour by exposing maximum surface area. Be it beef, chicken, whatever you're doing, I think the technique totally applies. Three, this is really Chris's point. Stock recipes to date have come through hundreds of years, hundreds of thousands, if not, millions of kitchens, it's been well iterated upon and our ratios of carrot to leek to celery to onion, they're pretty well-understood. And yeah, I think there may need to be a change and a kind of tweaking of that and the more people that test this, and share their experience, the faster that iteration will go. I'm gonna leave a link to a Google Form down below. If you try this, if you mess around with it, I would love to hear from you. What were your ratios? Just give me like carrots as your 100% ratio, and then scale it up or down from there. For every hundred grams of carrots, how many grams of leeks, how many grams of onions did you use? And share that with me and hopefully enough people do it that we kind of get a wisdom of the crowds moment, where we get a kind of giant opinion on what works really well and I will share that after a month or two of data collection. Fourth and lastly, I think the world is full of opportunities for cross-pollination of thinking, thinking about this through the lens of coffee was kind of interesting and took me on an interesting journey.", "videoID": "VV68NiRulEk"}, {"title": "A Better 1 Cup V60 Technique", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about a better one cup V60 technique. Now, a few years ago actually I released a video on the V60 technique that I did a load of testing on and I was really happy with the results, but I did get one consistent piece of criticism. It was a difficult technique to get great results from with a smaller amount of coffee, and I think that was probably justified criticism. So, we acquired a few different V60s and we did a lot of testing. We went back to the drawing board and we have ended up I think with a really fun really easy technique that gets really delicious results. Here's how the video's gonna work. I'm gonna walk you through the technique as I brew some coffee and highlight the key steps involved. Then I'll talk through some of the decisions and testing that we did in terms of why we recommending that you do it the way we recommend you to do it. So let's get into it. Now, this technique actually has quite a lot of crossover with the original technique. We're still gonna use 60 grams of coffee per liter, but because we're brewing one cup, today, we're just gonna have 15 grams of coffee beans to 250 grams of water. Here I've got my 15 grams of coffee. It's a relatively light roast. We will touch on techniques or adjustments for darker roast levels a little bit later on. Now, because we're brewing 250 grams, right now it's a pretty good idea to carve that up into 20% blocks. By that I mean 50 gram blocks. How we brew is gonna be in essentially five blocks of 50 grams, and that's the easiest way to think about it. If you were brewing 18 to 300, those would be 60 gram blocks. If you were brewing, just say 12 grams that would be a 40 gram block. The maths we're gonna keep relatively simple today. The other consistencies with the technique is you definitely want soft, filtered, clean tasting water involved there. We're gonna be boiling it to 100 degrees Celsius and using it fresh from the boil. In addition, we are gonna be using scales to brew, because those are just the easiest way to kind of track what you're doing without really having to think about it too much. So, I'll ground some coffee and I'll show you the ground setting. It's probably finer than most people expect, but it's not super fine. But certainly when I see a lot of people struggling with the technique, I think that they're using a slightly too coarse of ground of coffee. So, I'll show you the grounds now. That's definitely finer than most people would typically use for a V60, but I think with lighter roasted coffees especially, you do wanna be this fine to get all of the goodness out of them. You could go coarser for darker roasts, but here, for this coffee, this has been tasting pretty great. As for the brewer itself, I would recommend the plastic one cup V60. One, it's the cheapest and that's really important. And two, it takes the least amount of work to get it hot to the point that it won't drop the temperature. We did quite a lot of temperature testing and this is adequately preheated by sort of a kitchen sink hot tap. If that runs hot enough to be slightly uncomfortable to touch, I dislike the idea of using boiling water to preheat this thing. It just feels like a waste of energy and a waste of water. So, a very hot kitchen tap, rinse the paper, get the brewer hot and that way you'll have a better tasting brew. And it's primarily actually the bloom where the temperature is impacted. Most of the brew in the plastic one anyway, ends up at the same temperature, because plastic's better for thermal retention. One rinsed brewer, one preheated brewer. We're gonna put our coffee in and just dig a little mound in the middle, like a kind of a volcano almost. Turn on and zero your scale and then boil your kettle. So as soon as your kettles boiled, start your timer and bloom with up to about 50 grams of water. Might be a little less, that's okay. That feels like it's good and give it a gentle swirl. The point here is not to kind of get the grounds right up the walls of the V60, it's just to do a good job mixing together the grounds and the water to make sure all the coffee is starting to brew at the same time. We're gonna bloom, leave it like this for 45 seconds before we pour our next block of water to take us up to 100 grams at about one minute. This is easiest with a pouring kettle, but a pouring kettle is not essential. We've tested this extensively with other kettles too. Keep the spout relatively low. It's quite a slow pour. In circles. And then what we're gonna do is pulse. So at 110 we're gonna add another 50 grams of water and that should take us about 10 seconds. Pouring in circles as you go. Don't obsess over every second over every gram. We're looking for approximately that amount in approximately that time. Another 10 seconds of waiting and then another 10 seconds of pouring to take us to 200 grams. Keep moving in circles. And then, that last dose to take us up to 250 at two minutes. At that point, give the brewer just a gentle swirl. You should have plenty of space at the top to be able to do that. It shouldn't be full to the brim. If it is your grind maybe too fine. And then let it draw down. Let it drain out. Now, we tested this with a few different papers. We tended to see brew times of around three minutes, but your mileage may vary. If you've swirled too aggressively, you might have clogged the filter paper that will slow down the draw down. Your grinder may produce more fines, that'll slow it down too. You still kind of have to go by taste a little bit in terms of nailing that ground size, but with most good grinders, I think a three minute brew time is pretty normal in most circumstances. Again, the point here is not to obsess over nailing the exact numbers. We found this to be really a pretty tolerant recipe and as we get to three minutes, the bed is dry. We have brewed a delicious cup of coffee. So the question that you'll probably have is why was I doing the pulsing the way that I was doing it? And we did a huge amount of testing on this to try and understand what worked well. Now, depending on how quickly you pour and from what height you pour, you'll vary the way that you agitate the bed of coffee with that stream coming in. What we generally found worked best was always to use a circular pour throughout. Regardless of anything else. It helped distribute the water across the coffee and it helped distribute the agitation across the coffee. You'll see a number of techniques that recommend a center pour. We didn't have great results with that unless we were pouring from higher up to the point that the stream as it fell was broken. Now a while ago, we did a video on pouring kettles and as part of that we discovered something kind of interesting. The higher you pour from then the less agitation you actually create in the coffee. It seems like as the stream begins to break as that hits the bed of water, that energy is dissipated. Whereas if it's a continuous stream that stream fell into the coffee and sort of agitated it much more effectively. Our recommendation here is that you keep the spout relatively close to the bed of coffee and your pour speed should agitate it just about enough, which is why we recommend pouring at about five grams a second. Some scales will actually give you that information if you want it. That seemed to do a really nice job in terms of agitation, but not generating channels. Because we were pulsing, it means we could have a sort of moment of agitation. The bed would settle again, a moment of agitation, the bed would settle again and we didn't have issues with uneven extractions, but we did get to have a nice amount of agitation to increase the extraction to get a sweeter, fuller, more delicious cup. What we saw is with a center pour, if you pour just in the middle and you don't swirl at the end then you kind of see what you did to the bed and a center pour just created a kind of massive crater in the middle of the bed and led for an uneven taste, whereas the pour from higher up actually didn't do that. It just didn't taste as good, because it hadn't done as much agitation. It's all a lot I know. But the ultimate recommendation or the ultimate best practice from our testing was, these little pulse pours of 50 grams every 10 seconds giving that really nice mixture of even distribution and even agitation that was controlled and actually pretty repeatable regardless of the kettle that you were using. And actually in terms of brew temperatures for darker roasts that would be down at 80 through to 85 going up to sort of maybe 90. Medium roasts then 90 through 95. But light roasts, you wanna be at boiling point. Coming back to these brewers again, the difference in thermal stability and then sort of need for preheating between the plastic and the others is really massive. Both the ceramic and the glass really needed a lot of preheating and you have to do that with boiling water which I find a little bit wasteful and frustrating. But they are nice objects to own and if they are preheated they do brew kind of normally they're kinda the same as everything else. But one interesting fact that sort of blew my mind is we brewed a non preheat and a preheat side by side and the end extraction was identical, right? We can't detect a measurable increase in extraction from preheating. The taste night and day. And this is a classic example of measurable extraction does not always correlate with the best tasting cup of coffee. And this was so interesting for us the taste that, that drop particularly in the bloom of temperature really left the cup feeling less sweet, more acidic and just less enjoyable overall. So, preheating I think is really important with lighter roast using freshly boiled water straight off the boil I think, is really important. We found that once you were kind of in the ballpark of the technique, the coffee tasted pretty good. And if the coffee were to taste really bad the first thing I would look at wouldn't be necessarily the technique. I would be more concerned about grind size or grind quality. I would be more concerned about water and I would potentially be then concerned about the coffee itself. There are a lot of different V60 techniques out there and they pretty much mostly all work. This for me felt repeatable, easy. I could teach someone to do it very quickly, but there are other techniques you should definitely play with and explore. But I'd love to hear how you get on with this one. But don't obsess over the technique. You're gonna get good results if you have good water, freshly ground good quality coffee, ground at the right setting. But now I wanna hear from you down in the comments below, which aspect of this technique do you want more explanation of? Do let me know if you try it and let me know how your results go. Do make sure you dial in that grind though.", "videoID": "1oB1oDrDkHM"}, {"title": "The \u00a3299 Aldi Espresso Machine - How Bad Could It Be\uff1f", "text": "A little bit of an unusual one today, if I'm honest. This is not the sort of thing I'd typically review here on the channel, but I couldn't sorta pass it up it was to ridiculous. Now this is a coffee machine from Aldi, a supermarket group you may be familiar with, a place that's really cheap but people tend to be like \"Oh but the wines really good.\" I don't shop at Aldi, not out of any real snobbery or anything, I just don't have one near me, so, you know I'm not dissing you Aldi, I'm just, I'm just, I'm just not, you know, a customer, but people are and people like it and I shouldn't joke about the whole wine obsession people have with it. It's getting off topic. Aldi do cheap stuff, that people say is surprisingly good, and so when Aldi dropped this, well I had to have a look, it's a \u00a3299 coffee machine, it's a kind of super automatic in a way, it's got a built in grinder, but it is portafilter based, comparable I guess to machines like the Sage Barista Express, which is twice the price, and De'Longhi's very Sage like La Specialista, that's again the same sort of price, though that one has a pressurized portafilter, so I kind of put that off to the side. This has a regular portafilter, with proper holes and everything, in fact it's got quite a fancy portafilter. Not only is it really quite a nice little handle on this thing here, but they've even got like a little rubberized flat bit on the bottom, for your tamping, how thoughtful, how considerate, how surprising for \u00a3299, though it doesn't come with a dose recommendation, just the little max line on the side, we'll get into brewing coffee with this in a second. I've just turned it on, I've got it hot, I have yet to make a coffee with it. Now it's got a little steam wand, the steam settings on the side here imply that it's one thermoblock heating everything cause you've gotta put the machine into preheat mode, which I presume heats that main thermoblock up super hot and then you can get steam out of it, you'd then probably have to cool it down afterwards to get the coffee out of it again, that's not unusual in a cheaper machine, but a grinder in a cheaper machine is definitely a surprising thing. It is pretty bad design, it looks like it's okay, but you know, stuff like the badly stuck on badge here that's just not quite level, or the fact that the drip tray appears to be designed to be whatever space is left, and therefore not really enough space to put like three cups on top, it's just a little car crash up here so far, but hey it's early, let's not judge to much, let's put some coffee in it. Now this isn't just like a hey look, here's a weird cheap thing that's surprisingly cheap, but the question is, is it good value for money? You know just cause it's cheap it might be terrible value for money is it just can't make anything resembling vaguely good espresso, but if it can make good espresso, that will be astonishing wouldn't it? Though it feels unlikely at this point, I mean unwrapping this thing, it was not your nice like peel off the nice plastic from the stainless steel, it was more like just like wrapped a couple times in cling film, in a slightly sloppy forgetful way, that doesn't, you know, inspire confidence when you're opening a coffee machine up. Doesn't do a particularly good job of protecting it either it would seem from the scratches on the side. We're getting off the point. So, let's make some coffee with this, I think. Whoops. We've got a good amount of coffee in here. I'm not quite at my max fill line, and I'm at 17 and a half grams of coffee, and this has just been a bit of a mess so far, but we're gonna be okay. I believe in us. Now this is a programmed dose, as I understand it, so I'm just gonna, push my two cup button, and we'll hope for the best. See what happens, with this. Pre-infusion. Looking like a pretty fast shot, don't think anyone's surprised that this is a faster shot. Yeah that's a, that's a pretty generous portion. I don't think we're gonna let the volumetrics control it next time I think we may put the scale underneath, because out 17 grams yielded, 74 grams of liquid, bit more than we wanted in a sorta one to two, one to two and a half ratio here so, so we're not drinking that one. So we'll go two steps finer, and then we'll give it a go again, I'll dose maybe 18 grams, and I'll aim for like 36 to 40 out, I think you know less than 36 would be deeply unwise, and we'll see how long that takes. Kinda gotta try and tease the, oh! Okay we're at 16.3, we need some more coffee, I just don't know if we can get past these little pincers, without, damaging things. I hate you so much right now. we're not gonna be friends, we're just not gonna be friends. When you lock the portafilter in, let me just try and explain this, this, this portafilter gets incredibly close to the grinding mechanism, that you couldn't put your hand in there, that's just stupid. Okay, we're gonna be okay though, all gonna be okay, that's gonna be fine, everything's gonna be okay. Let's brew. Pre-infusion. We're not getting much yet, it's 23 seconds into the shot, Oh there it is, like, like nectar, or just like a really slow espresso that's gonna taste awful. A little hissing, something's not happy. Well then, what just happened there, well I suspect a number of terrible things happened at once to yield what we just saw. Now firstly the gauge here got up to what it said was like 16 bars, which is a lot of pressure, to much pressure, at those kind of pressures you compress the cake so much that you compound the problem, like you make harder to get through which in this case makes this machine pump water harder, it's a very stupid cycle to get into, you don't want a machine running at really high pressure where you just get your ideal pressure by varying the resistance, that's just not a good way to work, because of the issues with puck compression, and then what you saw at the end, with that steamy release was I guess the water spent to long in contact with the thermoblock because it was flowing to slowly, these things are not particularly accurate, they're designed to heat water at a kinda fixed flow rate, we were obviously much slower than that flow rate, so it got heated more than it should have been. So all in all everything went wrong, with that shot, I will go back a little bit coarser, cause I went to far and I go back one coarser, and I'll just make sure my dose, is like, 17.5 as much as I can with this god awful grinder, and then we'll see if we can pour like a decent shot, cause I think, I think together we can achieve anything. Anyone who's able to withdraw the portafilter without spilling coffee, is a Jedi Master of sorts. Why are we still at 16 bars, I mean why, why do you hate me? Alright we're gonna go, we're gonna go apparently much coarser, we're gonna go much coarser because nothing makes sense and I hate everything about this grinder this is not a good experience so far. okay, what will happen now? What will happen, now? Oh, pumps gone a little high. This espresso looks terrible. That's still a 34, 35 second shot, to hit our ratio. Can't tell you how much I don't want to drink this. I mean the coffee in was nice. This is a stupid coffee machine, I hate this coffee machine, it's a stupid coffee machine. Look, at this point, the grind is definitely to coarse, you need to grind finer, but because this things pump pressure is determined by resistance, you can't get good espresso out of it, can't be done, because once you produce adequate resistance, this thing will spike massive pressures at the pump, compress the cake and choke your shot, you won't be able to get a normal flow rate from your very fine, properly ground, espresso ground, coffee. It's the stupidest coffee machine we've seen on this channel by a long way, I hate it, I really hate it. I feel like, you know, picking up the portafilter, gave me this moment of like, maybe this won't completely suck, but it completely sucks, all of the good ideas belong entirely in the portafilter with it's nice rubber bit for tamping. The tamper the that comes with it, is of course plasticky nonsense, but it's a \u00a3299 coffee machine, I'm not so weird as to presume that it would be actually good or useful. The water tank seems nice, it's got a nice lid, that's you know, good, but it can't make good coffee and having a cup tray, where if you put cups on top, make it really noisy, is also stupid, it's just sloppily designed. Buy something better, if you want something like this, get the Sage, don't buy this, this is \u00a3299 for a reason, and it's an absolute waste of money, it's terrible value, it is for what you get, far to expensive. You would be happier with like a mocha pot and, and like a whisk and some, some I don't know. The steaming on this, comes with a little clacky, twisty dial thing, which is weird, there's a little light flashing, so indeed the thermoblock is, is heating up. There's our, steamy release, it's to hot to make coffee, so it's cooling the system, it's kinda nice that it does it automatically, probably looks pretty dramatic. It seems to have adequate pressure for steam, it's a single holed tip which I don't love, but I'm sure it could steam adequate milk, unspectacular probably, but, I mean, you know, to pour into what garbage tasting, disgusting espresso that this thing will produce. Ambiano, why do they even call, I mean why not stick Aldi on the front, why don't they just give in, be honest about it.", "videoID": "tuFQbiIVUkw"}, {"title": "Tasting The Lost Species That Might Save Coffee", "text": "You're familiar with the coffee species arabica, then you're likely familiar with Coffea canephora, known commonly as robusta. There are over 120 known species of coffee, many of them discovered and described by Dr. Aaron Davis of Kew Gardens. These wild species are indigenous to countries across the world, and in a few cases, cultivated and consumed, but most are not viable when it comes to being a global crop species that we might cultivate to ultimately drink and enjoy each morning. There is one species of coffee that I've always been fascinated by. It's called Coffea stenophylla. While many species were never grown and consumed as coffee, this one was. Historically, it grew in West Africa, and can be traced back to 1794 in Sierra Leone. It was named in 1834 and characterized as having narrow leaves, which gives the species its name. Its production was centered in Sierra Leone, but it was also grown in Guinea, Ghana, Senegal, Ivory Coast, and even briefly in Uganda. Although it could grow at low altitudes and despite reports of having excellent taste properties, it fell out of favor due to its poor yield, compared to that of robusta. From the 1940s onwards, production declined, and by the 1980s, it had pretty much vanished. It was one of the descriptions of its taste that stuck with me from the moment I read it. William H. Ukers's book, \"All About Coffee,\" first published in 1922, is considered by some to be the seminal and definitive coffee writing of its time. In it, he briefly describes the species stenophylla. \"Coffea arabica has a formidable rival in the species stenophylla. The flavor of this variety is pronounced by some as surpassing that of arabica.\" The line stuck with me and the desire to taste stenophylla was lodged into my brain, though, due to the disappearance of the species, I quickly came to accept it would be one I would never achieve. In 2020, Dr. Aaron Davis was the lead author of a paper describing the work done to try and find stenophylla again in the wild. Aaron had a jar of stenophylla beans on his desk that had been collected in 1873 and submitted to Kew, making this something of a passion project for him. The combination of field work in Sierra Leone and genetic analysis was used to hunt it down. What many producers had thought was stenophylla turned out to be robusta. But they did manage to find two samples of stenophylla growing in the wild. Now, Dr. Davis is publishing a followup paper written as a collaboration between Kew, Greenwich University, CIRAD, and their partners in Sierra Leone. And this has just been published in Nature. We traveled down to Kew Gardens to speak with him about his latest findings and the potentially huge implications it has with the coffee industry. It, it really was a sort of hair standing up on the back of your neck moment because immediately it's, it was showing those qualities that you, that you require in, in high quality coffee. I've tasted quite a few wild coffees, probably about 20, and generally they're very disappointing. When we actually cut it and we tasted it, the most surprising thing was that tasted like arabica. And not only did it taste like arabica, it tasted like a Rwandan arabica, a bourbon of, of high elevation, like a high-quality coffee. We're, we're in the Palm House here at Kew, and you can probably tell it's pretty hot. It's 30 degrees in here and that is the sort of environment you would expect of stenophylla. Now, that's quite different, what you'd find in most high-quality arabica-growing areas, like Ethiopia, where instead of, of a hot tropical environment like this, we're looking at a cool tropical environment. According to latest IPCC report, it's unlikely we're gonna keep global warming under two degrees C. Even if we get another one degree increase, that is gonna be devastating to the coffee sector. This was the exciting thing here, we had a plant that tasted like arabica but is able to grow and produce a crop under much warmer conditions. When we were doing our tasting at, at Union Hand-Roasted Coffee in East London, what we didn't realize, the French research group CIRAD were doing the same with a sample that they were growing in Reunion, one of the Mascarene Islands. As part of the paper, what we did was to do a climate analysis comparing robusta, liberica, arabica, and stenophylla, and what we found was stenophylla were growing at temperatures six degrees, or even actually up to 6.8 degrees warmer than arabica coffee. What we're focusing on is, is the longterm future of coffee production. It's the breeding aspect that's gonna be really important. So I've been doing coffee research for over 20 years and made lots of interesting discoveries, but for me, I think this is the, the discovery or, or the piece of research that we've done that's the most exciting in terms of having an impact longterm. At the end of our conversation, Aaron had a little surprise for me. He gave me a small sample of stenophylla from Sierra Leone that he had left over. I took this back to the roastery to have a proper look, and the first thing we did was to screen out any broken or defective beans from the sample. The preparation of this coffee was pretty different to what we would typically see for specialty arabica coffees. So, in this bowl, 12 grams of Coffea stenophylla beans, ready to be ground, ready to be brewed, ready to be tasted. Because you'll have watched this video up to this point and you'll be desperate to know what does this taste like? My tasting now is not gonna feed into any of the science going on, that, that's already been done, 50 and 60 in tasting panels have already tasted this and declared it to be good, to be interesting, to be of significance. I'm just gonna try and talk about what I'm tasting to try and communicate to you, you know, using some frame of reference you might have, exactly how these taste like or unlike arabica, or like robusta, or like liberica, or anything like that, I'll try and give you as much context as I can without losing myself in ridiculous coffee-tasting language. One interesting thing before I grind the beans is actually their shape is quite unusual, they're kind of a teardrop shape, quite pointed at one ended and rounded at the other. I'm gonna grind these in a hand grinder just 'cause I wanna minimize any retention that an electric grinder might have 'cause grinding them is gonna be the first moment I really get to kind of interact with how they smell. And I get a pretty good idea at that point. Are they good, are they not? I will say my expectations were not super high, having seen the prep, you know, having, having seen the journey these beans have taken to get here. If an arabica had taken a similar journey, I would not have huge expectations. The smell is getting me a little bit excited. There is a kind of very sweet, kind of caramel quality to it. There is a little bit of floral kind of aroma, is in there too, and there's a kind of interesting peachiness to it that's really quite appealing. There is none, none of the earthy, woody, rubbery kind of smells that you might expect with other species, species like robusta, none of the kind of weirdness you might've had if you've tried some of the libericas out there. At this point, I wouldn't know that it wasn't arabica, but I'd be wondering what exactly it was 'cause it does smell a little bit different. That is a lot of kind of very fresh peach. I know I'm sounding a little pretentious, go with me. That's really very pretty. So now we'll put it into the cupping bowl, we'll add our weight of freshly boiled water, we'll steep for four minutes, we'll break the crust, we'll clean it off, and then we'll start to taste, and we'll have an idea what stenophylla could be and could do for coffee. My first taste of stenophylla. Okay. I'm gonna have another one first, I'll talk in a second. One more, one more. When you're tasting like this, you're trying to taste through the layers to get to what the coffee really is, you're trying to taste through a roast that might be slightly imperfect, the processing that might've been slightly imperfect, the prep, all of those things, you try to understand what does the coffee itself taste like. I think the first thing that surprises me about this is that when it comes to arabica, higher-ground coffees tend to have this kind of a lightness about them, they're not very heavy and, and big. They're quite light and quite delicate, and this reminds me of that, it has a lightness to it, it doesn't have a huge, heavy body. It's quite light and bright and sweet and, and kind of open and, and fresh-tasting, almost. A lot of coffees, like robusta, or in many cases, liberica, have a kind of heaviness to them and opposites to them that's quite harsh and aggressive and, and not clean and smooth. This has that, which is really confusing to me. It is not a perfect cup, how could it be a perfect cup, looking at the journey that it's taken. It has a little harshness to it, but just might be a roast issue or a prep issue. But it is ultimately a clean, sweet-tasting coffee that has some acidity. Got some florality, it's got some fruit to it, a kind of stone fruit, a kind of peachy quality that is pleasant, enjoyable. It's a really nice cup, if I drank this, I wouldn't think it wasn't necessarily arabica, I would presume, my brain would only have presumed that this was arabica. It is, it is quite similar in quality. The fact that this is from an entirely different species genetically, a long way away from arabica, is so interesting and so unusual, and actually fills me with a great deal of hope. When we think about why this might be exciting as a coffee, there are two reasons, one, the straight passionate consumer in us would want to drink something new and unusual in this species, and I would love to taste this, you know, harvested at peak ripeness, processed really carefully, you know, given a roasting, given a chance to dial in the roast and, and bring the best out of it, that would be exceedingly exciting to taste. But that, I think, will always be a niche part of this, a small piece of the market. But the idea that that could be possible within the next five years or so is very exciting. I know that's not the instant gratification that we all want and need, but, but five years doesn't feel too far away to be beginning to see this in a coffee shop, for example, and that would be just so cool. The work that is much more interesting and much more important is the work that will outlast the lifetimes of the people doing it now. It's thinking about the longterm future of, of coffee production. This makes me think that there is a chance to have climate-resilient, great coffee.", "videoID": "iGL7LtgC_0I"}, {"title": "The La Pavoni Europiccola", "text": "Welcome to another episode of The Classics of Coffee series where we kind of look at different, almost legendary items, bits of kit from coffee. And today one, I think, well deserving of this place is the La Pavoni Europiccola. It is a home lever machine, and it is absolutely iconic in the coffee industry. It's lasted a long time too. Pavoni produced their first units in 1961. So it's coming up on 60 years old. I have no idea how many Pavoni have sold. It must be thousands upon thousands. They're just everywhere. And people love them. And for good reason. You could argue it achieved true legendary status in 1973 when it appeared in a James Bond film, but the quality of espresso that Roger Moore brews might make him the worst Bond. Let's not get into that right now. Let's talk about this thing here. The way that they work hasn't really changed in nearly 60 years, the design is very simple, very elegant. There have been improvements to componentry and bits and pieces, but they look very, very similar to the day that they started producing them. In fact, this particular unit was made in 1997, which is kind of interesting. I thought for Classics of Coffee, get a classic version. And '97 doesn't feel that long ago but it's also 23 years ago which I don't wanna think about too much anymore. The way they work is very simple. They have a large tank at the back. You just unscrew this thing to get inside and you just pour your water in and seal it up. You have on the side here, and I think they appeared relatively early on though, the first machines didn't have them, is a fill level gauge so you can see how much water is inside the boiler. So you know if there's enough there, or you're running out, or you need to refill it, or you probably shouldn't use it without filling it up first. Once you turn this on there's a little element in the bottom here and it boils like a kettle. It's about 1000 Watts and it will boil the water in here. And once it reaches the desired temperature and pressure it will stop heating. So here's your reservoir of boiling water. Inside there's a little tube that runs from down quite low in the boiler, up through into the grouphead here. And no water can escape because there's a piston in the way. And the way that these things work is when you lift this up, the piston goes up as well, exposing the exit of the little tube in here, meaning water can fill the chamber above the coffee to the piston. That's the water that when you press, you're then driving through the coffee, very simple. If you press with about 20 kilos of force, you'll get about nine bars of pressure in this particular grouphead. And you will see that many of these groupheads are a little bit smaller, the bottom filter baskets are a little bit smaller just to allow easier execution of pressure across it. The bigger the surface area, the harder it is to generate 130 pounds of force per square inch. That's really important. Now because you have boiling water, and you've got steam trapped generating some pressure in here. And on the side here, you've got a steam wand and a little steam valve to control that. So you just open and close the steam valve when you want to steam milk. And it steams okay, but really we're interested in espresso. The thing to do, I guess right now is to turn it on and let's make some espresso. And this thing will just boil quite noisily like a kettle. So now we're hot, it's coming to pressure, but not quite actually. In many cases what you need to do is just purge out any trapped air that may be in the system that will kind of create a false pressure. And you're gonna hear that kick back on and continue to heat up well. And as elegant as the machine is there is a challenge in that thermal management something that you end up talking about a lot whenever you're reviewing lever espresso machines be it ones that you have a built-in boiler for or not temperatures kind of everything. You've got a boiler here running at above boiling point because you're generating steam and that heat will inevitably kind of leach into the group head. And again, the more coffee you make the hotter the group had will get and you'll start to get very high temperatures. Now they advertise this as being able to make eight consecutive coffees but you really wouldn't want to do that. Generally. You want to turn this on get it up to temperature, make your coffee, stims and milk if you want to do that and then shut it down. It's really not designed to be left on for long periods of time. It doesn't perform its best when it's used that way. And for some people that is kind of frustrating for others. That's really no problem at all, as an irritation is there, but clearly, if it was a big problem they wouldn't have sold as many as they have and they wouldn't be so many passionate people who own these and love these. For me if I have one of these every day though I would probably want one of the little temperature stickers on the group head that you might've seen in the criminal review from Gabbo but I'll leave a link to them in the description below. They're not a sponsor or anything. I just think if you're pulling shots on living machines like this and you wanna know what's going on in your group head something like that is actually pretty useful. So the espresso let's go on with that. Now I will say this machine is not hugely tolerant of your pack prep. It might be worse than people kind of experienced that kind of God shot moment where everything comes together and it's amazing. And other times it's only pretty good. You know, that variation is I think because it's quite easy to have this channel or have things go wrong. If you're not doing it right and that's half how you prep the basket and that's half how you use the machine. One of the biggest things does that I've experienced with this machines is quite easy to get would be kind of like a donut extraction. If you look at a naked porta filter you can see a ring of liquid come through first suggesting that water's kind of gotten around the site. In some ways, a lot of people online recommend actually tamping quite softly with this hard enough to compact the cake and to make sure that there's room for water to fill above the coffee in that kind of chamber but not to be particularly aggressive. These aren't big baskets. So I'm dosing around 13 grams of coffee something a little bit smaller but actually a kind of enjoyable dose to me. And then the second thing you really want to worry about is actually how you lift the lever. If you're too aggressive, essentially air has to get in to fill that space before the water gets in. And if you pull up very aggressively the air flowing through the park through the basket will be quite disruptive. So you should be very gentle in how you lift your, your lever up. Once it's up, the Chimp will begin to fill with water. Pre-infusion is beginning at the kind of boiler pressure here, which is around a bar. And then as you get your first drops, you can begin to push. Now this isn't the ideal angle, but we'll make it work. Now this was pulled a little bit longer. This was like about 30 grams out which is a bit more than two to one but I've been happy to sacrifice a little bit of texture and have would have been very drinkable, very enjoyable as process. And that is a lovely little espresso, public clarity. Great sweetness. You could argue that maybe if I got my pressure's a bit better by pulling the lever down at the right angle and not at a weird angle, 'cause I'm making a YouTube video that it might've been better. You might wonder, could this have been a little sweeter if I had nailed the temperature, but is it good? Yes, absolutely. I mean the, in the out we're all good at the timing thought about right. I wouldn't be upset to be said this in a cafe. I'd be happy to drink it at home. First thing in the morning this would be a very nice way to start my day. These are tanks. It seems like you can buy them secondhand from all sorts of years of manufacturer. They'd been around a long, long time. They're not overly expensive as a brand new thing. I think they're about 550 euros. That's not cheap, but you know the last machine I think we reviewed was the Kremmina which was thousands of euros. And this is not thousands. This is a half a thousand euros. There are certainly available. Second hand too. There's tons on eBay or other places that you might find in your local country. And they're not particularly difficult to clean or maintain. There's a lot, a lot of moving parts. There's not a lot of gaskets to change around the piston head. You'd worry about limescale and that kind of stuff. But again, it's a pretty simple tank and set up to D scale. In terms of frustrations, there aren't too many, there's a couple of things. One, this thing is incredibly hot to the touch. It will burn you if you put your hand on it. It is at a hundred degrees Celsius kind of thing. So, just be wary of that. This is not a child-friendly or safe in any way. It's very, very hot. And because it's a pressure vessel and you're essentially filling it like a kettle but sealing the top. If you need to replenish the water tank you have to dip pressurize and cool the machine down completely get rid of all the steam in there and before you can open this poor, fresh, cold water and close it back down again and heat it back up again. So if you've forgotten to fill it and you're running low on water, that's annoying. If you've already gotten a hot if you're trying to make coffees for multiple people it's not super easy, but if it's just you making espresso for you in the morning, you might want to have a great time. And as you can see, the wide has been so popular. It feels intuitive. It feels easy. It's small. It would fit under any kitchen cabinet and still be easy to load with water or make a coffee with. The Euro Piccolo is small by name but it is a Titan in the world of espresso. It's been around 60 years now or very nearly. And I think it will be around a lot longer too. It's not high-tech, it's very simple. The components are easy to replace, easy to change. It's not a complicated machine to take to pieces D scale, any of that stuff. It's robust. It lasts for a long time, years and years, decades. In fact, in this case 23 years, and it looks fantastic. It makes great coffee. It's excellent condition. Thanks to its careful owner. This I'll give away like anything else that I review through Patrion. And this was actually bought from one of my Patrion backers. So thank you very much for connecting me with this little machine. It's been fun to do a classic of coffee with an older unit though. I don't imagine the coffee would tasted that different out of one manufactured in 2020. A few components may have changed. The drip tray may have changed, but the coffee it makes I think is very similar to what it made in the 60s. And that's a kind of cool thing to have in your house to make coffee with every day. It's something that has absolutely stood the test of time quirks and all. If you're thinking about getting one, do some reading do some research, learn about getting the best out of them but I've got to say it's been a real pleasure to use and having the studio, if only briefly. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. Do you have one of these? Did it take you a little while to kind of tweak and find your way around to getting the best espresso that you can get out of it? Does the temperature thing frustrate you? Do you manage that temperature in different ways? You're using cold cloths on group heads or are you flushing water through sometimes? I would love to hear what you're using, what you like, what you don't like. All of that stuff. Please talk to us down in the comments below. One more quick thing. The ultimate V60 technique poster is now available. Beautiful designed by Ross Becker. It's available linked down below. Again it's limited, like all the things we do at 10s, 100s, 1000s I think it's lovely. I love having it on the wall. I love the colors or the design.", "videoID": "lKimj0vRM5A"}, {"title": "Ceramic Coffee Filters\uff1a Magical or Maddening\uff1f", "text": "Today, we're going to talk about this. It is a ceramic coffee filter. It's a brewer and a filter all in one. It's just one thing. You put coffee in, you pour water on top, you get a cup of coffee out of the other side. How does it work? Is it a good thing? Is it the zero waste answer the coffee brewing? Is it just TikTok fodder? Let's find out. These ceramic brewers have been around for a little while now. I think this material, this kind of interesting ceramic material was invented in 1986 by a company called Kyuemon in Japan. They do things for plants and things for coffee, because both benefit, I guess, from a porous ceramic material. It's a weird one. If you look at it, you can put a bright light behind it, no light comes through. It's not like there are little direct channels through the bed, and it's filtering that way. Instead, I guess this is more like crushed together, smushed-together pieces that form a kind of maze and the water has to run through and the brewed coffee can get through, but the pieces of coffee can't, thus you have filtration without the need for paper or metal or anything like that. Definitely interesting. They've had a bit of a resurgence lately. This one isn't made by Kyuemon. This one's made by a company called 224 There is I think one called a Loca that's doing the rounds that I think has spurred the recent round of interest. I first bought one of these I think maybe in 2009. I'd gone to Japan. I was in a department store in Tokyo called Toku Hands, and I bought everything that I could find that made coffee that I'd never seen before, and one of these was included. So I used it, I brewed with it, I formed an opinion, and I stopped brewing with it, and I want to talk about why, what's good about it, what's bad about it, and I guess to do that, we should make some coffee. As I said, this one comes from 224, which also comes with this. This is like a holder for it to sort of suspend it above your brewer. I think it's a beautiful color. I don't love the moment when you sort of... Oh, crunch it into place, but that's sort of how you would brew with it. Now, they do say you should really give them a good rinse before you use them, especially the first time. This one's made a bit of coffee today, but it should still, you know, benefit from a little rinse. We'll talk about cleaning at the end, 'cause there's quite a lot to talk about when it comes to cleaning. Let me get some hot water. Now, you can see the way that the water comes right through the brewer. It's kind of interesting. That'll impact how we brew with it later. Now, as I said, I've made a few cups of coffee with this today. I have cleaned it thoroughly, but you can still see a little color in the water. It does seemingly cling on to things that you don't want it to after you've brewed with it, which is a little frustration. Now, I ground a little bit coarse for this. They do recommend grinding coarser in all the kind of supporting materials for all of the brewers, really. I guess they're trying to avoid clogging, but I still need to extract the coffee properly. Anyway, let's brew as we would a V60. Now, I'm brewing a 15g to 250ml, so a relatively small brew. I don't recommend brewing much larger brews with this particular brewer, either. So kind of one cup at a time is kind of what I would say is the limit. Now, I've gone backwards and forwards in terms of technique. I've gone for the kind of low bed and slow flow, but actually, that doesn't work super well for me, so I've kind of gone back to as I brew a V60, where, you know, we're gonna pour a little bit faster, we're gonna fill the brewer up, have a bigger thermal mass, but also this seems to prevent clogging and stalling that I've had issues with brewing the kind of low and slow method. Regardless of that, you are going to have a slower brew than you would do with pretty much any other sort of filtration device. This definitely prolongs the contact time quite a bit when you brew. So we have coffee and while it cools down, we do need to talk about some of the kind of eyebrow-raising claims on the websites of these drippers that you'll see, and that's mostly to do with far infrared radiation. You'll see the claims that, because these things emit far infrared radiation, or FIR, that they improve the taste of the coffee that way. You'll see them sort of suggested to be adequate water filters, to just pour water through these things. Now, there may be some active carbon present in them. I don't know. That would obviously clean up some negative tastes. As for the far infrared radiation, there seems to be a lot of good research around the benefits from a health perspective or a treatment perspective of FIR, but the whole makes your coffee taste better feels much closer to difficult-to-prove stuff. I'm not sure in all of the brews that I've had from these brewers that it tastes like something magical has happened from the brewer improving the taste of the water, improving the taste of the coffee. All ceramics to some extent emit far infrared radiation, and other kinds of radiation, too, and the amount that they emit is tied to how hot they are. In this case, you know, 90 degrees Celsius is a little hot, but not incredibly hot, where you'd have a much higher level of emission. So I'm just very skeptical of that. If you have good well-researched information, please leave a comment down below, 'cause I'd actually like to learn more about this and kind of whether there's anything to it, or whether really there's some medical benefits to intense levels of FIR, or what's going on. I just want to know. I don't know. Educate me. On this channel, you'll see me say this a lot, which is if you take good coffee, you grind it well, add good water, brew with a sense of sensible technique, you're kind of most of the way there, and that's true of this. We did the good coffee and good water thing, and you can taste that in the brew, but these brewers consistently for me have a taste. A taste of the brewer that I can't get rid of, but I can't quite get past, and it's really hard to describe what it is, 'cause it doesn't necessarily taste like what you might expect, which is kind of old, stale coffee trapped inside it. That isn't the taste. It isn't that kind of rancid, bitter old coffee flavor thing. It's something else. It's almost kind of, not quite cereal-y, not quite kind of papery. It's just something just unsettling and not quite right in the coffee, and I don't want it to be there, but it's definitely there. Other people may not be as sensitive to it as I am, but if I know what the coffee tastes like, then almost everything I'm trying to do when I brew coffee is maintain some level of transparency and just taste the coffee and not taste the mistakes or the issues of the water or the brewing or all of that kind of stuff, and I feel like there's just a little layer of flavor that I don't like, added to the top of this brewer. So there's two things to talk about. Firstly, there's cleaning, which I really need to talk about and will make me a little bit irate and also frustrated with the paradoxical nature of this brewer, and also who is this brewer for? Both of these things, we'll have a look at after an ad for this video's sponsor, which is Squarespace.

Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So let's talk about cleaning, because honestly, it's not good. It's not good. At the end of the brew, you'll have your sort of hopefully reasonably dry bed. These things do, as I said, have a tendency to stall, and they say don't use detergents, so you're gonna rinse this under a tap, and they say use lots and lots of hot water to get as much of the kind of coffee oil and stuff out. It's not like a sieve, right, where you can sort of turn it over and sort of blow sort of stuff off the inside with hot water coming through. It doesn't work that way, so it's all gotta be just in with your hand. Do not use any sort of material here, no scrubbers, nothing like that. This collects any sort of material very easily. Don't dry it with a tea towel. Don't do any of that, 'cause fluff accrues. So you're really using your hand as much as possible, or maybe like a scrubbing brush or something like that. It's not particularly fun, and even if you do that, you tend to find that this will clog over time. Now, they say two things. You can boil this in water, is one option, or you can sort of invert it and leave it on top of a medium setting gas flame for about 15 minutes, which is a long time, and essentially, that's probably gonna work quite well because after about 15 minutes, this will be hot enough that you will have turned to ash any organic material left inside this thing, right? Like the ceramic is gonna be stable to incredibly high temperatures, but coffee will burn and turn to just carbon and ash before that point, and that's what you're gonna do, which I don't know if that seems good. You could probably get like your Bripe's blue flame lighter and have a go at that, but you know, you're probably not gonna get the temperatures you need easily without burning through a full dose of fuel for that thing. So cleaning it, neither of those make me feel good, and then the fact that you need to use a lot of hot water for it, also not appealing, right? It needs a lot of rinsing before, after, all of that stuff, and if you think about what you're saving, which is a paper, like a filter paper, which is, you know, not even a gram of paper versus all of the hot water and energy that you use to clean this thing, this is, because it is zero waste, less sustainable, right? Like the paper, in the great scheme of things, in the cradle to grave perspective, the paper's probably better and certainly quicker and easier. You just sort of pinch the paper out, throw it in the trash, into the food waste, if you can do that. Quick rinse, and your brew is ready to go, but this, this is just a lot more work. So if you're trying to brew back to back, it's not easy. Am I saying that no one should buy one of these? No, I wouldn't go that far. There is something kind of magical about how this thing works. It's amazing. It's fun. It's kind of a novelty, maybe. I have enjoyed buying one and using one and showing it to people, and they've been kind of impressed to some extent or confused or just, you know, amused, entertained by seeing it make a coffee.", "videoID": "fSuqlZna6Tg"}, {"title": "Understanding Espresso - Grind Size (Episode #4)", "text": "Welcome to the Understanding Espresso series, a series where we take apart on individual variable in the espresso making process. In the past, we've looked at dose in, ratio and brew time. Today, we're looking at the most complex of the variables in my opinion, which is the grind setting. how fine or how coarse you should be grinding the coffee, and when you should use your grind setting to make an adjustment to taste. Espresso is a lot of fun, but it's also immensely frustrating, especially when you're starting out. And I would say, this variable is by far the most frustrating of all of them to work with. And I'll give you the reasons why. And there's kind of three reasons. So let's say you make a grind setting change going a little bit finer. In doing so, you'll expose a lot more surface area of the ground coffee. If you think about cutting an apple into big pieces, there's not that much surface area, but if you diced it down into tiny pieces, you'd expose a lot more of the inside of an apple, and the same is true with a coffee bean. And so far, that's good news. More surface area is very useful for extracting more coffee flavor. But when you change the surface area, you also change the way that the grounds interconnect with each other. And when you tamp them down in your little pack of coffee, the finer the pieces are, the better they fit together, and the harder it is for the water to flow through them. This will increase the contact time between the water and the coffee. So you have this one change to surface area that impacts flow rate and contact time as well, and that's a bit of a headache. And then for an extra twist, quite often, changing the grind setting is a little bit wasteful. Now, this isn't true of every single grinder ever made but it's very true of many, many, many coffee grinders people use for espresso. They don't perfectly push out all of the coffee that they grind every time that you use them inside the grinding chamber that houses the burrs as well as the exit chute, you'll often find some residual ground coffee and that was ground at a setting maybe before you made a change. So when you make a change, you need to purge out some coffee, to push out to these old grounds that are sort of set at the wrong ground setting with some new ones. And that's frustrating because some grinders need a lot of purging and others don't. But either way, that's coffee that you never get to drink. That's coffee that you waste. And so, changing the grind setting is frustrating, but it's necessary. Without grinding finely enough, you can't do the extraction work that you need to, to get all the good flavor out using only a little bit of water. And that's the kind of nature of espresso because you want to use just a little bit of water to have a strong, concentrated, thick, delicious, gooey, sweet espresso at the end of it. Now just quickly, I wanna go back just through how we got to this point, a little bit of history. People worked out pretty early on that to brew faster you had to grind finer, that way this increased surface area meant that those flavors were more accessible. But quickly you get to the point where there was a problem. Finely ground coffee is difficult to get water through. And in the early years of espresso, different methods were found to increase the pressure that the water was pushed through with the coffee. Eventually, with compressed springs, we got to the kind of pressures that we use today, around nine bars of pressure. It's equivalent in strange money of 130 psi, but ultimately, it's nine atmospheres of pressure. And that is a lot of pressure. That causes problems in espresso brewing. Generally speaking, you wanna go as fine as you can expose as much surface area as you can, before you break the puck. Espresso brewing happens at these very fine pressures and they are dependent on resistance coming from the coffee cake. But at some point, that very high pressured water may well find a channel through which to run, an easier pathway. And what happens when an espresso puck essentially breaks is that it begins to channel and more water begins to flow through less of the coffee. Channeling happens in most expressos at some point and to varying degrees. But as you go finer and finer and finer, you increase the likelihood of the channel forming because you created such a lot of resistance to the water pressure. Now the grind is not the only variable that dictates how good a job your puck does of creating even resistance throughout the whole brew. Obviously, the depth of the puck will play a role, as does your puck preparation and how evenly the coffee is distributed before you tamp it down. Often people will talk about over extraction when you grind a little bit too fine. I know I've done that too, and we associate that word with very bitter flavors coming through in your espresso. Generally speaking, the puck as a whole may not actually be over extracted. The puck as a whole maybe under extracted actually. But the areas around the channels where water has flowed much faster and in higher volumes, they are extremely over extracted. So they've given up more flavor than we want, and they've added that bitter harshness to the shots, but you'd argue that's really more uneven extraction than it is over extraction. Or just localized over extraction rather than total over extraction. Because again, if you're measuring this stuff with refractometers, and looking at your total yields, you won't see a big increase in extraction, that incredibly fine grained, you'll actually see a drop. And in the past, this actually pushed people to experiment with a much coarser grind than is typically used for espresso, in a paper that was published, and I made a video about that, so you should check that video out, up here, when you're done watching this one. Now, I'm not gonna say you have to use very coarse grains, because you end up needing to use a higher ratio to get a more balanced shot. But you do get a more even extraction using these slightly coarser grounds than you do using rare finely ground coffee, but your end result does feel and taste and have kind of different texture and strength to it. So let's talk about using grind on much more practical way. I would definitely use grind to first and foremost, get my flow rate about right. Let's say I'm looking for an 18 grams in 36 grams out in around 30 seconds. Well, I'm gonna use my grind setting to get me to that point. But once I'm there, I'm gonna taste it and chances are, the tweaks I'm gonna make, if the espresso is good, but not perfect, are gonna be two other variables that we'll discuss. If I'm still a long way, away from good tasting, I say I'm still very sour, I'm gonna go finer again, and see how that does, even if it's outside of my original spec. But if I get my grind setting approximately correct, then I'm gonna make those little tweaks with dose, with yield, potentially with temperature in some cases but unlikely, but primarily, I would suspect with my coffee in and my coffee out. They're gonna let me fine tune that recipe, pretty easily. Now the reason I like to use grind like this for the big changes, but maybe not as often when I'm tweaking is actually largely practical. If you're a beginner or intermediate in the world of espresso, then I think making less grind changes is probably an easier thing. There's waste from purging, there's just the general frustration around making those changes and making them accurately, especially if you have a new grinder or you're just new to the process. So I think big changes with the grind are good. And also if you have a stepped grinder where the steps between each setting are quite large, then again, I would go probably for the finer of the two, even if that means dropping down my dose and that kind of stuff. 'cause I'm just more likely to have a good experience that way than being stuck with a slightly coarser grind that I might want. If I lived in a world with unlimited coffee, unlimited time and resources, then I would use grind to really, really, really make small adjustments. But that needs a very good grinder, a lot of patience and quite a lot of waste. And I'm not sure that's great real word sort of advice or recommendations. So I would say, you're more likely to enjoy your espressos and the espresso making process if you're not throwing away a ton of coffee each time. So at the risk of repeating myself, use your grind to get close, get good tasting espresso. If things are dominantly sour, you need to grind a little bit finer. If you're finding things are getting a little bit too bitter and harsh, or you're getting a lot of channeling, then maybe come back a little bit coarser. I'll summarize all this in a second. I'll give you some basic rules for using grind. But first, I wanna talk about the sponsor of this video, which is Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community full of thousands of classes for creative and curious people like you and me.

Thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video. So to wrap up, I'll give you a few simple rules to use when thinking about grind setting. So rule one, once again, use it to get in the ballpark of tasty. Fix your recipe, don't vary that, just use your grind setting to get to pretty good and then tweak from there using your other variables in the recipe. Rule two. Generally speaking, push it as fun as you can before you start to see channeling happening. Now channeling will be very obvious if you're using a naked portafilter and you'll start to see uneven flow in your basket especially in the last third of the espresso, but you can also see it in the spotted portafilter, you'll just be looking for a sudden increase in flow rate as coffee starts to gush out of their spouts in the last third of the of the chart or potentially the last half if things have gone really wrong. Channelled espressos tend to taste a little bit weaker than you expect, kind of hollow. They have this acidity coupled with this bitterness that you get in the finish, this kind of harsh biting aftertaste. In the past I've even recommended grinding from some grinders into a little collection chamber or bucket or tin or something, shaking out any potential clumps and then dosing into your portafilter from there, for this kind of a reason. Puck prep is really important, but going to fine will produce channeling, kind of no matter what. Rule three. Only change one flow related variable at a time. If you're changing your grind, do not change the dose of coffee in your bucket the same time. You won't understand or get insight into the impact of either one that way, and you won't know what's gone right or what's gone wrong. So if you're changing your grind, keep everything else the same, so you can understand the nature of the change that you've made. And rule four, purging is essential. And it's better to purge and waste five grams of coffee than it is to waste the whole dose that you ground incorrectly, pull the shot off and waste it.", "videoID": "er2voEn8ZDU"}, {"title": "My WBC Winning Routine\uff1a Analysis, Tips, Tricks & Stories", "text": "I wanted to do something a little bit different today It's been over ten years now since I last competed in barista competition but I thought it would be fun to go back and kind of watch through my performance as it was back then and Maybe explain a little bit about what was going on and some key things that I learnt from Competing from practicing that may be useful to you if you want to compete in barista championships Before we get started sadly there is not a high quality copy of this available This is the best there is and it's still pretty pixelated.

Forgive me in my past fashion indiscretions or whatever you want to say and let's get into Competing in Tokyo in 2007 in the world barista championship final. So Let's dive in It is with my great pleasure that I introduce World Barista Championship. Finalist number three The barista champion of the United Kingdom. Mr. James Hoffman So just a quick thing to start us off I just have to give Nick Cho a quick shout-out here he is probably my favorite emcee, and I can't Overstate the value of how good he is to make you feel as a competitor by bringing you on as the Barista Champion of the United Kingdom back when I was competing that wasn't really normal and it just felt really good and I have to say his voice is turned his Manner he is I think the the quintessential WBC emcee. So just a quick shout out to Nick Cho I won't pause this too much I'll try and talk it over the top when I'm when I'm not speaking in the performance, but you know Just let thinking back thinking about this. It seems worthy of a shout out. Alright Back we go Good morning, sir. Good morning well-rested. I hope yeah, I lost my voice a little bit, but I'll try and speak up today Very good. Are you ready? I am judges. Are we ready? World Barista Championship finalist when you're ready, please start your timer and begin your presentation. Thank you My name is James I am delighted to be here I'm actually going to start today with a little bit of signature drink preparation. I Wanted to create a drink that used all the ingredients that through their flavor marriage with coffee have become part and parcel of the ritual Of sitting back and really enjoying a cup of coffee. It's that cup that you want not that cup that you need Now I'm going to start two parts here on stage today. The first part is a bit of a challenge I like to turn foods into parts of drink. So I'm going to recreate biscotti as a clone now You can't use the finished biscuit. So I'm going to use the key ingredients and Infuse them just into water so the power just some still water and into that We're gonna add some almonds and some toasted hazelnuts. I Like the recipes of a biscotti that have a little rosemary in there add something to the nose, it's really nice. A little gelatin And just to sweeten that up just a little sugar syrup That will infuse on the hob at the same time I'm gonna do another infusion with a slightly unusual ingredient, which is tobacco Now I want this not just for the really interesting flavor marriage, but also for the sensation it's going to bring to the drink So we just have some half-and-half here And some tobacco and they're both gonna heat up If you get a chance, please do reach forward and just smell the tobacco. It has the most incredible aroma So while it's infusing, I'll prepare you each an espresso. Thank you Okay, I have to pause there just for a second. There's a few different things. I want to unpack about about that intro Firstly and this is a key thing You have a really small number of words in a barista competition Performance and you have to be quite careful about how you spend your allocation of words so for me a big part of this routine as it was back then was to spend as much time at the table with the judges as I could Everything that could be done at the table I did at the table because words have much more impact when you're close to someone when you're face to face secondly a Huge part of Barista competition I think is about trying to prime a judge to feel good about giving you a high score It's about making them Excited to taste something making them feel good about you making them Open to to giving a high score that's going to put them in a position where they're gonna feel Potentially a little bit of judgment from their fellow judges, you know They want to feel comfortable that when they say this is a five out of six That no one else in the room is gonna say are you insane? Right? So psychology with judges plays a huge role It's why I think often judges can make quite flawed barista trainers because they presume judges to be kind of infallible When they're really not so This drink. I love to pieces and I worked with the Fat Duck a restaurant in the UK Heston Blumenthal is the head chef, they're quite famous -- the proprietor. I worked with a guy Chris Young Who is the head of their food research lab. He now runs a company called ChefSteps and He was hugely helpful in this drink Which we'll come back to in a little bit and I'll let me get on with making some some espresso Now as I'm faffing away and prepping there a couple of key things that people asked at the time one Why did I use K 30 grinders at the time people didn't think they were cool everyone loved Roberts and The truth was that I used those grinders because Malkin Inc were willing to lend me two grinders to compete with I had no money no budget and I didn't have an issue with what other people had issues with in terms of clumping who people were really weirded out at the time that I'd used it. now Competition is kind of a head wrecker because there's almost infinite choices of coffees to serve to those judges So you've got to have a damn good reason to pick what you picked and at the time in 2007 It was such a different time, right? It was all blends all trying to compose really sweet rich round balanced things and I just didn't find that Interesting. I like the idea of just tasting one thing one farm one place and so that's why I chose a single estate from Costa Rica because at the time No one expected that to make a really great espresso And that's another key tip: playing with people's expectations is really useful It's quite powerful when you I think deliver well on it, and I served a really unusual Espresso -- certainly for the time. Now it wouldn't be considered that weird. But back then it kind of did. So Expectations are there to be messed with and you can set them and break them exceed them. Whatever you going to do But but that should factor into your coffee choices Whilst I do enjoy the same heavy-bodied chocolatey espressos I also like to explore coffee and this seemed a great opportunity just to serve you something very very different So I chose something perhaps a little unexpected In the cup On the nose certainly you should get a hint of hazelnut, roast hazelnuts and nougat but in the company should be light, delicate, fresh Please please really really stir this up because at the bottom of the shot is the sweetest part. Just give the most Wonderful finish will linger all the way up to your cappuccino Quick note, you're going to catch me saying the word \"enjoy\" way too much in this performance I think I'd been reading a bunch about NLP Neuro-linguistic programming and I was trying to do embedded commands or something like that a little bit I was very influenced by people like Derren Brown on this point This doesn't work Or maybe it does a little bit. But but feel free to mock me in the comments on that one now caps again I chose to do something that was considered unusual at the time which was used a single estate coffee from Kenya which Was the sort of antithesis of what people were trying to mix with milk to create a really balanced coffee drink But I figured the super juicy fruity thing expressed in that really well was really clear. Much more important though was my failure What I what I failed to do was consider my descriptors properly I used the descriptive blackcurrant quite a lot in this. I later found out that some of the judges didn't know what that word Meant. Blackcurrants aren't actually particularly universal as fruits They're not very common in the US for example. So be very thoughtful about the positioning your judges have when you try and put descriptors into their heads and into their minds Being incredibly specific can backfire on you Now a couple more things I used to shake horribly during barista competitions I would get really nervous and I would shake a lot and while I shake a little bit here I didn't shake that much and I'll tell you why. I didn't drink that much coffee before going on stage. And this is huge. Like I tasted half of one espresso before I rolled out for practice time Because what's easy to do is taste five six Seven eight ten shots backstage trying to dial in and you hit the stage and you're nervous and you just shake like a leaf So I would recommend having a team with you that can taste Get you in the ballpark and when you are close to dialed in then you taste, nail your descriptors, but you go on stage Not very caffeinated Second key thing here It's about knowing the rules and knowing how to bend them. Back then the rule was all four drinks had to be served simultaneously So most competitors made off all caps brought them to the table put them down And that was serving them I emailed and said can I pour my drinks tableside? They said, yes sure because I think they thought I would bring them up, pour all four, put them down and that would be that Instead, having got their permission, I poured them one at a time and spoke to each judge as I did it to give me more time Face to face with each judge and that I think was crucial and it became very quickly I think quite normal in barista competition once once someone had bent the rule it just sort of moved the goal posts Third big tip practice making mistakes. In the first round of this competition Actually in the first round the year before I had failed to properly shut off my cappuccino shots But I practiced messing up so I made up the time. I finished a good time. I knew where to cut corners practice practice practice and practice making mistakes So for my cappuccinos Whilst again, I do enjoy that espresso that's turned into chocolate and that's my milk. I also wanted to serve you something different here. I wanted to find a coffee that could offer a different kind of Interpretation of what a cappuccino can be and in one single estate again, I found just that So the estate that I've used for the cappuccino blend is one called Getanwini (?) it's in Kenya and as far as push i promise it's my favorite coffee this year I've been drinking a lot of it as filter coffee and it's one of those coffees that just not taste like across Terrible terrible latte art terrible foam depth. I know. These did not score that well So you can see here the the the judge in the kind of turquoise blue top She's singer Dora witnessed one of the lowest moments of my career in 2005 When I was competing in the UK finals and I dropped three cappuccinos all over myself So to have her as a judge in the finals when I won was was actually a really lovely moment of Circuitousness of closing a loop, I guess I really really enjoyed drinking this as I practiced, I'm really enjoying serving this to you today. So I really hope you enjoy it. There's a story about enjoy that until you write at the end after this thing is over that I think is hugely important for understanding This whole performance or thought or why it might have worked away why the judges liked it? It's Not a not a great cap in terms of foam and all that kind of stuff All right. So let's talk a little bit about the Sig drink. There's a really strange thing happens here on stage where We all arrived in Japan and discovered that if you wanted to use a Korean whipper the little nitrous charges Were illegal because they're they're they're a a kind of controlled drug in Japan in a way So what you'll see me do in a second is hand off my Korean whipper to Stephen Morrissey who who is my kind of coach and He charges it backstage Because there's a special machine to do that and sort of brings it back later. So it was really super confusing and strange Again anticipate the the the hard to anticipate. I in my first heat in the finals the two hot plates blew in the first round and my hot Drink was not hot. It ended up being a cold drink and I didn't realize until I was putting them down on the table They did offer me a chance to to go again, but but I I didn't take it. I still made it to the finals and you know, that was good, but Again, it was a good reminder for me that things go wrong. Practice, adapt, check Really well with this drink but equally that the fruit from the pain worked really well with the tobacco so for this drink I'll be using two shots of the Costa Rican coffee mixed also with two shots of the Kenyan getting win now that'll go into the tobacco infused cream with a little chocolate and that will Be the bottom of the drink and the biscotti foam on top This drink was actually really really delicious, but we'll come back to that. Again, Know the rules and know how you can bend or break them What was done here by pulling two shots of one coffee Two shots of another was at the time right in the gray area of the rules So, you know You can do things if you know the rules really well. People compete without reading every single rule and I think they're insane This is a game based on making coffee and I think you set yourself every advantage by knowing those rules super super well Speaking of rule changes you might catch a an inappropriate word of the music at some point The year after this they made it illegal to have swear words or inappropriate words in your barista competition music I didn't really think about it too much. My music choice actually was stuff I liked to listen to but I couldn't really hear it when I was on stage I was too focused and apart from the very last track, which is there to sort of set a mood, it was just stuff I liked and thought would be cool to play A lot of people were doing kind of elevatory music type stuff and that just never really Fit with me that well and Steven took it further the year after and just played a really fun soundtrack that really got audience going This was just kind of stuff I was into at the time. I regret nothing. One final thing -- There are four glasses there. I have a had a spare or two. They both broke backstage. Pack extra spares You will always need more spare things. Bring extras. Do not do what I did and roll out on stage with four glasses only. If I had dropped one, broken one, damaged one Game over. That's not smart. Anecdote I did almost kill Heston Blumenthal with an iteration of this drink we gave him heart palpitations by giving him a a sort of a tonic or infusion of cigars that was not was not good for humans to ingest so, you know It was a strange day Final note as he drinks. I keep saying final though. I know Creativity is often misconstrued here. This drink has chocolate, nuts, cream, sugar in it Those are the most obvious pairings in the world with coffee Yet I think you can still be creative with those. This won best signature drink that year, so The ingredients are not what make it creative Like to go and you're gonna have a cup of coffee and really enjoy When I drink this i like to take the times I like to start with a little spoonful of the biscotti foam and then drink it down. You're welcome to stir it -- you don't need to What I do like is that just as I swallow a little while later on I got a warm tingle in the tobacco coming through when I get that I like to sip again and just let the coffee and chocolate wash over that I really like this So again in the language I was still definitely trying to prep the judges to have a good experience trying to get them to think about Being somewhere they wanted to be. All of that kind of stuff I think contributes to a judge having a better experience on stage What what I'm doing by moving the trays underneath back again know the rules back then they didn't judge underneath the table for cleanliness So if you get as much stuff off your table, it wouldn't be count as being messy or or judged in their sort of cleanup score in your text sheet It's so funny to watch this back Barista champion from the United Kingdom James Hoffman. So I'll tell one final kind of story as I fade myself out here which was In 2008 I was invited to an event in Poland and They said hey two of the judges who judged you are here. So why don't you go up on stage and Tell the story of your routine and they'll come up afterwards and they'll tell the story of judging it, and so I deep dived right I went into like how I was trying to do clever things with the Espresso and the sig drink and the caps and and all that sort of neat technical things I was doing, how I was trying to subvert some of the tropes that back then Everyone started the competition performance is the same way. They were like \"Hi judges, today I will be serving you four espressos, four cappuccinos and four signature drinks.\".", "videoID": "DwZV17bek4"}, {"title": "My Nemesis\uff1a The Coffee Scoop", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about the scoop, the coffee scoop. Now, I have maligned the scoop previously. I'm not a fan of the scoop. I've said bad things about the scoop. I've said it's not particularly accurate. I said dosing by volume doesn't set you up for success. But people get angry with me for being fussy and pretentious and difficult and they're probably right. But I still believe that they're not really your friend, because I think coffee-making is easy as long as you're paying attention to the right things. And I think one of the right things to pay attention to is exactly how much coffee you're using when you make a cup and I don't think these are very accurate. And I need to prove that for myself as well as also for you, but there's a problem. I kind of wanna call this video 'why scoops are bad'. I have a bit of a bias. So if I demonstrate to you why scoops are bad, if I show variance in scooping that this is quite big, you'll just say, well, of course you found that to be the case. You used the scoop wrong. You did it weird. You set yourself up to succeed, and that's a fair point. And so we're gonna need the help of other people, the general public and so that's what we're gonna do today. We're gonna venture out into the world and we're gonna find somewhere where we can get people to scoop coffee. We'll give them a choice of scoops. We'll give them a choice of different coffees to scoop. We'll scoop grounds and we'll scoop beans because why not? And at the end of it, hopefully we've got some data to say definitively or not, scoops are great or scoops are terrible. So we went to Prufrock, we set up a little experiment there 'cause we could do it inside but kind of out of the way in the window away from everyone else. And as I said, the experiment was quite simple. We gave people a choice of scoops and then they had to scoop three scoops of a coffee of their choice, ground into three little cups and then scoop some beans of their choice into three little cups again and what we wanted to see was how consistent were they? And it was a pretty simple test. I put out a little tweet to say, we were shooting a little video at Prufrock. If people were around, wanted a free coffee, wanted come down and people did. So in an hour of testing, we got a good amount of data. We have over a hundred scoops of data. Would I have liked more data? Well, obviously more data is always good, but do I have enough data to draw some interesting conclusions? I think I do. Do I get the unequivocal proof that the scoop is indeed terrible? Maybe not. And I'll give you the results and some conclusions I can draw from it after this short ad for this video sponsor, which is Squarespace.

So let's start with the good news and that's the good news is that the things that support my inherent bias against the scoop. Firstly, the most obvious thing, a scoop is not a scoop. What does that mean? Well, if you ask someone to give you a scoop of coffee, you will get a staggering variance in how much coffee that you get. With this scoop here, it's quite a small scoop, we got anywhere from five grams to 14.5 grams. That is a lot of variance. That is, if you tell someone to do three scoops of coffee, you could end up with an enormously different cup of coffee just from someone using the scoop differently. So on that point, I feel quite validated. Now, the average variance wasn't that high. The variance bounced around a little bit. Some people were more accurate than others if they knew that they were being tested and understood the test, they did better unsurprisingly. But we asked everyone to act as if they were making coffee, to be careful not to be kind of chaotic with their scooping, but to use a scoop as they might to make a coffee. Now, five to 15 seems like I'm pulling extremes out and in some ways I am, but those extremes exist. But at the same time, the average for this scoop was about eight grams. That was the most common dosage, but only a third of the doses weighed with this scoop averaged out to about eight grams or rounded out to about eight grams. So yeah, it produces a wide range of results and some pretty extreme variances. Secondly, there's no standard for scoops. There is no internationally agreed size of scoop. This is a sort of tablespoon I suppose, as a volumetric formal measurement, this is not. And so if you say use my scoop, you'll have a good amount of variance. But if you say in a recipe, use a scoop, who knows what you're gonna get. It's just gonna be chaos. You're gonna get all sorts of everything. I think it's a bad unit for that particular reason. So the third thing, iceberg theory applies to scoops. If iceberg theory is a thing. Scoops are like icebergs, just go with me for a second. I think deeper, narrower scoops are better than wider scoops because most people will overfill a scoop. What you see here is there'll be a fixed amount below the line, and if that's a good size dose, that's a good thing. It means your percentage variance above this is smaller. There's a relatively small amount of excess here which would be your typical overage by mistake. Whereas if you take a much wider spoon, you just get a bigger amount over the water so to speak, if you imagine it as an iceberg, and less under the water. So you have a smaller consistent amount and a larger overage amount. That's probably more than I needed to think about scoops. But I would just say if I was designing a scoop, a deeper narrower scoop is more consistent in usage than a wider one. But here is where things begin to fall apart for me and my high hopes of total domination over the scoop. It turns out that scooping beans produces the same amount of variation in dose as scooping grounds does, which really surprised me. I actually thought scooping beans would produce more variance, but no, the standard deviation across the doses for each person measured and the average standard deviation was the same scooping beans as scooping grounds. So if you are a bean scooper, don't feel bad about it. It's no worse than scooping grounds. I mean, it's no better than scooping grounds. You're still at scooping and they're still variance, but you are no worse off than a ground coffee scooper. So. Last point, and this is the one that upsets me the most. Several people were incredibly consistent in how they used the scoop. Now, most of the time they knew what we were doing and so they were paying attention, but they were as consistent as I would expect someone to be with a set of digital scales, measuring to 0.1 of a gram. Their variance was 0.1, 0.2 of a gram across three doses. So scoops work, if you're paying attention. And I guess the lesson for me is there's probably a time and a place for scoops. But if you're out and about, if you don't have access to scales, if you pay attention, you can get a good result with a coffee scoop. You can be accurate. What you have to do is think about how you're dosing and pay real attention to it. Those of us who were making coffee before grind-to-order grinders used to dose coffee with our hands volumetrically using the basket of the portafilter. And we'd fill it up, we'd smooth out the edges and sweep it off. There were lots of funny techniques with funny names like the Stockfleths move to sort of get the most even sort of uniform distribution and consistent dose. The same stuff applies here. If you tap to settle, you'll load more coffee in. So don't do that too much, or if you tap, do it consistently each time. A gentle soft sideways motion to sweep will give you incredibly consistent results, and that hurts me inside. Now, you have to know your scoop. You have to know what that is and what your dose typically is. But that's pretty easy to measure once or twice and then you know that scoop is a eight gram scoop on the money when you do it right. This just pains me deeply. I hate the scoop. I want the scoop to go away. I want people to just spend \u00a310. \u00a310 pounds on a cheap set of digital scales, not have to think, not have to try, not have to pay attention and get exactly what they need to make their cup of coffee. To get exactly 15 grams every single morning, to remove a variable and set themselves up for a delicious cup without having to think or engage an uncaffeinated brain. Like that's the goal here. I don't want it to be complicated or fancy. I don't want scales to be some sort of barrier. I want them to help you, because I think scoops don't help you most of the time. They will produce a huge amount of variation if you don't use them with a lot of care and attention. And that's not something I have a ton of at six o'clock in the morning.", "videoID": "Umb2lhcxHHU"}, {"title": "The Barisieur - Do You Need A Fancy Bedside Coffee Maker\uff1f", "text": "Now tell me if this is a familiar problem, you wake up in the morning, you're warm, you're cozy, you're comfortable in your bed but there's a a problem. You want a cup of coffee. And this is where the indignity begins. I've gotta dress myself. I've gotta walk down the stairs. I've gotta go to the kitchen and make myself coffee. And that, frankly, is inconvenient. Now unlike me, maybe you're one of the lucky ones, maybe there's someone in your household willing, competent in making coffee. Thank you. But for the rest of us, there is hope. A company called Joy Resolve has built something called The Barisieur and it promises to be the solution to all of our problems. It is an alarm clock, it's a coffee maker, and it's got too many vowels. And I'll tell you all about it, but first I do need to make some coffee. I need to journal, meditate, maybe check my email. - And now a short ad for Morning Brew. - Now, one of the reasons I'm particularly interested in alarm clocks is that I don't really wanna wake up with my phone. That's just gonna pull me into social media and that's just not the way I wanna start the day. I want to wake up, have some coffee, and when I'm ready, sit down with Morning Brew. It's a free daily newsletter that covers everything you need to know in the world of tech, business and finance. One thing I really enjoy about it is the way that it's written. It's not dry and dull. It's fun, it's witty. It's so easy to read. And one thing I've really enjoyed recently was a great piece on the Anthony Bourdain deepfake in the new film Roadrunner. I've been really enjoying Morning Brew and I think you will too. It's free to sign up. It takes less than 15 seconds. Just click the link down in the description below to sign up for Morning Brew. So let's talk through The Barisieur and despite the spelling, despite that second extra I, this is actually how you say it. It's a coffee brewing alarm clock with some features. And I'll talk you through the coffee bit first, and then we'll talk about the kind of tech underneath. Now, the way it makes coffee is pleasing, but pretty simple. You put your cold water in here and at the appropriate time, it will boil it. But because you've got a stopper in the top here, that steam can't go anywhere. It drives the water then up the tube, along here, across into the shower head and then over the coffee. And it'll keep going until this clicks off and stops heating. And it kind of works a bit like a kettle base. Now it all comes to pieces relatively easily. And you know, this you can take off, fill it up with your correct water and bring it back. In terms of extras on the unit, this thing swivels, I suppose, for easier access for putting your coffee in that kinda stuff. And at the front here, you've got this. This is for putting your milk in because this unit actually has a little refrigerator around it to keep your milk cold until the morning. So you can wake up, put your milk in your coffee, if that's your thing and enjoy. And I suppose for convenience, the whole top part of this actually lifts off. You can take it away and I suppose reset your coffee setup. In terms of the rest of the thing, it's really pretty simple. You've got your alarm clock here. You got your time and you'd set an alarm in a pretty simple way. You do have a make button here that will let you make coffee whenever you want to. If you wanted to use this as a brewing device and then around on the side, here you've got your dial just to sort of set things, set the time, set your alarm time, that kind of stuff. Here is your kind of brew adjust dial. And this you can set to have it brew after your alarm goes off by 5, 10 or 15 minutes or before your alarm goes off by 5 minutes. I'm kinda surprised there isn't an earlier delay still because I would maybe want it to brew, cool down a little bit so that as I kind of come from the little death of sleep, I'm straight into a cup of coffee that I can drink and enjoy. But five minutes it is as a kind of pre-alarm brew setup, and then, you know, volume for the alarm. It's really a pretty simple thing overall. On the front, there is also this little drawer. You've got your little ground coffee bin, if you wanna use it for that and a little scoop, I'm not sure I would recommend either of those things. Capacity wise, you're brewing about 220 ml of water for this little cup of coffee. And that's the limit. Now, some of you, of a certain age, might find this extremely familiar. Let me show you what I mean. This is a Goblin Teasmade. Now this was very popular in the sixties and seventies. And as you might from the name didn't make coffee, it made tea. And it did it in an identical way. You had your alarm clock at the front, on the back here, a little kettle, the same mechanism drove the boiling water across into your tea pot, your tea steeped, you woke up and you had a cup of tea. Now your milk was a bit trickier then, you didn't have the nice refrigeration, but yet you had a cup of tea, you weren't complaining. But these things were not particularly expensive. Let's talk about the price for this thing. It's \u00a3350, which is quite a lot of money. Is it worth it? Well, I don't think I can say without putting it to the test and so, you know, come bed time, we'll get it all set up. And in the morning, I will awake to a delicious cup of hot coffee. - Sir, I'm going to retire for the evening. I've prepared some of the Rao recipe water you enjoyed the other day. And I have ground some of the lactofermented caturra as well. - Very good. - Have a nice evening. We've got coffee. Now, the problem is, even though I set that timer to be early, that's too hot to drink. Now, fortunately I thought ahead. I didn't want milk. I have my morning turmeric shot in here instead. Oh, why? So let's talk about the experience of this thing. The kind of weird thing to me is it doesn't start brewing earlier, right? Like I would want this to start brewing probably 10 minutes before I wake up, minimum, 'cause it takes about five minutes to brew and it seems a little bit redundant to have an alarm afterwards. It beeps five minutes before you start, you know, the alarm goes off, when it starts brewing and it's noisy. So you're gonna wake up. I don't have high, high hopes for the coffee because the way that it brews, I mean, that's not an ideal way of delivering water. It's just very much, here's all the water in one go. It really, really fills the cone. You've got like a big wall of coffee up the side. So I'm not anticipating the best cup of coffee of my life. It could be much better than it is. It's kind of disappointing in that regard. It's not something I would buy as a dedicated brewer it doesn't brew beautifully. I say it may not be the best cup of coffee in the world, that doesn't mean it's a bad cup of coffee at all. It's a good cup. It's just not outstanding and incredible just because of the way that it brewed. And you have to wonder who is this for, right? It's pretty much gonna be for the one coffee drinker in the bedroom, because if there's two of you in bed and just one of you has got this, that's just mean. Unless, you know, the other person doesn't drink coffee or something, or you're buying two and that \u00a3700 on alarm clocks that make coffee. 'Cause this is not a lot of coffee, right? Like that's a little cup of coffee to me. It's not like a big cup. I'm not sharing this with anybody. But if you are the kind of human, that cannot function without coffee, like you wake up and you are broken and you just need some sort of caffeine in the body. Then maybe, assuming you're the one coffee drinker in the bedroom and you have \u00a3350 to spend on a clock that makes okay coffee. So you're after someone who's desperate for coffee, but isn't too fussed about how good the coffee is. I dunno, and has a big budget. It's just for me, it's a kind of weird device. It does look nice. Like it is kind of fun. If you're not used to this kind of coffee-making, it is a fun little experience. It does look kind of cool. It feels well-made, it feel solid and robust. So I don't feel like, you know, it should be a quarter of the price. It feels well-made, it feels expensive. Now I'm not gonna keep this particular unit.", "videoID": "UALN1ZoN6bA"}, {"title": "The Best Coffee Toys Under $50", "text": "Today I'm gonna help you spend your money a little bit better. Because I get it, you get into a hobby, you get into coffee and you want all of the coffee toys. So today we're gonna look at a bunch of coffee toys, six different ones under $50, and see which of these are my favorites. And we're gonna start with this. This is the Tender Leaf, Babychino Maker, our most expensive thing today, cost us \u00a338, about $50. Let's have a little look at what you get for your money. So, a nicely made wooden toy build quality relatively nice here. In terms of extras with it, you get your little milk jug, not a practical steaming pitcher. So deductions there and a couple of cups, tasteful, nice, smiley, happy to see you. Got a couple of issues with the unit itself. Firstly, what is this? What is this here? It's not a steam wand. Did you just look at a coffee machine and think, \"It's got a thing at an angle on the side of it. Let's put one of those on\". So functionally useless. And then one of my bigger beefs the way that the whole thing works. So this is your portafilter, it's not real, that's not how- I mean it's like it's not how they work, it's not practical, it's not realistic, but whatever. And then I suppose this is supposed to be coffee, but why is it all of these different colors? I don't get it. So you meet your coffee and we go, got the clicky bird,  again, coffee machines don't have clicky birds. You could argue that's a flaw in coffee machines. But if you're trying to represent the world, it's confusing. Now what I do quite like is that you get biscuits. This one's eaten, this one. I don't understand that. You get little infills. I can pretend that I've poured a pretty good tulip! So points here for setting expectations appropriately of latte art. That's how this should be. But ultimately, this is a weird representation of a pod machine. It's quite expensive. I know it's wood and that's good, but, I'm not super impressed. Not sure it's worth \u00a338. Here's our next toy. And I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty excited about it. Ah. Look at this. Look at this. This is delightful. Look at the accuracy of the reproduction here. Only \u00a330. So you've got your portafilter. Much more realistic. It looks like a portafilter. It seems to sort of- Look at that. Look at that. Very good. Steam wand? Ooh, very loud. Oh, very loud indeed. But where's the steam wand gone? Look at this. Look at this. Even a little piece to hold it in case it gets hot. Always a concern. These buttons don't do anything. Little bit of a disappointment, but look at the drip tray. Look at that. Tremendous. I'm into it. I feel like this is an entertaining replica of an espresso machine. But it gets better. It gets better. It's a two in one. Turn it around. Welcome to my bakery. Would you like a piece of cake? Little cake with your coffee? Would you like it? Sorry. That just blows the previous one out of the water, doesn't it? Doesn't it say, \"Pods are bad in every way! You've gotta go with real espresso machines to have a good time\". I feel like that is good value for money at \u00a329.99. I feel like that's a good little toy. You could probably customize it if you wanted to, get some custom side panels done pretty easily. You know what I mean? Have some fun with it. Got plenty of space on your cup warmer for other cups. Should you have other cups that you want to use with this particular machine. Wood, again. Construction, not quite as hefty as the previous one but acceptably hefty, you know, sufficient heft. I like it. A recommended toy. Next up might be the best \u00a316.99 I've ever spent. Fisher Price, you've done it again. Look at this. Look at this set. It's a pour over set. The detail is very exciting. I do wanna say, I feel like it's got so much detail that I feel like it's an attack, actually on us, people who are weird about coffee. They know what they're doing. Look at this little kid on the back actually. Like, are people dressing their kids up like the old school hipster barista? Like is that a thing that they do? If you do, well, this is the set for you. Look at the bounty that we have here for our \u00a316.99. Now of course, that means most things are made out of plastic. You do have some wood accenting which is sort of nice, I guess. So first up, pouring kettle. Very nice, nice looking pouring kettle. Not the greatest spout, but it does. Oh, here we go. Accurate pouring liquid. So you can take your filter paper. Not the best cone, if I'm honest, but acceptable. And then come on, pouring my water. Pouring my water over my coffee. How exciting. Coffee grinder. Now I gotta say, it might be set a touch course looking at the pieces inside here. So deductions there. But it does make  sort of grinding noises. Now the upside of this, the real benefit of this is that no one likes hand grinding. Here's a training tool that you can soon fob off that job to your children. Get them excited about hand grounding with a toy and then give them the real thing when they're strong enough. Coffee beans, looking a little bit like chocolate covered raisins I'll be honest, potentially dangerous. Those are appealing. I'd like to try and eat one of those, as a small child. But yeah. Amazing. We do have, what I presume is like a cafe latte where you can swirl this. There's a little swirly bit. I'm not sure I'm delighted by the swirl if I'm honest. And then of course we've got a pour of a setup. Now, they've maybe cheaped out a little bit by giving me the pour of a paper, but no cone to put it in. You do have another swirly little number here squeaky this time. But ultimately, you've got a little grind. Heat your water, pour over, have a cup of coffee set. There's a little pastry bag here, I guess. The one detail I do like, if you're getting, sad bean, plus coffee, equals happy bean. It's true, Fisher Price. It's true. I've gotta say, for the money, it's a pretty good time. I'm into it. I think that's good value for money at \u00a316.99. And you know, a little bit of attack at me, at us at you, from Fisher Price. So well done. The joke has landed. Next up, Melissa and Doug with their K-cup machine toy, \u00a315.99, wood. So, you know, feels like good value. But already I'm a little bit annoyed 'cause let's not set the expectation that this is what coffee is at a young age. To encourage fine motor skills, fine motor skills you get a menu card. So you can, with a pencil, choose your strength of coffee, whether you want milk or sugar. You can choose if you want it iced or not. And then me, the child home barista. Are you a home barista with a K-cup machine? I don't think you are. Would then, you know, fill the order. So we'd have a light roast now, gotta say, doesn't do anything. Not a satisfying process I would say, like it's just, it's not coffee. That's not how you make coffee. Well, it is, but it's not. You can choose your desired beverage size on the side here. A lack of steps in the adjustment though. Can't tell if that's good or bad. And then your cup goes underneath, cup's a bit boring, plain white, a bit sensible. Only dairy milk actually. You could argue this is just for people who don't care about the environment you know what I mean? Like K-cups and dairy. Ooh, you're a bad child. No. Or a parent! Let's blame the parents. Either way. I don't like the idea that this is what we teach children coffee is and how it's made. I think this is a bad toy. It teaches bad habits. And so I cannot recommend Melissa and Doug's k-cup coffee maker, coffee maker type deal thing, that whatever this is called, they'll have stupid names. Next up. Confusingly, this is marketed as the Sanlebi Tea Set for kids but despite being called Cafe and Bakery. Now I'm not sure what's inside here for a couple of reasons. Firstly, could be blue, could be pink, could be blue. We don't know. Let's open it up. Look, I'm not into the plastic consumption but what tremendous value for money. Look at all of the things. Look at all of the things that you get for your \u00a317.99. Let's dive into the coffee pot of this first 'cause there's some delight to be ahead here. Firstly, you've got a Moka Pot, it does not unscrew but but you can- Look at the detail on that. Unnecessary. Fresh coffee from 1843, apparently. Alongside your Moka Pot, you do have some soluble coffee, which is confusing, not just because it looks like they've mixed the word \"coffee\" and \"caff\u00e8\" in Italian, into \"coff\u00e8\". Bit odd. But the instructions on the side for your 'preparazione' are in Italian. Sorry for my Italian pronunciation. This,  this is 'Funny Food Coffee, made in China'. We get, look at this, little classic coffee grinder. Ooh, it's clacky. Look, I thought I could see a burr moving but I can't. It's just a little clacker. I feel like this will last maybe 30 seconds to a full minute before breaking. Little drawer to dispense nothing 'cause it's not a grinder. But you've got a drawer. Which you could then take your scoop, little scoop and then you could fill, well, you can't open your Moka Pot, but you could pretend to scoop. I don't know anymore. If you do wanna learn more about scoops, We did make a video about that. It's up here. What I think is the greatest twist in all of this is the fact that these takeaway cups are actual takeaway cups. Like this is just a real paper cup. Only one of them has a lid, not a bad quality lid, gotta say. Probably not food safe. Let's enjoy the delicious afternoon. True words have never been spoken. And then a couple of cups, which we can modify again with a bit of latte art. Now, I'm not so into the snail look at it, here he is. I'm sure someone can actually now pour a snail. I feel like this is setting expectations. A very difficult place for a parent who might have an espresso machine at home. Your kids like, \"do a snail, dad\". You're like, \"no, I don't want to\". Or come on, do all of the hearts as an etching pattern or whatever this is. Look at this, look at all of this bakery. Now, it's cheap plastic. I'm not really into that, but, you know even if the child is not interested in coffee they might enjoy some bakery times. For the money, it does feel like pretty good value even if it all will break very quickly. I think the longevity of this stuff, pretty poor to be honest, hilarious. Perhaps one a grown-up may enjoy more than the child, but for me, difficult to recommend based on the build quality alone. Last one, this one, which I feel like it's kind of a weird toy, but we should talk about it. \u00a39.50 This is interesting that it's toy brand and then actual company brand. Like, Morphy Richards make real coffee machines. So they've clearly licensed the design, I guess. First up, it's very plastic. What do I expect? Is \u00a39.50. Secondly, color choices. I don't believe this toy was made in 1972, but the the sort of off white yellowy cream colored cups, what's happening here? I don't know. And the combo of colors here, again, doesn't feel, you know, like it will invoke childlike delight. It'll be like, \"Wow. Do you have any polyester flares I can wear, father?\" Look, the one reason I did wanna try this is that this one apparently can take water. I can put water in it. So if I get some water and put it in here You don't have to use custom mineralized water for the toy, but we are today. If I put this in the top, nothing's coming out. That seems like a win. I'm gonna close my lid. And then apparently if I put this underneath,  again, one more time and by the end of that, probably desperately need the bathroom just from listening to that sound. Headphones recommended. In terms of the rest of the toy, you've got a dial that does nothing does nothing like it's one- It feels like it's about to fall off, to be honest. The one trick of this is that it has a stopper, like a Clever brewer inside it. And that's it. I could then of course dispense some of my water into my cups, but I'm pretty sure this water's now no longer safe to drink. I'm not sure it's worth the \u00a39.50, I'm not sure it wouldn't just add clutter to your life and home. And so from that point of view, I would not recommend it. Cheers. Mm. Yeah, definitely wash the toy first. I've had some fun playing with these toys today and I think my recommendations are simple: For espresso requirements, this is the best of the toys that we tested. For filter coffee, really, Fisher Price, crushing it in that particular category. Now, as with all reviews on this channel, this is generally supported by my Patreon audience. These will be given away to my Patreon audience. They won't have to prove they have children. Don't worry about that. Because you might wanna enjoy this for yourself.", "videoID": "5OFt2T8aH9I"}, {"title": "Immersion Coffee Brewing Is Better Than Percolation", "text": "Today, we're gonna answer a question that I admit at first seems pretty ridiculous. Is immersion brewing better than percolation brewing? Is something like a French press, therefore better than something like a pour over. The reason I wanna do this is a few things have been bothering me at the back of my brain and I've gotta make sure I need to scratch. I've been thinking about immersion brewing quite a lot. And in recent videos, they've been times where immersion brews have been under extracted but it still tasted pretty good. So here's the really simple experiment. I'm gonna take a stock and quite common grinder. In this case, I have an EK 43 and I'm gonna set it at five different grind settings going from its coarsest setting all the way through to its very finest setting. We're then gonna take those five grind settings and brew a cup of coffee with each of these two methods with them. And at the end of that we'll do some extraction measurement. We'll see if one brew method performs better than another but more importantly at the end of all of that when they've cooled down, I'll do a big taste test. I'll line them up and I'll do a head-to-head at each ground setting to see which one comes out on top. I will acknowledge now that that taste test will not be a blind test 'cause I don't have anyone here to help me with that because of the way things are at the moment. But I still think it will be interesting for me to taste a comparison and go side by side. So let's begin. We're gonna grind 20 grams of coffee for each brew. I don't think we need to brew much more than that but brewing less than that I don't think necessarily would be fair or real world. To try and give you a little bit more insight. Here are the five different grind settings showed next to the KRUVE brewler, so the way it's gonna work is this, I'm gonna brew a French press using my French press technique that I'm very fond of. You can check a video up here, if you wanna see how to do that let it steep for four minutes. I'm gonna break the crust, scoop it off. And then I'm gonna pour relatively quickly after that because I'm not worried about sediment in this particular case, I'm worried about extraction. And later on, I'll obviously remove any sediment or suspended material from a sample that I'll do an extraction test with using a refractometer. As this deeps I'm gonna brew myself and I settled V 60. All alright, first round done, four to go. Okay 10 cups of coffee have been brewed. It took a reasonably long time but we're done, we're through it. It was kind of interesting everything at the coarser end of things, which is here the coarsest through to here at the finest brew very quickly as you'd expect. In the middle it kind of brewed quite normally at that sort of eight setting close to where I would be anyway. The moment we got to four things got muddy and soupy and weird. And by the time we were one that pour over looked super odd, it looked like there was some sort of channel potentially there. I don't really understand what I was seeing in that bed at the end of that, but it didn't look good. Now my original plan was to do the extraction measurements on these first, but I think I'm gonna taste them. I think I'm gonna taste them first to have as little bias as possible going in because I'm gonna have a bias knowing which one is which on each case. Now for you, the ones at the front here are the immersion brews and the ones at the back here are all of the percolation brews. Let's start at the coarsest end with these ones. I'll spare you the endless slipping noises having had a slurp, it's kind of interesting. So here at the very coarse end they're both obviously quite empty, quite hollow, quite weak. There's a slight kind of tanginess a slightly less pleasant acidity in the percolation and the poor over brew, than the immersion. Moving up just a little bit. There is definitely more textures of both of them. They do taste a bit stronger in both cases. The immersion brew does just taste a little bit sweeter. I don't know how else to describe it. Into the middle which is actually kind of where I'd probably grind for both of them. So I would expect peak quality here. Yeah, both are very pleasant, both very enjoyable here. They both have good qualities. The clarity that you get from paper filter is pleasant that extra texture here and kind of richness is also very pleasant. Going finer again though we see a big change. In both cases there's a slightly roastier characteristic to this coffee. This coffee is, I don't know it very well but it's sort of in the sort of medium range of things, I guess, for a filter coffee. So that roastiness it's kind of there for both of them. The difference is that the percolation brew the pour over has a pronounced kind of bitter attack to it that the immersion brew does not have. So there's a harshness and an astringency and a bitterness to this percolation brew that just tastes a lot less pleasant. It tastes ultimately like a much less even extraction at this point. And that's probably because we're starting to get some channels forming in that percolation brew. Things are starting to fall apart and then you get to that very fine setting. The coffee's lost a lot of its fruit here as an immersion brew. But again, it's not overly bitter. It's not particularly harsh. It's quite muddy. It's difficult to discern flavor but it's not unpleasant at all. It's really not that bad. The pour over though, very harsh, very bitter, no sweeteners, just really a lot less enjoyable. So every at the beginning I'm gonna call that one a draw, neither is victorious, particularly. Here, I don't really like to call it but I'd probably say maybe the immersion but it's pretty close. Here in the middle like for like I could not pick a winner. And then here by this point the immersion has pulled ahead, right? The immersion brew is notably more delicious than the percolation brew. And at the end here with that very fine grind, massive win to immersion brewing. The percolation is extremely unpleasant to drink. It is undrinkable, but I could drink. I wouldn't necessarily enjoy it but I could drink that immersion brew. So we'll do some actual measurement in a moment. Where we'll measure those extractions and see how they chart out compared to what I tasted. And then we'll also talk about what the real world implications of that might be. How does this experiment matter to you in the real world? And then we'll talk about why it might be this way. Why would immersion have this advantage over percolation? Why might it in these particular circumstances be a better brewing method? And we're gonna do that after quick ad from this video sponsor which is Morning Brew. We all know a great cup of coffee is a fantastic way to start the day but going down that social media rabbit hole or doom scrolling for an hour, maybe not so much. That is why I would recommend checking out Morning Brew. It's a daily newspaper, Monday through Saturday. Turns up in the morning, it's a five-minute read, but it is jam packed full of everything you need to know for the day, business, finance, tech. I really enjoy it. It's well-written, it's fun. It's easy to read. It's not dry and dull and it leaves you in a better place. Whether it's getting up to speed on the newly formed worker's union, within Google or a bit of a UI deep dive for Spotify's new group sessions there's always something super interesting in there that captures my attention. And the best thing about it is that it's free. It takes 15 seconds to sign up and then that's it. It's gonna turn up each morning and start your day off super well. Click the link down in the description below. And I say thank you to Morning Brew for sponsoring this video. So the measurement is done. All 10 samples have been measured. There were all stirred before a measurement was taken. And those that were from the French press were filtered again through paper to make sure that there was no suspended material to mess up our results. Now what's important about refractometer numbers is not to take them as absolutes. There are a number of other factors here that I don't really wanna get into. What we can look at, what is valuable are trends. With the immersion brews most of those numbers are in the kind of good extraction zone. Again, I don't wanna get too much into that but the way that they increase seems to make sense. The finer you grind the more extraction you see with an immersion brew and that's reasonably linear, not entirely but reasonably. And it sort of starts to top out as we get towards the threshold of what is easily extracted from coffee with the V 60 something very interesting happens. We see that increase in extraction each time and then suddenly it seems to plateau and then it falls back. And at the finest grind setting we saw the lowest extraction. What on earth is going on there? Surely that defies convention, but actually this is a phenomenon you see all the time in espresso. When you go to fine, you get channeling. Generally speaking if water can find a path of less resistance, a channel then more of that water will flow through that part of the bed. The coffee around that channel will have a lot of extraction because most of the water has flowed through it. And the rest of the coffee won't see as much extraction which is why on the whole, the bed is under extracted even though the taste was extremely bitter and unpleasant. And so it would be a fair argument to say across grind sizes, immersion brewing does a better job because it does, it does a better job because all of the coffee spent a good amount of time in contact with all of the brew water. With percolation the brew time is quite variable and it's determined by the size of the grind for the most part. Now, when it comes to coffee theory and extraction theory it's important to understand that very little water penetrates into the grind of the coffee. Mostly it's washing away what is on the surface of those grounds. That means your limit for extraction is set by your surface area. Immersion has the advantage of having all the time that you give it to do that extraction to whatever surface area is available. With percolation your contact time is determined by the grand size, by the resistance it gives to the water as it floats through. And so with a coarse grind your water doesn't get much contact time. And that's why it produces such inferior results. Typically, compared to immersion brewing. As you go finer it does get better. And we see that in terms of taste but then you hit a wall of fineness where you've gone to fine and the water is looking for channels, finding them, exploding them and your extraction goes down and your taste gets much, much, much worse. But what does this all mean for the real world? Well, one, it doesn't mean you should stop brewing with percolation brewers and only use immersion brewers. That's ridiculous. You can get incredible cups of coffee from percolation brewing. I love pour overs. I think they are delicious. This is not what I'm saying. If you are stuck with a grind that is not suited for your pour over method though brewing it with an immersion brew is likely to yield you better results. And this I think also explained the enduring popularity of something like the AeroPress. the AeroPress combines immersion brewing with percolation. You have this sort of steeping phase typically followed by some percolation. And I think giving a decent amount of time. And I generally prefer longer steeps in an AeroPress. I think for this reason, means that you're likely to have a pretty good infusion a pretty good immersion brew before you then go through an additional percolation phase.", "videoID": "09fNvoQMlGw"}, {"title": "Did Science Just Reinvent Espresso\uff1f", "text": "Welcome to a special episode of Weird Coffee Science, and it's special because it's got actual coffee science in it this time. Now, you might have noticed that the internet has lost its mind a little bit over a new paper published in \"The Matter Journal\". Now, you might've read it, but more likely, you've seen one of those ridiculous headlines where journalists try to just out dramatic each other for a title. Anyway, the actual paper is interesting, and the actual paper is definitely worth reading. It's titled \"Systematically Improving Espresso: \"Insights from Mathematical Modeling and Experiment\". Now, the title does give away the key things to understand here, and the first thing is modeling. So a group of scientists and mathematicians got together and created a mathematical model of how espresso extraction should work, and should is really the key thing here. Now, the maths involved is comfortably above my pay grade or comprehension, but I don't think you need to necessarily understand the maths, you just need to trust that the people doing it understand the maths involved. Now using this model, they could predict how something like extraction would change with grind setting, or how extraction might change if you change the constant pressure for the puck, and that's interesting. So they have their model of how espresso should work. Now, the model shows things that are pretty predictable. If you grind your coffee finer, you increase the surface area, and also you make it more difficult for the water to flow through. Therefore, for a constant pressure, you should see an increase in extraction the finer that you go. So far, so obvious, right? Makes total sense, but then they tested the model in the real world, and this is where things got interesting. Instead of seeing a constant increase in extraction as they went finer and finer and finer, instead, they saw extraction begin to decrease as you went finer and finer and finer. So at very fine grind settings, they had much lower extractions than they did at coarser grind settings, and this was a little unexpected. Now at this point, I needed a quick kind of caveat or side note on extraction in general. What they were able to do, and what many people can now do is take a cup of coffee and see how much of the soluble material from the grounds ended up in the cup of coffee, right? And from that, you can calculate a total extraction, and broadly speaking, extraction is linked to quality, but extraction is kind of the end result. It doesn't tell you how you got there. You would have a scenario, let's say, where you have very high extraction of a very small portion of the grounds, and a very low extraction of a lot of the grounds. Well, that might have a similar total strength in the cup of total extraction as a much more even extraction that's a little bit lower, right? So it tells you what you got, it tells you how much came out, but it doesn't tell you whether or not it was evenly extracted or unevenly extracted. Therefore, it's not a perfect indicator of quality. So back to the paper. That drop an extraction seems counter intuitive, but they did have an explanation. At very fine grinds, you're inevitably gonna get channeling. Water cannot pass evenly through that cake of coffee, and so some water, quite a lot of water, is going to flow through just a little bit of coffee where a channel formed. You'll have a very high flow rate through a channel, and the coffee around that channel won't see as much water. It won't be extracted as much, and this is causing this drop in total extraction. You've now got two competing factors in espresso brewing, right? You've got grind size, which determines, on the one hand, total surface area, and the finer you grind, the more coffee you should be able to extract, but the coarser you grind, the more evenly it's likely that the water will flow through the cake. And so what you're looking for is kind of a crossover point, a point that's the best of both where you're going as fine as possible for an even flow rate. so far, not so shocking. This just sounds like dialing in espresso, but it turns out that during the experiment, this crossover point was producing espresso brew times of between seven and 15 seconds, and this is considered an absolute no-no in the world of espresso brewing. No one would tell you you can get good espresso in 15 seconds. So I read the paper, hopefully like many of you, And I thought, okay, this sounds interesting, a little weird. I should replicate that. And so I could replicate a reasonable amount of what was in the paper. They were using a Mahlkonig EK43 grinder with coffee burrs. I had one of those lying around at Square Mile. They were, I think, we're using an Opera espresso machine, but they weren't doing anything particularly distinct to that machine's technology. They were just brewing at six bars, flat profile, and I had an espresso machine that I could put to six bars and that was fine. And the six bars is interesting and notable. Traditionally, we brew at about nine bars of pressure at the pump, and there's a couple of explanations for that. The first is the kind of myth version of it, which is that nine bars was considered to be the kind of average pressure of an old school lever shot. Not sure how true that is, but it's a nice story. The second version is that you tend to see a peak of flow at around nine bars. Below nine bars, if you're grinding very fine for espresso, the flow rate is a little bit lower because it's just less pressure pushing the water through. Above nine bars, your flow rate slows again, because you compress the cake so much that it's very hard for water to get through. And nine bars around about is a kind of peak of flow. In their testing, they had a lot of issues with nine bars, so they brewed at six bars, and actually coincidentally, six bars is what John from Decent Espresso recommends people to use if they don't have a high end espresso grinder If you've got a kind of beginner, medium espresso grinder, then then lower pressures will help not destroy the cake and create lots of channels. So I put my machine to six bars, very easily done, and we kept the brewing ratio initially from the paper, which was 20 grams of coffee in and 40 grams of coffee out. Now, I roped Gareth from Square Mile into this to be my co-conspirator and co-tester in this process, and we made a whole bunch of espresso, and we did what the paper suggests to do, right? You start a relatively fine grind, and you put 20 in, 40 out, and you time that shot, and then you go a little bit coarser, and you do the same thing. Now, ideally, you're gonna measure the extraction alongside tasting as you go through this process, and what you would expect to see, according to the paper, is that as you go coarser, your extraction increases a little bit, and then begins to decrease. At that peak of extraction is your kind of finest possible grind setting for even flow. Now, that grind setting that you find for peak flow for 20 in, 40 out, that may not taste good, okay? Don't worry about that. What you're supposed to do then is adjust your brew recipe. Either change your dose or change your output weight, change your ratios, basically to get the extraction that you want to reach, what I believe they call the Tasty Point. Now, I confess our sample size could have been bigger. We could have pulled definitely way more shots of espresso, but it seemed a bit redundant, because we could clearly replicate the results of their testing. We saw a peak of extraction at a kind of coarser grind setting than expected. It was like a 15 second shot at that point. It didn't taste great, but then we played around with the recipes, but undeniably, we saw this peak of flow, peak of extraction kind of thing happen. In the paper, I think that peak of flow is about 1.7 as a setting on the EK We were 1.8, 1.85, somewhere there. I don't think that really matters. I can't speak to the perfect alignment of our burrs, our coffee, all of those kinds of questions, but there was definitely a grind setting that produced higher extractions despite having a fast flow. There is more to talk about here, but before I do that, I do need to talk about the sponsor of this series, which is Squarespace. There are lots of different reasons to build a website. Maybe you want to share your passion project, maybe you want to share your hobby, maybe you need to set up an online store to sell the things that you've been building and creating. I would strongly recommend Squarespace. It's what I use, and I'll tell you why. It is incredibly easy to use. It's quick, and I can take one of their templates and very quickly adjust it, customize it, and make it look exactly how I want it to look. I'm sure like me, you want your digital presence to be as beautiful as possible, but maybe you don't have a massive budget to hire web designers, and frankly, you don't need to.

So we've replicated the results. This seems to be true. Is this a big deal? Is this flawless work? Do I have any criticisms? Well, maybe. So firstly, this is for them, one coffee, and I've done it with just one coffee. Now, they would argue that they've done other work on grind settings. I think the freezing paper in 2016 was a good example, and they saw that most of Arabica ground very similarly, and so they would argue that this protocol should work for any Arabica coffee, but that's definitely something worth testing and having more people experiment with and test. And secondly, they talk about flow through the cake as if it's either homogenous and even, or uneven. And if you use a decent espresso machine for any amount of time, you'll see that there's often a point in an espresso where it transitions from being more even to less even, right? It might be that the start of the shot is pretty even, but once a channel opens, then it stays pretty open, and your shot deteriorates pretty quickly. In the Decent, you'll often see on the screen for a fixed pressure, a reasonably fixed flow rate, and then a sudden increase in flow. That seems to be the point at which the kind of resistance of the cake has given up, channels have opened, it's falling apart, It's not providing the same level of resistance, and the longer you brew, the worse the shot will taste. With the Decent, you will definitely see a delay in that uptick of flow if your grinder is capable of more uniform grind settings, typically flat burrs do this better than conical burrs, but it's not an absolute rule. If your technique is better in terms of prepping the bed, you will have a more even flow for longer, seemingly. Now, I did put this point back to one of the lead authors on the paper, Dr. Chris Hendon, and he acknowledged that there may be a change in evenness, but he pushed back and said, just because you're seeing relatively stable flow, doesn't necessarily guarantee that that's coming from a truly even extraction, truly homogenous flow through the cake, and that's a fair point, too. Now, interestingly, the paper does touch on the real world application of this in cafes. In fact, they did some testing in a cafe in Portland that's kind of cool. So the recommendations of the benefits would be like this. If you're a cafe doing 20 grams in, 40 grams out in 28 to 30 seconds, that's not wildly unusual, that's pretty common, and there's an opportunity here, in theory. If you followed their protocols, you would have, one, much faster shots. You'd be brewing down at 15 seconds, literally half the time, which is just wild, but maybe interesting. And you would probably be having a lower dose of ground coffee, let's say 15 or 16 grounds, but a much higher extraction in that 40 grams of liquid out. You may end up actually with the same sort of amount of soluble material in a coffee cup than you would have done from the 20 to 40. If you extract 20%, let's say, of 20 grams of coffee, then you've got four grams of soluble material in an espresso to dilute it into milk, into a cappuccino, or a latte, or a flat white, or whatever, but we got about four grams of that puck is dissolved in the coffee liquid. If you took your dose down to say, 16, but you could get your extraction up to say 25%, that's a good bit higher, it's very high, but in theory, you'd have four grams of soluble material in that cup, and the taste may well be better or at least similar, certainly, in milk drinks. So you've cut your kind of usage dramatically. You would end up with, and this is where a lot of people sort of get a bit upset or less interested, you'd end up with weaker espresso, right? At 15 in, 40 out, even with a higher yield, that's going to be a more dilute espresso. Once you dilute that with milk, you couldn't tell, that's going to be irrelevant, but if you're a straight espresso drinker, you're gonna have shots eight, 9% strength and many people like thick, gooier espresso at the 10, 12, or even higher as a percentage of strength. Now, they do acknowledge the fact that these very fast flowing shots that are high extraction maybe lack a little bit of complexity compared to a more traditional espresso. They suggest actually blending different styles and ratios, which they admit is not hugely practical in a cafe, but might be in more industrial sort of espresso extraction. It's an interesting idea. I, in my tasting, the best shots that we had I thought were perfectly complex. I thought they tasted quite cleanly and clearly of the coffees in the blend. I didn't feel like they were lacking as espresso. They just didn't have incredible texture, but the texture was by no means bad. I think we were getting shots at sort of 9 1/2 percent strength, and those were very enjoyable. That does bring us back to one more thing, which is that they highlight repeatedly in the paper, a paper where they are measuring things, paying a lot of attention to things, having a very scientific approach, in all of these things, you need someone, a barista capable of tasting and tuning a recipe to produce the most delicious espresso possible. This is not a recipe for automation. This is not a recipe to remove the barista from the process. This is more about setting goals and targets that are measurable and tying that into the best tasting espresso that you can get. Let's summarize this whole thing. And first things first, if you haven't read the paper, please go and read the paper. I'll put a link in the description down below. You have my permission to skip the section covering the mathematical equations around modeling espresso, that's okay, but actually, the paper itself is written in very clear English. I think it's perfectly understandable to almost anyone who's willing to put the time in to read it carefully. I think it's a very well-written paper. Secondly, this is an experiment. This is one paper, this is one set of results. I have my own set of results, but I hope there will be more. The point of this, I think, is to start a conversation around this, around this idea, around this technique, and I think it will drive us to some interesting places. One, I think the importance of evenness of flow will become a bigger and bigger deal. We don't talk about that enough. We talk about even puck prep, but we're at the point where we can start to measure or pay attention to evenness in a host of different ways, and I think that will deeply improve espresso in a meaningful way. I think it's a big deal if we can do a better and better job of even extraction in espresso. If you're angry about this, if you're frustrated by this, if you feel that what they're doing does not apply to what you do, that's okay, but at least run some tests. Now, you're gonna need a decent grinder for this. Ideally, you're going to need something that is capable of reasonably uniform grind settings. I think if you're trying to replicate this with a blade grinder, you're not gonna have a great time, and you need to be systematic in this. You start fine and go a little coarser, and little coarser, a little coarser, a little coarser, and sort of see that sort of range and change in that kind of bell curve of extraction. I would like to test this on a host of other grinders. I just replicated what they did. I want to test it on a Mythos or a Mythos 2, or on some other espresso grinders that are out there, like even domestic espresso grinders. I want to try it with the Niche. There's a lot of testing to be done, and this is where you come into it. Please test this, please try this. Do some experiments, share your findings. To finish off properly, I'll share a few of my own thoughts from the test. One, I do like stronger tasting espresso. I really enjoyed the clarity and sweetness of these shots. I thought they were definitely interesting. The whole thing was very surprising, but there is still a case for stronger tasting espresso. While we saw more uniform flow at six bars at this coarser grind setting, looking at a naked pod filter, we did not achieve perfectly uniform flow. That cake still fell to pieces at some point, and maybe it's inevitable that this will happen. Ideally, there's 20 plus percent less puck than you started with. The whole thing is being washed away quite literally. That's the point of espresso. And so maybe it's impossible to achieve truly uniform espresso from start to finish? Did science just reinvent the espresso? Maybe, but I think there's something to think about, and there is definitely something to test before you dismiss this out of hand. Try it, it will surprise you, let me know your results.", "videoID": "BoYBLn9hRqs"}, {"title": "Caffenol\uff1a Developing Photos with Coffee and Vitamin C", "text": "There's a bunch of weird stuff on my desk and that's because today we're gonna develop some photographs with coffee Let me give you the backstory about how we got here I recently got into old school film photography I wanted a hobby that was slow that was difficult That had no instant gratification that had gratification that you really had to work for when I told the Internet this The Internet very excitedly said you have to do a video on caffenol what is caffenol? Caffenol is a developing mixture a concoction of chemicals that you use to bring the image out of photographic film Its history goes back to 1995. It was invented basically by Dr Scott Williams in his class at the Rochester Institute of Technology. It's popular today because it's a really cheap alternative to traditional darkroom chemicals It's made of stuff Lying around your house for the most part and if you're willing to put the work in, it's a much cheaper way To develop your film at home. That isn't what appealed about it to me I just really liked the idea of developing film with coffee So you're probably wondering how does coffee work as a film developer? Now coffee has a host of different compounds in it We know that already but only one of them is of particular interest. It's called caffeic acid Has nothing to do with caffeine its present in other things than coffee But it is a phenol and its present in lighter roasted coffees It does degrade in the roasting process and this acts on the silver halide in black-and-white film. That's really cool now most people who use caffenol are doing so because it's cheap and therefore they're using Instant coffee. Instant is very cheap. Especially cheaper ones are often pretty light roasted. That's how it's confusing But trust me, that's true. And so they're likely to have plenty of caffeic acid in them I don't want to use instant coffee though. That seems like no fun That's not who I am on what I do and also that would be too easy I want to make my life a little bit harder for this particular experience. So instant is out We're going to be using proper fresh coffee pretty light roasted. So I shouldn't have any issues and we'll talk about how I'm gonna Re-engineer the typical caffeine or recipe in just a second. You do need a couple of other things you need vitamin C ascorbic acid - those of us that care about names it also acts as a developing agent But it's a really slow acting one but together with the caffeic acid. You have a quicker developer They work in conjunction that way this Suspicious-looking white material is actually sodium carbonate that's different to sodium bicarbonate sodium carbonate is often sold as washing soda Or soda ash. I didn't have any sodium carbonate at home I had a load of sodium bicarbonate turns out if you put that in the oven and Essentially roast it for a while. It degrades into sodium carbonate. So that's what we've got here I've made my life again a little trickier. I've brought some potassium bromide to the game This is common in some recipes where people want to reduce the incidence of fogging in their developing. And so that's what that's for I think you can use some ayodhya salts instead But I wanted to stick with the original if I'm gonna mess with other things here now There are loads of different caffenol recipes online I picked one I decided that was a good kind of middle of the ground version here It is laid out to make about a litre of developer now I'm going to be making a little bit less because I don't need a full litre I'm only developing one roll of film in this little tank turns out if you get into photography just before a pandemic Expect to have to learn to develop your own film at home because all the photo labs are shut So thankfully I already had all of the toys here all the things necessary for that So this is called a Patterson tank It lets you pour liquids in and out without exposing the contents to light and then you need an exposed roll of film This is medium format film which is why it looks so funny and you only get about ten photos on a single roll of film So you can see why people would want to make the whole process as cheap as possible when the film ends up being as Expensive as it is. The upside of this kind of film is that you have a very large negative that captures a ton of detail If you use it, right and like I said, I am a rank amateur here I know very little I'm just learning It's really early in my journey But I thought it would be a fun little experiment for you and me first of all I need to get this film from the reel into the tank and that Is what this is for this is a dark bag I could put my hands And I can do everything inside a bag and no light can get to it what you need to do is get the film out of this reel thread it onto this reel put it into the tank or Inside a bag we can't see what's going on. I presume people who do this all the time. It's really easy for them I don't know what I'm about to film myself doing something I'm so terrible at. it'll probably be just a few seconds of me gurning and eventually me being a little bit happy that it worked Out and then we're gonna have to mix up our solution and generally you mix caffenol right before you use it You don't make it ahead of time too much because it does I think it degrade quite quickly and become less and less useful Just to walk you through the process of recreating caffenol with fresh coffee Firstly we take our 1 litre recipe and we scale it down to 750. So I know that I need 30 grams of dissolved soluble material in there somewhere What I'm going to do for that is basically pull a bunch of espresso This will be much stronger than I need so I'll be diluting it down later if I pull 20 grams in and 50 grams out I'm going to get a pretty good extraction without compromising strength too much. Now, I'm gonna pull nine doubles nine doubles of 20 So I'm gonna use a hundred and eighty grams of coffee. Now if I've done a good job and extracted 20% of that I've actually got 36 grams of soluble material. I'm gonna go for a little bit of excess here That's okay. Now before I can actually use that What I will have to do is filter it this is going to be combined with photographic film I don't want bits of stuff floating around in my developer. I don't want any tiny fines I don't want any oils none of that stuff So after I've pulled the espresso I will have to filter it and there will be some losses to the filter paper I'm probably in a double filter it for the sort of safety Initially through two AeroPress filters to get rid of the most of the stuff and then one more probably v60 filter just to clean It up as much as possible At the end of that. I hope to have between 400 and 450 mils very strong coffee I expect it to be somewhere in the ballpark of like 8% If I know how much liquid I've got and I know how strong it is That's what these refractometers are for then. I know how much soluble material is in my jug of coffee From that point I can then dose the necessary amount out. I can then add my other materials I can add my ascorbic acid My carbonate might potassium bromide having mixed those into some distilled water first to make up the rest of the recipe Mix that all together make sure it's room temperature about 20 degrees Celsius and we should be good to go the next time you see this tank after it's loaded is When I'll be pulling the film out of it for the first time to see if my calculations Were right That's either going to be deeply disappointing or wildly satisfying. Let's load some film into the tank To hate this bit one roll of film in the bag zip it up I dreamed of being competent at this particular part of the process Success. Alright, let's go and make some caffenol Here it is, I don't know if this has worked this is my first time seeing it You can't cheat this bit. I don't know something wrong. I don't know if I messed something up or not maybe oh Oh, yeah, I See images definitely messed up some exposures here. All right, I don't actually know how these are turned out This image is on them, which is very exciting. I'm gonna hang these to dry and Then I'm also going to talk about a couple other things that are important Firstly like every video right now has an ad in it. This video has a giveaway I will pick ten people who enter the competition down below anywhere in the world if you need coffee, and you can't afford coffee right now whatever the reason. Enter below I'll pick ten people send them coffee anywhere in the world that I'm able to send them and Hopefully make someone's day a little bit better and I do these little giveaways anytime there's an ad in the video and it makes me very happy to say that this video is sponsored by Audible. Audible is the leading provider of spoken word entertainment and audiobooks for me Audiobooks fit really well in those little pieces of my life. There's little gaps It turns a commute that might be boring or frustrating into a moment of learning or a moment of entertainment recently I've particularly enjoyed Michael Pollan's audiobook Caffeine I think anyone who drinks coffee should probably listen to this not just because it's interesting but also Because it makes you think again about the way that we drink a coffee though. I'll be honest. I'm not stopping anytime soon They've also just launched stories.audible.com a website.

That's probably more true. If you use cheap instant coffee, it didn't smell good But I wasn't truly horrified by the smell. I mean it was pretty bad, but it was not Life-changingly awful. It was just a bit gross secondly This was a very expensive way to do a cheap thing working out the cost involved It is actually cheaper to have a lab develop your film than to use high quality fresh coffee to do it yourself, though It was just super interesting to see if I could get it to work until I get those negatives in the scanner I don't really know what kind of a job I've done. It's definitely exciting I gotta say the moment that you pull a developed roll of film a roll that you shoot yourself Develops yourself the moment you pull that out of a tank and see a negative is one of the most satisfying things So I guess now we should cut to Me shooting some photos and I'll drop the photos on top as is tradition for YouTube photography videos Thank you very much to the Square Mile team for their patience and letting me you know, photograph them while they were working So I'm in square-mile spitting a noisy. Sorry about the sound on this one We're gonna shoot some pictures today and I'm going to develop those in the coffee that we're gonna be photographing being roasted today Should be interesting. I'm gonna shooting on this which is a Mamiya RB 67 Pro S I picked it up from eBay a little while ago. It's a medium format camera. I love it now We're gonna be shooting Ilford HP5 at bog speed Which is a thing that people say come to realize that an important part of people Making videos about film photography is that you've got to watch them load the film but they've got to skip the bit that's actually tricky Easy right. We're ready to go.", "videoID": "9bhOtTUtPhg"}, {"title": "The Truth About Paper Cups", "text": "I'm sure that you, like me, would like to do more for the environment; would like to have a lower environmental impact. So you might have wondered: \"Well should I be using paper cups?\" It's a good question, and it's one that we're going to look at in a bit more detail. The paper cup has become something of an icon of the coffee industry, and when the Americanized version of Italian coffee culture spread around the world and coffee shops became more like fast-food restaurants, coffee on-the-go really flourished. The old Italian model was really about taking time out of your day and going and having a coffee; taking a break. But now it was all about coffee anytime, anywhere. More than that paper Cups are what allowed this new style of coffee to become financially viable Coffee shops couldn't survive if they just sold coffee to people sitting inside Over time cups became expressions of brand and the cup that you held in your hand said something about who you were There is however a problem These cups produce a staggering amount of waste tens of thousands of tons What's confusing is that it seems like they can be recycled some cups even say so But if you put one into a recycling, bin you pretty much consign it to landfill.", "videoID": "vFXznoNqRfo"}, {"title": "The Best Cheap Manual Coffee Grinder", "text": "Today we're gonna find out which is the best, dirt cheap, hand grinder. What do we have here? Well, I went out, I went to Amazon, as you do, and I bought five hand grinders, and I thought they were a nice spread of what's available right now. So we have the Rhino Coffee Gear, little hand grinder, we have the Porlex Mini, we've got the classic, probably the bestselling cheap hand grinder of all time, which is the Hario Slim. On Amazon, the top search came out for the Henry Charles hand grinder. Never heard of that, no idea what that was, so I picked that up, and then I also went and saw what was very popular in the US, which is the JavaPresse. Pressay? Presse? Presse. And I picked up one of those as well. What I'm gonna do is break them down into various categories and award them scores, and at end wrap up into what I would give as my recommendation of the best, cheap hand grinder out there. The sensible place to start would be price, and there's some funny prices here, but that's Amazon for you. So the Rhino Coffee Gear was 31 pounds and 64 pence. The Porlex, relatively expensive at 57 pounds. Now I already owned this Hario Slim, this is mine, but it would cost 28 pounds and 89 pence. The, what is it, Henry Charles thing, is 25,99, and the JavaPresse, we're gonna call it the JavaPresse, that is 70 pounds in the UK. Now here's an important thing I have to talk about right off the bat. I bought these knowing they looked similar, but having had them turn up, they really do appear completely identical. I suspect they're gonna do very similarly in testing. So a little bit frustrating that they are so similar, that they are basically the same. I suspect exactly the same factory put these out, with just two different brands on them. But that's what we've got. That's what we're testing today. And we're gonna take the best one of these forwards into the next review of hand grinders, which is the ultimate hand grinder. Which is the very best hand grinder that money can buy? And we'll see how a cheap grinder stacks up against the best in the world. Points-wise, more points for cheaper, in this situation. So I think it would be five, four, three, two and one point over here. Let's move into the next, and one of the most important categories for me, which is build quality. So starting with the Rhino Coffee Gear, it is well-intentioned, but I will say a little bit sloppy in its execution, in its build. Just feels a little cheap. And they've done things that are nice, like instead of just having the stainless steel slide onto another piece of stainless steel, there are these little plastic insert points here, so this should fit nice and snugly. However, down at the bottom here, this feels loose. It doesn't feel like it's a particularly good fit. I know you're supposed to grip at the top, but it feels very easy to split the grinder when you're holding it, and that just doesn't feel fantastic. Stainless steel, as most of them are. Nice little rubber band. But just a little bit sloppy. And so onto the Porlex, which is pretty well-built, to be honest. Everything fits quite nicely. This is stainless steel onto stainless steel, but the parts fit well. Same with the base. It feels secure. It goes in deep enough that it doesn't feel like it's gonna move around. Overall, yeah, pretty well built. Now, the Hario is unusual here because it is a plastic construction. For better or worse, is different to the approach of the others. It means this chamber is all see-through. This is a robust plastic. I've traveled with these all around the world. I don't particularly worry about damaging it, but does it feel as nice as stainless steel? Well actually to me, it kind of does. Now if you really prefer stainless steel, that's fine. There's nothing particularly premium to me about that kind of brushed stainless steel, and there's nothing particularly premium about this kind of plastic. It's well-built, it all fits together neatly. This screws into place, I suppose, which is a nice aspect, instead of sliding or clicking on. It's much more secure in its build. But it's plastic. Now the Henry Charles, well, it's okay. It's not bad. It's light. It's not a particularly, it doesn't feel particularly strong. There's a little plastic insert here. I don't really know why, I don't know why you'd put a window there, but we'll talk about that when it comes to usability. Overall, yeah, entirely fine. It doesn't feel expensive. It doesn't feel like a particularly thick gauge. This, little slidey. I can't imagine it falling off, but it's not secure in that regard, and to be honest, the JavaPresse is identical in every single way. So for that round I'll award the Porlex five points, the Hario Slim four, the two identical, the Henry Charles and the JavaPresse, I'll give them both three points, and the Rhino Gear, I thought, was just the sloppiest build so I'll give that two. One of the main reasons people buy these things is to travel with them. I certainly had one in my luggage as I've traveled around the world, and stayed in Airbnbs, and just wanted to make some coffee in the morning. So how do they all do for portability? And so, bringing them all back for a second, well, we need to talk about size. Now this thing, the Rhinowares is the biggest, which is probably the least desirable in a portable grinder, and the Porlex is by far the smallest. Now the neat thing about the Porlex is that the rubber band comes with a place for you to store your crank handle, because otherwise that's just gonna float around freely, as it would do with every other grinder. There's nowhere to put these when you take them off. You need to take them off for traveling. So that's a bit frustrating. This rubber band is a nice, little detail on the Porlex that really ups its portability. Again, plastic construction means I worry a lot less, throwing this thing in a bag, about what not only is hitting it, but what it might be hitting. I don't really worry about damage that way, or I might worry a little bit more about throwing something stainless steel into a bag with other potentially fragile things. I'm a sloppy and hurried packer of things. I'll admit it. These two, yeah, fine. Perfectly portable. Somewhere in the middle. So, probably the most points again are five for the Porlex, I'd go a four for the Slim, three points apiece here, and again, just two points to our friend the Rhino coffee grinder. For the next part of testing we're gonna do the obvious thing. We're gonna grind. We're gonna brew some coffee. This will let us do both usability testing, how do they feel to use, as well as taste testing, at the end of that. We're gonna grind at two different settings. We're gonna grind firstly to brew a 20 to 330-style pour-over. And I'm gonna go a little finer and aim for a faster brew time. There's always an issue with uniformity in hand grinder, especially cheap hand grinders, and going a little finer and faster, by and large, for me is a better way to get a better tasting brew than going coarser and dealing with the much, much, much larger pieces that come with that. However, I do wanna grind a bit coarser to see at what point the grind distribution falls to pieces. So now let's grind a lot of coffee. So we brewed five cups of coffee and in that time it's given me a chance to get my head around these grinders a little bit more from a usability perspective, and there's a few things I want to talk about. So let's start at the beginning with the Rhino. It's hopper holds around 30 grams of coffee, which isn't the biggest of them. It's actually the second smallest of them. The smallest actually is the Porlex, which held only about 25 grams, which actually might be an issue for me. Now I would brew when traveling up to a 1/2 liter batch, so 30 grams to every 500. This would frustrate me at 25, which is really where it topped out. However, it felt very nice to use. The handles on all of them were fine. The Hario holds up to about 40 grams of coffee in the top hopper, and actually the shape with the wider top, makes it much, much, much easier to fill, which is a bonus. However, when you are grinding, it can feel like the beans inside are sloshing around in there, and you're just worrying that the beans aren't funneling down the way that they would do with slimmer grinders. There wasn't a massive issue in grind time, though I got stuck a few more times with the Hario. That was interesting to me. These two here, may as well talk about them as if they're one. They both hold about 40 grams too. Shape, style, fine. Now, the bottom of these has the little window. I have no idea why you would put a window in. I get that with plastic, it's plastic. I can just see in, and that's nice. Why would I not make it see-through if it's plastic? But here, adding in another piece actually is kind of annoying. One, because I don't need to see how much coffee's in there or if there's coffee in there. I'm gonna put all the coffee I need in the top, grind it and then use it. So I don't get the point of a window. But the way that it's constructed, one, you've got another breakable. Two, something that's a little bit harder to clean. I'd rather everything be stainless steel, if it's gonna be stainless steel or everything be plastic, if it's plastic. But also the way that it's mounted inside the stainless steel. There's this ridge around the edge, and coffee was getting stuck in that little ridge, fines would accumulate there. So, all in all I did not like the construction inside of that thing. When you look at them, it looks like they're all using an identical burrs head. The burrs look very, very similar in terms of their teeth configuration, their cutting edges. The Hario's is a different color. The rest of them are these white, ceramic ones. This is a grayish, darker ceramic color. They all are stepped. They all have clicky adjustments. However, the Rhino's steps were much smaller, so you could be more precise with this one. The rest of them were really pretty similar. And then I brewed them. So like I said, 20 grams to about three, three, three of water in the top, so 60 grams per liter, as a ratio. All of them brewed and drew down in a very similar time. The Hario was a little bit quicker, which was interesting 'cause I'd wondered if I was grinding finer on it, because I got caught a few more times. I got a little bit stuck grinding a couple more times on the Hario. I wondered if that was 'cause I was going finer, but actually it drew down five or 10 seconds quicker. These have all been sitting, cooling down, getting ready for me to taste. And I'm gonna be tasting for a couple of things. Obviously, I want it to be good, the coffee that's coming out of these things, but I'm really considering uniformity of grounds, and so an uneven extraction from very different particle sizes would manifest in both unpleasant bitterness as well as unpleasant sourness. So the very tiny pieces you might get would contribute in terms of bitterness, the very coarse, bouldery pieces will make the brew taste extra sour. They all brewed in a very similar time, as I said, so we should have relatively matching cups. Same bloom, same total pour time. All of those kind of things were consistent. So, now it's time to taste. Hmm. Hmm. So I'll say now the range between the best and the worst isn't huge. Not shocking 'cause the price range isn't particularly wide in these things, but the worst to the best, not an enormous gap. All of these coffees are okay. Nothing is wow! Nothing is undrinkably terrible or hugely problematic. These have a sort of souriness from, you know, it tastes like there're a few more bigger pieces that didn't really play the game as much. This is just a little weaker, just a little less extracted than the others, so it would stand to reason that I was maybe a touch coarser than I thought I was on this. It doesn't have that, a bunch of it was okay and then a bunch of it was really coarse. It has, everything was just a little coarse, and fining it up would make it okay. Make a good, decent cup of coffee. These are the best two cups for me. I'm aware that tasting in this manner is deeply, deeply unscientific and not particularly good, especially when they taste as close as they do. They're really, really very, very similar cups. I might say this and then you could switch the cups around and I might say that. Really not much in it. Both decent, quite sweet. Not too much sourness. Really not too much bitterness either. Does it compare to an EK43? Does it compare to even the Wilfa Uniform? No. You can definitely tell there's a spread of particle sizes. That is somewhat inevitable with cheaper hand grinders. This is where the better coffees were. This was sort of in the middle, and then this, these two, this grinder, they're kind of the same thing, right, was the least tasty of them for me. I would be happy to travel with these. I've certainly happy to travel with this, or have been in the past. These, whoa. Not quite as much. So let's award maximum points, medium points, less points over here. It's summary time. So on paper the Porlex wins it. On build, on portability, on grind quality. But, that capacity, it might be a sticking point for me, and someone else watching this. It just might be a little too small. The Rhinoware I liked a lot, the better grind control, the good quality of grinds for the price. Yeah, it's a good little grinder. Again, not huge capacity, but good. Little bit cheaper, the Hario. It's the middle-of-the-road all-rounder. There's a reason this is so incredibly popular. I actually like the plastic construction. There's advantages to the shape. For the money, it grinds pretty well. It's not a surprising, popular choice. These two here, if it's at this price, if it's 25,99, and I think in the US it is much cheaper for the JavaPresse, then it's just, you getting what you pay for. It's not very good. It has a bunch of frustrations for me, in terms of the build. It didn't produce great-tasting coffee. I'm not an enormous fan of this. I probably wouldn't recommend these. I think there are better options at a cheaper, or a higher, price. So on paper, probably the Porlex takes it. Little bit more thoughtful, but certainly a little bit more expensive. But I will say that at this kind of price point, there just aren't enormous differences in the quality of grind that you're getting, so you may want to consider some other factors. These were bought thanks to the support of my Patreon. If you want to be involved, I'd love to see you there. The support means I can go and buy these products, not have to rely on manufacturers, and I can tell the truth. I can tell you what I like and what I don't. All of these will be given away now, including the one that I bought myself some time ago, but I'll give it away too. These are gonna go to Patreon backers, who've entered a little competition, and they'll be getting an email from me very soon, letting them know who's won, and little packages of delight, including these grinders, will be going in the mail to them. What we'll do is we will take the Porlex forwards to the next round, and the next round is gonna be the ultimate hand grinder showdown. Budget's irrelevant here.", "videoID": "QLEBfom0mhM"}, {"title": "Review\uff1a Kruve EQ Glassware", "text": "Today we're gonna review these, It's the new glassware from Kruve. Now you may remember Kruve from their sifter, their kind of coffee grounds focused set of sieves, that I think was one of the first things that I reviewed on this channel. Well, this time they went to crowdfunding and I backed it, I think it was either Indiegogo or Kickstarter and they have produced these, these two tasting glasses as well as a carafe that I think is pretty great actually. The carafe, you could put like a V60 on top, or like a Kalita, a Melitta, a Clever, probably not narrow press. But you could obviously just bruin something else and decant, if you're feeling fancy, we'll come back to you in a second. Now, the two glasses, there's two different shapes that are in many ways the same shape, actually. So if you turn one of them upside down the shapes are actually identical, but not. So, I don't know if this was about, maybe you'd like molds or I don't really know how you make glass. I don't know if this was a convenience or a stylistic decision. They are dual-walled, which is mostly good. Now I don't like most dual-walled glassware 'cause it keeps coffee way too hot. Here you've got kind of a dual-walled section that you hold and then inside it, this sort of insert with a single-walled section that you drink from which is nice. I definitely like drinking from single-walled much more than I like drinking from double-walled. And the shapes are there to sort of enhance certain aspects of your coffee tasting, right? That's the idea behind the name EQ. You can sort of add some meed's or some base, I guess to it, that's the kind of idea. There's two things to talk about here as a review. One, do they work? And two, do you like them? Do I like them? Do they look good? Then we can start with the first one 'cause it's kind of easier. Now, the sort of science around tasting and the influence of glassware is actually pretty solid. And I think the thing that you'll notice the clearest is probably the sort of width of the rim at the drinking point, right? Like that kind of directs the coffee in this case onto the tongue, and actually the wider the rim, in this case this one here, the more of your tongue it will hit. And this tends to enhance the kind of mouth feel of the coffee that you're drinking. Something a little narrower, you get a more direct linear, leaner, kind of feeling from that kind of coffee 'cause it's directing it just down the middle of the tongue. And actually despite the fact that you feel like it shouldn't, it does have quite a big impact on how you perceive the texture, the body, the mouth feel of the coffee, which is interesting. And this is definitely well-researched, you see this in wine glasses unquestionably. Now, they do also make a couple of other claims. One is on headspace. Obviously the headspace in these is a little different, this is much wider. In theory, you could argue, this is a bigger headspace, it would trap more aromatics, whereas this is narrower. But I guess you could argue that this is therefore more condensed, I don't know. In my tests, I didn't really notice a huge difference in aroma between the two glasses and day to day if I'm just drinking coffee, I don't really spend that much time just sniffing my cup, that's kind of a bit weird. It's not a part of it, I'm just drinking, enjoying, thinking about that. They do also say one thing that the sort of open area changes the oxidation of the coffee which changes the acidity, which is new to me. I would imagine that just the act of drinking, the agitation of moving the glass backwards and forwards would be enough to introduce lots of fresh oxygen into the glass. So I can't imagine you'd really have a substantial difference in oxidation and I'm not sure I'll ever want much oxidation. Anyway, that's kind of that. Now, before we go any further I should probably just put some coffee in these. And this is a Kenyan coffee and I would imagine in this it's gonna be a little leaner, a little brighter, a little kind of crisper, whereas in this, it might enhance that kind of juicy, fuller aspect of the coffee as it spreads more coffee over my tongue. You know, you could argue that there's some confirmation bias going on here but I don't really worry about that. They unquestionably feel quite different to me. They kind of taste quite different. My brain is thinking about them in kind of a different way. And honestly, given the choice, I'd probably drink out of this one a lot more than this one, 'cause I like that kind of rounder, fuller feeling with coffees, but it is just kind of fun, you do you. Now, that brings us to the other part of this which is how do I feel about how they look? And I feel a bunch of ways about this. If a random family member walked into the kitchen and found me stood, drinking out of this, there'd be some explaining to do. They're definitely quite unusual. I would worry that you would feel a touch pretentious drinking out of something like this. Style-wise, they're kind of weird, they are, I don't know, I'm kind of torn on this one. They've got like a little bit of googie architecture sort of vibes about them. Someone mentioned the Jetsons and I thought that was a super good call. It feels a little bit like something that they might have for an extra on set in the background of a Star Trek movie when they go to a bar. It's good, kind of a retro-futuristic vibe to me, and if you like that, that's cool, if you don't like that, I guess that's cool too. Now they come as a set of two like this, so you get one of each. A little bit awkward if you share coffee with someone on the day to day and you both like the same glass that might get a bit awkward. And they are of course glass which means they are much more breakable than something like ceramic, I would definitely worry about that. I love Zalto glassware for wine and having broken one or two of those, you get a bit weird about them and you suddenly stop using them as much. So, I would imagine at $25 a glass, you break one, the other kind of goes away for special occasions, that would be a thought at the back of my brain. But some people really like how these looks, some people really don't, that's up to you. Do they work? Yeah, they do. You can have a little bit more of what you like about a coffee and I think that's kind of cool. I will say, just going back to the carafe, I think this is beautiful. I think on all the glass wares, they've done a cute thing which is print inside the double-wall with the kind of crude of an EQ logo. I think that's a really lovely touch. I think that the carafe is very pretty, it doesn't have a ton of space for swirling, I'm not sure I'd actually use it for a wine decanter or something like that, but as a way to serve coffee, that looks, I think lovely. I'm pretty into the decanter. Now I backed these actually out of my own money before Patreon was a thing in my life. It was a good while ago when this started but for no real reason, Kruve have sent me extra. So I have two sets of these glasses to give away. I'm giving it away on my Patreon. So thank you to Kruve for giving me those and I hope they find a happy home.", "videoID": "RVBxeB4VbLY"}, {"title": "The Ultimate Moka Pot Technique (Episode #3)", "text": "Today we're talking about the moka pot. This is The Ultimate Moka Pot Technique, and this is going to be a little bit different to my other Ultimate Technique videos, because, well, there is no one moka pot. They go from being great big things down to being nice and little and small, there's different styles, but they all kind of work the same way. But it's a versatile brewer, it's a tricky brewer, and what I'm going to do today is give you some constants, a few things that I would do for every single brew, and then a few variables to tweak to get the best out of each of these brews. If you watch this and just do the constants, I think you'll get a better brew, but I would recommend taking the time to understand how to get the very best you can from the moka pot. Let's begin, though, with a very quick explanation of how a moka pot works. For this we took a moka pot like this and sliced it in half, and you can see there's really three chambers to pay attention to. The lowest chamber is your boiler. You put your water in here and as you boil the whole unit, once it's sealed together, the steam and expanding air will press the water up the funnel through into the middle section which is where the coffee sits. And that pressure built by the steam and built by the expanding air will press the very hot water through the coffee into this chamber, filter it out, and then push the liquid up here and into our collection receptacle in the top from which we can then pour and drink. It's a beautifully simple brewer. It's kind of fun that it kinda brews upside down; instead of water on top, coffee and then drink at the bottom, it goes the other way. The big challenge with a moka pot is preventing the whole thing getting too hot and having incredibly hot water from the boiler pass through the coffee, which tends to give a great deal of bitterness to a cup. That's what we want to avoid. So now I'll take a classic pot, this is a six-cup aluminum Bialetti, and I'll walk you through the constants first and then we'll brew with it afterwards to go through the variables in a bit more detail. First constant is put boiling water in the base of this unit. Putting boiling water in the base of this thing brings the temperature down to the kind of low 90s, which is perfect for putting on the heat and starting to brew with. You can, if you want to, boil your water in the base first, but do let it cool down a little bit. I wouldn't recommend starting with the water super close to boiling point. Starting with freshly boiled water in the base means you have a faster brew, more suitable brew temperatures, And I know that sounds surprising, but trust me, it works better this way, and you'll get a better extracted, more delicious cup of coffee. Constant number two, you want a full basket of coffee. Now most of these brewers work on approximately a 10 to 1 ratio. If you fill the water on a boiler to just below the valve, typically it will hold around 10 times more water by weight than you can fit coffee in the basket. Bear in mind though that filling the basket is a volumetric fill and a light roast will weigh more than a dark roast will. So it's difficult to say you must use exactly 10 to 1, but I tend to recommend that as a good starting point. This holds just under 300 grams of liquid in the base, but I'm still gonna aim for about 30 grams of coffee into here, ground freshly, right before we brew. Next up is puck prep, and consider this an optional extra. I think it does help make the coffee taste better, but don't freak out if this isn't an option for you. Firstly, once your coffee is in the basket, feel free to give it a little tap to settle it down. If you have a needle distribution tool for espresso, this is a great time to use it. It helps distribute the coffee in the basket and also get rid of any potential clumps that might be there. Feel free to give it another little tap after you've settled. The other extra is one of these, it's an AeroPress paper filter. In a 3-cup unit and bigger, you can get an AeroPress filter just here underneath the top part of the section. This will add another layer of filtration alongside the metal piece here which gives you a cleaner cup and also it seems a slightly better extraction overall. With the slightly larger units, I'd recommend choosing a little water to wet the filter, not to rinse it for paper taste, but to help it stick in place so it doesn't move around when you're prepping your pot. And the last constant for brewing is avoid the hot sputtering phase at the end of brewing. When you brew, keep your lid open and keep an ear and an eye out on your brew. A watched pot is a good pot in this situation. At the end of a brew, we definitely want to avoid uncondensed steam passing from the boiler right through the coffee, causing an angry spurting, sputtering phase. If that happens, it's making your coffee taste very bitter, and at that point you want to rinse the pot under the cold tap to cool it down immediately and to stop brewing before it adds too much bitterness to the cup. These constants I think will make any brew better, but we can take it even further. Let me walk you through a brew of a particular coffee from start to finish and give you the additional variables that you need to worry about. So of course the biggest variable you are gonna use is gonna be the coffee that you choose to brew. Here I'm brewing a relatively light-roasted coffee that is roasted for espresso, but is still on the lighter end of things. That's gonna dictate a couple of key things. Firstly, how fine I grind the coffee. The lighter the roast, the finer you'll need to grind it to get a good extraction from it. Lighter roasts are harder to properly extract than darker roasts. Here I'll be finer than filter coffee, but certainly not close to espresso. Good bit coarser than espresso, but finer than you might want to brew a one-cup V60. If you brewing a pretty fine AeroPress, you're kind of getting in the ballpark for a brew of this size. Secondly, it's gonna determine how full my boiler is. Now in some situations I want to fill the boiler a little bit less. A less-filled boiler will brew a little earlier and will have a lower overall brew temperature. So if I was brewing a darker roast, I might only fill this boiler two thirds to three quarters of the way full. But with a lighter roast, I need all the water I can get to properly extract the flavors from this lighter-roasted coffee. Therefore, I'm gonna fill this right up until the base of the safety valve. This technique is aiming to get as much water as possible through the coffee before it starts to sputter and get angry. If you do that well, you can really beautifully extract pretty light-roasted coffees and have a very tasty cup. With a darker roast it can be advantageous to have less water in the boiler below, not just from a brew temperature perspective, but it will stop you brewing that little bit earlier. Your end cup will be stronger, thicker, richer, but that's often what people want from a darker roast, just with less of that harsh bitterness at the back of your throat. Freshly boiled water into the base, coffee in, and then you're gonna need a towel just to hold the base as you screw it together. Now this is where things get a little bit more complicated, and this is really key to the whole technique. When we heat this pot, we want to generate enough heat in the boiler to create steam pressure to press that hot water through the coffee. What we don't want to do is keep heating that pot to the point that there's loads of pressure, the water gets really hot and the whole thing overheats and tastes bad. So what we're gonna look to do is heat the pot until liquid begins to flow through coffee and then try and maintain that pressure, not increase it much at all from that point onwards. So here, on this gas, I've got a little adapter plate here to keep this thing nice and safe, which will have an impact, I'm gonna put a relatively low flame on it. And I would recommend that for most heating situations. With an electric hob, I would recommend preheating the hob before you even think about making coffee, otherwise you'd be waiting a very long time, but with gas, with induction, with an adaptor plate, I would go for a relatively low heat, certainly below half power. Heating the water gently is key to the technique. I've seen people have some success by putting the pot in a frying pan to help buffer the heat from the flame. That's just a little bit wasteful 'cause you are really heating a lot of excess metal to heat a pot, not a truly efficient affair, but it kind of works, and so I quite like adapter plates like this for gas and induction. As soon as it's on the heat, I'd recommend opening the lid so you can see what's happening. We're gonna pay a lot of attention to the liquid coming out of the pot, because as soon as liquid appears, we wanna essentially reduce the heat as much as it's possible without causing the whole thing to lose temperature and the brew to stall. So in this case when liquid starts to flow, I'm gonna turn off the gas knowing that my adapter plate is still very hot and adding heat into the system. If I was on an electric hob I might move my pot just to the side, 'cause it does stay hot for quite a long time afterwards. And on gas, if I'm on a direct flame, I'd wanna run as low as I possibly could. Same with induction, with an induction-friendly pot, you wanna run as low as is possible once liquid starts to flow. If that liquid flow increases in speed, I'd temporarily remove the pot from the flame. If it slows down and seems to stall, I'd wanna add a little bit more heat in again. With the adapter plate it's kind of easy because I can just turn off the heat, and generally speaking, the plate will supply enough heat for the rest of the brew. But we'll measure the brew at the end in a simple way to see how successful we've been, and we'll know then how to tweak and improve our recipe for the next brew. I've now cut the heat and I'm just gonna watch this flow. If it starts to pick up a little bit too much, I may remove it from the heat entirely, but right now it's looking nice and steady and even and that's good. And I'm just watching and waiting for that sputtering sound which will mean we really have to stop, this pot's too hot. A quick shout out to The Wired Gourmet's channel, his video on moka pots I think was really useful and kind of pioneered this technique of temperature surfing the pot to get as much liquid through as you can. The pot's pretty close to done. We've started to get some sputtering, time to stop. Now as soon as you've brewed, you want this liquid out of the pot. The pot was very hot, especially the aluminium ones, and that doesn't necessarily make the coffee taste better. What we're also gonna do is weigh how much liquid we got, that's actually really useful. So in this case, we got about 200 grams out. That's a really high yield for a pot here where we got maybe 280 grams of water in the base. Generally speaking, about two-thirds of what you put in is the maximum that you're realistically going to get out. And with lighter roasts, I would say you want as much through the coffee as you possibly can. With darker roasts, I'd be much happier with say, 150g coming out of this pot or even 120g, because I don't need all of that water to properly extract the coffee. Now this here is pretty strong, it's pretty intense. It's very enjoyable if you like a stronger coffee. I'd say it's even more enjoyable with lighter roasts to dilute it down a little bit as a kind of moka pot Americano, or you could go for something like a milk drink where this is the base of your drink and you're gonna add steamed or heated milk to that for a delicious beverage. Now if your pot comes up short, if you start sputtering before you've got your desired amount of liquid out, then there's two things that could be at play. One, your grind might be a little bit too fine. That tends to cause the system to heat up much quicker, and that can be a problem. However, generally speaking, I wanna use the finest grind that I can, especially with lighter roasts, to get maximum flavor, so the other issue may be that the pot got too hot too quickly. Try reducing the heat more once liquid starts to flow or having the pot spend a little bit more time off the heat. That way, you should be able to get to about two thirds of the liquid out of the pot without hitting that angry sputtering phase that adds so much bitterness to your cup. One last variable to discuss is the size of pot that you're using. This is really gonna come into it when it comes to reducing the heat. With a much larger pot like this, you can let the heat run that little bit further into liquid starting to flow than you can do it with a much smaller pot. Here, as soon as liquid appears, I'd pretty much take the whole pot off the heat. It doesn't need any more energy to get that very small amount of liquid through the coffee. With this thing, you are gonna add a little bit more heat for a little bit longer, just because there's so much water in that base compared to this thing here, there's a lot more energy required to kind of maintain that temperature and pressure. It might seem like a lot of effort, a lot of fuss, it gets easier the more you do it. I'm not gonna say this is the easiest brewer in the world.", "videoID": "BfDLoIvb0w4"}, {"title": "$50 vs $500 Vs $500,000 Coffee Grinder", "text": "I am so excited to make today's video, I've wanted to make this for years. Today, we're gonna to compare a $50 grinder, a $500 grinder, with a $500,000 coffee grinder! Let me explain what's going on. I am here at Cometeer in Gloucester, Massachusetts. And if you don't know Cometeer, they buy delicious coffee, they extract it, they flash freeze it, and you, when you want to drink it, melt it back into hot water, or even cold water if you want to, and drink and enjoy. Now, when I was here, I did ask if I could indulge in making a video I've wanted to make for literally years. I wanted to play with the fanciest of fancy coffee grinders, and they very kindly said yes, with a few caveats. Now a couple of important disclosures. I'm here for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I'm here to taste some of the extractions, some of the capsules they've made of Square Mile's Coffee, and secondly, I do have an ongoing relationship with Cometeer. So watching this, you should absolutely treat this video like an ad. I might have told you a little bit of a lie earlier on. I said what I showed you was a half million dollar grinder. It's sort of is and it isn't. I showed you the bit that you load the coffee beans into. The grinder itself was out of shot. And as accommodating as Cometeer have been, they did have one hard line, I can't go into the secret room where they grind and extract coffee, 'cause they're doing some proprietary stuff in there and we can't film that. But otherwise, we can have some fun still. So here's the lineup. We've got a $50 grinder, we've got a $500 grinder, and we've got a half million dollar grinder, and we're gonna do some tests. And we're gonna start with some taste tests. I'm going to brew coffee, I'm gonna just a pour-over, 30:500 of each of the three, and just have a taste and see what's going on. But let's look a little bit more at our contenders today. $50 for the Sboly, I think? It says it's a conical burr grinder. You've got your grind adjustment at the front here. We have already kind of matched the grind settings across all three grinders. This is at nearly its finest setting, which is kind of interesting. Now next to it is a grinder I'm pretty excited to test, It's the new Baratza Vario+, it's about $500. It's not on general sale yet, and I'm grateful to Baratza for agreeing to sell me one of these a little bit early. Interestingly to me, to match the grinds between the two we're at a very coarse setting on this grinder, 'cause it's espresso capable. This, despite saying it can do extra fine, hmm, for $50, no, I don't think it can. So before we go too much further, I do need to very quickly explain the differences between the burr sets of the three grinders, 'cause they're all different. The cheapest one has a conical shaped burr set, the central burr is a kind of cone-shape, which gives you a lot of cutting surface for relatively low RPMs. And it's very common in cheaper grinders to have conical burr sets, 'cause that way they can kick out a lot of ground coffee without having a powerful motor. A lot of people would prefer flat burr sets. These have two flat disks that spin against each other with cutting teeth, and these are, for many people, preferable to conical burr sets in lots environments for having a sort of more uniform particle size distribution. But the big, fancy, fancy expensive grinder doesn't work like either of these. Instead, it has roller mills. Now these are kind of long, cylindrical sort of burrs essentially, and they have 2 per set that roll in towards each other and the beans are fed between the middle. And you have multiple stages of these rollers and you can control each one, so you have really high throughput and a ton of control over how you grind the coffee. So what I'll do first is I'm gonna grind 30 grams of coffee in each one and we'll have a listen, see how it goes and, and make a V60. That's pretty quiet. Yeah, that smells like burning motor. You could really smell the motor struggling with that coffee, and that was not a good smell or a reassuring smell, if I'm honest. The Baratza. Just looking at these, you can see a difference. Notable to me, it felt like the Baratza was a little bit slower, but we are gonna do some speed tests later, which will be kind of fun. So I'll get the coffee now from the big fancy grinder and we'll start making some pour-overs. So we brewed three V60s, 30 grams in, 500 grams of water. Here is the Sboly, this is the Baratza, and this is the Cometeer fancy, fancy grinder. It's not a blind tasting today because it's gonna be, well, I think pretty obvious between them, and so I just want to taste the difference and talk about the kind of flavors involved. So as we taste this one here, it's just rough, do you know what I mean? It's just harsh, it's bitter, it's astringent, it's mean, there's not much sweetness at all. That's not a great cup of coffee at all. In the middle, the big thing that you notice is this improvement in sweetness and this decrease in bitterness. It's definitely a significantly better tasting cup of coffee, like there's a big leap there in quality. It's a night and day difference. Now when you get to the third bowl, it feels definitely like there's a little drop in extraction. It feels lighter, but it feels very sweet. It feels very clean. It doesn't leave any unpleasant finish in there, it's just sweet and gentle. I would want, in a way, this but a little bit finer to just pull the extraction up a little bit more. But you would guess then that the grind distribution on this isn't very good, because it tastes like it's muddy and it's harsh, which probably means fines. This tastes much better, and this just tastes very clean, very sweet. There's probably a big variance in the distribution of grinds. Now the fun thing about being here is that I don't have to just speculate. This is a very subjective experience and I could tell you anything and you can't really know, but I can show you something objective. 'Cause not only do they have a very fancy grinder here, they've got something I really want, a laser particle size analyzer. You put ground coffee in, it uses lasers to analyze the distribution of particles. How many pieces are this big, that big, all that kind of stuff. So I'm gonna go and look at these with Alex Kaplan, he's Cometeer's head of coffee product, and he's gonna talk me through what the analysis of these grinders looks like. What are we seeing here? Just talk me through the chart. - So this first graph we're looking at is the volume density chart as a percentage of the overall grounds for the three different grinders. The red line here is the $50 grinder, the green line is the $500 grinder, and the blue line is Cometeer's $500,000 grinder. And we can clearly see a taller peak and a tighter distribution for the higher quality grinders. Towards the left here are smaller particles and towards the right are larger particles, and we can see that the cheaper grinder is making more large particles and more fine particles, and fewer of the target size. - So a classic poor distribution. Show me another thing. -  So what we see here is the surface area distribution of the three different grinders. So this peak towards the right is our target coffee ground size. As we get towards this first peak, that's the contribution of surface area due to fines, and we see that the cheaper coffee grinder is making much more fines and fewer of the target particles again. - One other point, I do want to just talk about the Baratza just quickly. It's doing okay! -  Absolutely, I'm very impressed by the Baratza, and it's interesting to me that it's about halfway between, on this scale, the really high quality grinder and the really cheap grinder. - If you're curious how that big grinder tastes, if you want to check out Cometeer, there's a link in the description down below. It's not an affiliate link, but you should probably treat it just like an affiliate link, just so you know. So now it's time for a speed test, because I feel like speed is a big deal. With any piece of equipment, the more efficient it is, the faster it goes, the better it must be, right? So we're gonna grind with each of these two grinders 30 grams of coffee, and we're gonna time it and see how fast they are. Let's do that now. 20 seconds, not bad. Let's try the Baratza. All right. A little bit slower. So if you reverse engineer the maths, this will do, at this particular grind setting, about 90 grams a minute. This one, a little bit less, maybe like 75 grams a second, I'll do the actual maths and put it underneath me now, but that's around it. Let's compare that to something much, much, much more expensive. To do that, we can't just grind 30 grams of coffee, we need to grind a lot more. With a roller mill, it's impossible to grind that much and have any idea how long it took. We're gonna need to grind 30 kilos of coffee. Let's see how fast that thing is. So we're back on the production floor again, because it's time for the speed test. I'm gonna load the big, big, fancy grinder with coffee. We're gonna grind 30 kilos here. I'm gonna load some coffee. - 60 Seconds. - Thank you! Okay, so the roller mill, the fancy grinder, 30 kilos per minute, which is a lot more than 90 grams a minute. It's not like a thousand times more, but it's close, you know what I mean? I feel like in this particular case, you really get what you pay for in terms of productivity. Now you'll have noticed that I was thrown a bag of coffee, because I overheard something as we were talking that was kind of interesting. And that's the idea that with a roller mill, you can do something really cool, that you can change the shape of that distribution curve. It's not just about moving the peak up or down, you can move other parts of the curve to shape the distribution of coffee any way you want. So as part of that speed test, we also had them, very kindly agree, to adjust the grinder very slightly. I don't know quite what they're doing, they're never gonna tell me this fun stuff, probably moving one or two of the rollers to change things, and then we get an outcome. Let's go and see what changed. So we've now got the two charts, the original grinds from the roller mill and then the tweaked kind of shape curve, right? What's changed? -  So we can see a few changes here. The first on this volume density graph is that the new curve here in green is much finer as a peak. So we're able to change that target size with a lot of precision. And then you can also see the shape on the tail is quite different, where there's a slight hump around this 50 micron size. So we're able to augment not only our target, but the rest of the distribution as well. - How does this look in the kind of other charts that show surface area? -  So here, if we pull it up, we can see some interesting data on the fines for the two surface area curves. So what we can see is the old graph in blue and the new one in green, that as we saw before, the total peak of the target size is shifted finer to the left there, but in addition, there are fewer overall fines, which you can see from the smaller peak in that fine size class. - So you can kinda make one grinder act like a number of different grinders in a way. I think people assume that a grinder and a burr set produces a result, a distribution, and this sort of says, if you have enough toys, you can play with that and you have sort of freedom to detach your fines from your targets and play with each of those things. So what do we learn? What do we take away from all of this stuff? I think that the takeaway here is a beautiful expression of kind of diminishing returns. Spending $50 on a coffee grinder is probably better than buying a bunch of certain pre-grounds, but it's not great. But, and I'm not saying you have to spend 500, but by the time you've spent 500, you've had such an incredible improvement in cup quality, and I would say it's kind of linear at that point, right? Spending 100 will be kind of twice as good as this, but above $500, for someone at home, it really is a world of diminishing returns. I think it's really cool how far you can go. And if you're interested in kind of pushing coffee in a certain place and getting the most out of it, I'm glad the technology exists, but you can sort of see it on a chart. You know, like the jump in price for a thousand times more than this, yeah, you can see what you get for your money. Now you might ask at $500,000, is it worth it? Well, I think it is, if you're trying to do incredible brewing at mass scale, then yeah, it absolutely is worth it. Is it worth it for you to be saving your pennies and not buying a house and instead buying a grinder? Well, maybe not. I have to say, I said at the start, this video has been on my list for years, it's been kind of like a bucket list video. I am totally satisfied by what we have learned and looked at and discovered today.", "videoID": "WkYqHWThIpA"}, {"title": "Why Cheap Coffee Makers Suck (And How To Fix Them)", "text": "Today, we're gonna look at these things. These are very cheap filter coffee makers. How cheap? Well, this one cost me \u00a330 and this one is very slightly fancier at \u00a339. And that's, I think, pretty cheap for a machine that makes coffee. For \u00a330 in the UK, you can buy something like a Hario Drip Decanter. This, this thing costs the same as that. And this makes great coffee. But historically we've said that these don't make great coffee. Now this doesn't heat water. This is just a plastic V60 and a carafe to catch the coffee, nothing special here. But we can we make great coffee with it. But why can't we make great coffee with this? So the idea is we're gonna look at this kind of a brewer and understand how it works, why it sucks, and what we can do to overcome the ways in which it is flawed, to maybe get better coffee out of it. Because I'm not saying that everyone should go and buy a cheap coffee maker and hack it and play with it to get good coffee out of it. I think it's worth investing in well-made equipment that will last a lifetime. And frankly, that's not this. But if you can't afford anything else, but you want better coffee or you're brewing on someone else's set up and you want to do the best you can, well, let's find out what we can do to make the best coffee possible with the tools that we have. So how do they work? If you open these up and you look inside, and you open up from the base and they don't really want you to do that. But if you do, make sure it's off and be careful. You'll see just how simple these things are. So you put your water in the water tank at the back, and it feeds through a one-way valve down into the base of the unit. And that's where the heating element is. And that element actually heats the hot plate that this glass carafe sits on. So unfortunately you can't have this without the hot plate, 'cause it's the same heating element. Now, as the water passes through a tube, surrounded by the element, it gets hot. Some of it will boil and that steam will help press the water up the tube, over the coffee, and just drop it out of its little hole, exit hole, onto the coffee below. And that's basically it. And it'll do it till it runs out of water. Inside here you've got like a little thermostat on the element to control the temperature to make sure it doesn't really overheat. So that's it. You've got a heating element, a thermostat, some tubes, and a bit of plastic, and a little bit of glass, but that's what you get for your money. And it makes coffee, which is kind of amazing. But when you make coffee, it does have some problems. Let's make some coffee. Now this one here has a nice little swing away action. I think that's quite nice. It's 'cause this is fixed and doesn't move. Let's just throw some coffee in, some water in. Now we're brewing 30g to 500ml. I'm not gonna use the lines on the side of this tank, because they make no sense. There are two sets of numbers, one for large cups and one for small cups. And a small cup currently is 75 milliliters. Just think about that for a second, 75 milliliters. That is two and a half ounces to Americans. Now that is a small cup of coffee, but really who is endorsing this? If you put a temperature probe inside this, then you'll see the first liquid out isn't very hot, because it's sort of the other side of the heating element already because of the nature of the way that the tubes fill. So that first water out is kind of cold, and it slowly over the course of the brew gets hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter. Now, generally, as soon as you brew this, you want to turn these off. Don't leave the hot plate running. That will cook your coffee. It will taste gross. How is it? It could be worse. Honestly, like it's not that bad. It's nice coffee. It's nice water. It's ground on a grinder that costs 100 times more than this. So, you know, we've set it up for success, but it's not, I would say, a flawless cup of coffee by any stretch. I think you can taste that kind of colder start. You know what I mean? And it brewed for a long time, around kind of 90 degrees Celsius, and didn't really get hot until the very end of the brew. Now, if you've followed the channel for a while, you'll know that I'm actually pro brewing with boiling water. So what I wanna fix about this brewer there is the start. The start is too cold. Most of the brew is too low of a temperature, and you can taste a kind of absence of goodness here, right? It tastes a bit under-extracted, a little bit empty, could be better. Now this thing, the way that they work is very simple. Once it's on, it's on. It's got no kind of bloom function, and that's kind of a shame. So that's maybe something worth trying to work out. And then if we look at the coffee bed, you can see that we had kind of like a big crater dug in the middle of this. The water has come out with a little bit of force and just burrowed a hole in the coffee. So that's not gonna do wonders for evenness of extraction. So I'm gonna wonder, is there something we can do about that? While I have this open, actually, there is a piece of technology in this thing, and in this thing too that is kind of interesting. Because you've got a hot plate, what they do is they put in a little spring here and a little stopper so that when nothing is underneath this cone, when the jug isn't there, it closes the stopper and it doesn't drip. Because what you don't want is to pull your carafe out, have this drip onto a very hot, hot plate, sizzle, kind of do the whole cooked dehydrated coffee sticky thing on there. So they got a little steep and release function by mistake. And I wonder if that's also something that we can potentially manipulate to help us make better coffee. So the first thing we're gonna deal with is brew temperature. And the fix for this is actually pretty well known and pretty well talked about. You may have come across it before. We're gonna fill the tank with hot water. Now, I don't know for certain how the plastic in this will do with boiling water inside. I don't worry from a safety perspective, but there might be some funny tastes. I don't really know. I think everyone uses BPA-free stuff in sort of commercial food appliances these days. So we should be okay. What I'll also do is stick a probe into the coffee bed, 'cause there's another experiment after this that I'm kind of curious about. But let's brew with some boiling water in the back of this thing, otherwise identical setup. And I'll keep this cup to the side to compare to the next cup. So water in, into the coffee bed, start logging. That was a very interesting brew. It held in the sort of mid to low 90s at the sort of the top of the slurry above the coffee bed, which is pretty great actually for lighter roasts. Certainly, that's a nice high brewing temperature. I don't know how this kind of constant high heat works in comparison to say a pouring kettle, which will be losing heat over the course of the brew. So a typical V60 at home will have its peak temperature quite early on, and then it will decline towards the end. This is staying hotter for longer. That's interesting. Definitely more extracted. Getting toward the upper end of where I want it to be from an extraction perspective, actually. If you look at what it did to the coffee bed, it was an even more violent brew it seemed. It's definitely kind of dug a hole in the middle of this thing, and I think that's probably bad from an extraction perspective, and I will deal with that. One more slightly silly temperature experiment, but I'm kind of curious, I've got 450 grams of hot water here, instead of 500, and 50 grams of ice. And towards the end of the brew, I'm gonna drip feed the ice in right under the hot water spout to see if I can bring down the brew temperature just a little bit towards the end. Will that help? I don't know. Let's find out. I know it's ridiculous, but that's what we do here. Now, that was definitely interesting. Though I probably timed my ice badly. We had a bit of a U-shaped curve of temperature there, where the bottom of the bed was sort of just below the 90s, which is fine for the bottom of the bed. And then we kind of held it there with the ice. And then I put the last piece in, and it kind of tanked down into like the 70, and then crept back up to like 80 towards the end. That's pretty good. That's definitely interesting. Okay. Maybe there's something there. Okay, let's put that in the maybe pile of kind of interesting things and ridiculous ideas that we tested today, and move on. So now let's talk about the bloom. It's a thing that we do in pourover brewing all the time. We pour a little water on, let it steep. Let the kind of coffee degas a little bit before we pour to get a higher extraction and a little bit more evenness in our extraction too. This doesn't do that. Once you turn this on, it delivers water till it's done. So there's no option for that. And fancier brewers do have bloom options built in, either customizable ones, or just kind of part of the brewing process will do a delivery of water, a pause, and then deliver more. Obviously, we could do this manually. I could turn the machine on, turn the machine off for a period of time, and turn it back on again. I was looking for a slightly more ridiculous solution to that, so I got one of these. It is a pretty generic smart plug. So this connects to the internet, and can be controlled by the internet. What I did was I connected a few services like, \"If this, then that,\" which is always useful, one, my phone's voice assistant, and a service called Apaleo, which lets me do kind of logic things, lets me lets me build timers essentially. It's not the greatest route. I'm sure someone much smarter than me could give you a much simpler way of doing this, but I just wanted to kind of proof of concept it. So here's how it works. I would talk to my phone and trigger the whole thing and it would turn on the brewer. I could have the on switch on, but the plug itself would be off. And it would turn on for about 35 seconds. That should be enough time for it to start delivering water. Now I'm gonna put hot water in this ahead of time, which is maybe not the easiest thing, but we're automating a process here. So just go with me. After 35 seconds, it switches off for about 20 seconds. Now I know we want to bloom for longer than that, but when I turn this back on, water won't immediately be delivered. There'll be a little bit of a gap again. And after 20 seconds blooming, the machine switches back on and brews, and it switches off after I think, five minutes from that sort of trigger. Having set this all up and found that it works, a small downside is that this machine switch, when you cut the power to the machine, it just turns off. It flicks off. Now I could probably just gaffer tape that in place and that would work fine, a bit hacky. But I just wanted to proof of concept it, right. Like I just wanted to see, does this work, does this help? So, let's do what we did without the ice, but everything else with the bloom phase, but actually with one more twist. I said that there's a steep and release button here. What I'm gonna do is do the entire bloom phase without the carafe in place. And at the end of the bloom phase, I'm gonna put the carafe in. That means that we'll have a kind of steeped bloom, which should help with evenness a little bit more, and then it should start to brew. And then we should have a good time, I hope. Hey Siri, brew some coffee. - Okay. - Drain you out, and it should kick back on in a second. Now, just as this finishes up, obviously, if you were to tape over this switch, you're overriding a safety mechanism and even though my routine does have the switch being switched off at the plug as part of it, that doesn't always make it 100% safe. So just, if you're gonna mess with this stuff, be aware that there are safety features that exist for a reason. These hot plates get incredibly hot, hot enough to boil water. So leaving them on hot isn't always a good idea, with coffee on top or not, frankly. Interesting, I think from, certainly here to here, and here to here, we've had an increase in strength, which means an increase in extraction. And with the same grind settings and the same water and the same-ish temperatures with the exception of this one, increased extraction probably suggests increased evenness of extraction too and I think the bloom probably helped. But for all our improvements, I look at the bed of coffee and it still looks like there's been a bit of violence, right? Like it's a flatter bed actually, having had the bloom. That seems to be a benefit for sure, that kind of layer of water on top, perhaps buffering the water coming in, the violence of that. I think I have a solution, or I think I have something that might help a little bit, but I'm not sure. I'll be testing it for the first time and you'll be joining me as well.

Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So here's what I've been thinking about. The water comes out of this as like a little spout, and it's very simple. It's very simply made. It's just a kind of a hole and water falls out with a bit of pressure, but there's no real distribution. And I don't know if it's practical to try and replace something like this with a spray head. 3D printing isn't great for kind of the materials you'd want to use with sort of hot water, and that's what most people are printing with. So that doesn't seem like a sensible solution. And then I was thinking about this, it's called a Melodrip. Now it's been around for quite a while. And the idea here is that you'd use it with say, pour over brewing, and you'd pour your water into this, and it would distribute the water into a kind of a shower head over the coffee. But I didn't want to just sort of do that, the whole brew. That just doesn't seem fun or practical. And so that was kind of out. Then I was thinking about the sort of drip style cold brewers, right? Like Peter McKinnon made a very beautiful video about his the other day. And it reminded me that what you'd do is you put a piece of paper on top, as well as below the coffee, 'cause the paper helps distribute the water out. So I wondered if you could do that. But then I thought let's use less paper. Let's try and put a metal disc on top of the coffee, essentially to buffer the coffee itself from the water coming in, right. It should sit over the coffee under the spout the whole time. It should help mitigate the violence of the spout. But I don't know. There is just one way to find out. Now if we look inside here, we have a flatter bed, but it's not gone exactly to plan. The disc has sort of slightly wedged itself in just into the top layer. But overall, I just don't know what impact it's had. Now the obvious downside is you've got to get it out. So maybe paper is a better solution from a practical perspective, but I don't know if paper would like float around or float away. But it's worth testing. Having had a taste, I think we can call it as a fail. It feels like a big drop in extraction and a big drop in evenness. It's not necessarily that sour. It just feels like it somehow bypassed a bit of the coffee doing it this way. Not a success. I feel like there's some sort of idea here in distributing water better, but I can't find one that's practical, easy, obvious, you know, not gonna add a ton of cost to the machine. If you have any ideas, let me know down in the comments below. I'd be really interested to hear. Now, I feel like we've come a long way. We've done a bunch of different experiments and slowly we're putting it all together. What I'm gonna do now is brew the best brew I can with what we've learned from this thing. And at the same time, I'll also brew a V60 of the same coffee, same dose, same grind, all of those kind of things with the technique that I typically use, which is linked up here, if you don't know about that. And then I will taste them and compare them blind to see if there's an obvious difference, to see if this is getting close to a V60, if it's really close, if it's miles away. I just want a kind of point of reference to kind of wrap things up and see how far we've come. And to complete a triangle of tasting, I'll throw in an untweaked brew from this thing, which brews the same as this thing really, as a kind of do nothing, what'd you get, do lots of stuff, what'd you get, V60 what'd you get, but blind. So we need to let this cool and equalize in temperature a little bit, and we'll clean up this, and then Michael will come in and switch them around so I don't know which is which. So this one here I would guess is the regular little batch brewer that we didn't do anything to. It just tastes empty and a bit hollow. And like it has that kind of cold start taste and it's not bad, actually. It tasted, the coffee that went in, reasonably. It's just not that good. Next up, I would say is probably this one. This one is a big jump in extraction. It is much sweeter than this one here. It's much more complex. It's a really quite nice cup of coffee. It's not as good as this cup of coffee. It actually tastes slightly less extracted than this one here, but it just is a little bit prettier. I don't like using the pretentious language, but it's got a bit more clarity to it. It's nice and sweet. I wish it actually had a little bit more extraction like this one, but this one does not have the evenness of this one here. But this is the winner. So I'm gonna say this is the V60. I'm gonna say this is our modded technique, and I'm gonna say, this is the unmodified Russell Hobbs thing. And it is, it's the Russell Hobbs. Hopefully, this is the Melitta. It is the Melitta. That's good. Which means this is the V60 as predicted. And I would say, this is really not a bad cup of coffee. I'm kind of into this. I'm kind of, yeah, I think it's tasty. I think it's good. I think there's a difference here, in that little bit more clarity. The fight is evenness, right, like water delivery in these things sucks and finding a way to overcome that remains a challenge that I'm frustrated I didn't fix in this video, but it's one I'll keep thinking about and trying to come up with a decent solution for. Leave me a comment if you've got a good idea. But I guess the learnings from this would be as follows. If you're gonna take on some of these tips, and you don't have to do them all, right. If you had to just sort of pick and choose a few, I would definitely 100% start with hot water in the brew chamber. That's the biggest single gain you will get in cup quality. The second thing I would do would be the sort of steep and release, right? If you have a cheap brewer that has that option to it, use the steep and release function. It's definitely an improvement to evenness and extraction. I think that's definitely a win. Three would be a bloom phase, right? And you could sort of skip the bloom phase in a way by having a steep phase and then putting your carafe in after say 30 seconds or when it's filled a certain amount. Having it go on, off, on again, I think is a benefit. And then lastly, if you wanna throw some ice in at the end, I think it's kind of interesting. It's a lot of extra work for pretty limited returns, but it's kind of fun. It's interesting. It has an impact I didn't really expect it to. But yeah, if you try that, definitely let me know what your results are like. I think for darker roasts, I'd definitely be leaning that way, as a way to sort of moderate brew temperature towards the end of the brew, where you're likely to pick up a lot of very harsh very bitter notes, but that's the deal with cheap coffee makers.", "videoID": "P-Ga8SRhRrE"}, {"title": "A Beginner's Guide to Resting Coffee", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about resting coffee. We're gonna talk about the sort of science behind why we rest coffee and cover best practices for resting it for espresso brewing and also for filter brewing. Now, I think resting coffee very quickly becomes a point of anxiety in someone's coffee journey. At the start you understand that fresh is good and therefore you think fresher is better, and you go online and you buy coffee from a roaster, and they ship it to you the day it's roasted. So you're like, \"Okay, great. This is super fresh, therefore it is super good\" And then you hear, \"No, maybe not. maybe fresher is sort of better, but it still needs to rest and age a little bit before you brew it\" And then you're stuck with the question of, \"How long should I rest it for? What's the right amount? Am bring this to soon? Am I missing out on something? Did I rest it too long? Have most of the good flavors gone? What's the right thing to do?\" And I think if we understand what's going on inside the coffee, if we understand how it affects the brewing process, then you can make an informed decision, because a bunch of the factors that affect resting are kind of down to you, your home, your lifestyle, and your brewing method. Let's start at the top. Let's talk about why we rest coffee. All of this starts in the roasting process. When you roast coffee, there's a bunch of chemistry going on, a bunch of browning reactions, and almost all of those produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct. A surprising amount of carbon dioxide. You'll often see a study cited that says a kilo of coffee will produce 10 liters of CO2 during the roasting process. Now, most of this escapes the coffee bean during the roasting process. Now, to say that one kilo of coffee does that, makes 10 liters, I think is confusing and actually disingenuous. It produces a lot of CO2, but how you roast it, especially the darkness of the roast really, really, really impacts the amount of CO2 that you produce. Light roasts produce a lot less CO2 than dark roasts. The darker you roast, the more of these kind of browning reactions you have, right up until the point of combustion, which I don't recommend reaching, but it does produce an enormous amount of CO2. Now, as I said, most of the CO2 does escape the coffee bean during the roasting process, but quite a lot is trapped inside. And over time it will slowly leach out. It'll just sort of come out of the bean, but there's a couple of factors that determine this. As I said, the lighter you roast, the less CO2 that you're gonna have, but confusingly, the lighter you roast, the denser the end coffee bean is. That means the harder it is for the CO2 that is trapped inside it to get out. Now, a dark roast will produce a lot more CO2, but the bean can't keep hold of it because that roasting process has made it so much more porous. The beans puff out and become less and less dense and more and more brittle the darker you roast them. And so, with a very dark roast, the bean can't really keep hold of the CO2 inside of it. And that's kind of it. This is the thing that I really want you to focus on, which is what coffee do I have? Again, the higher grown a coffee would be the more dense the seed is gonna be, the slower it will de-gas. Now, why are we worried about it de-gassing in the first place? Well, when you finally come to brew coffee, water hitting the grounds really helps liberate a lot of the CO2. When you're making a filter coffee, say a V60, you'll see that in the bloom. The fresher the coffee is the bigger the bloom you'll see as you start to sort of pour water onto the grounds. Again, this is a pretty good visual. If you take a dark roast, you'll typically see, especially a fresh one, a much bigger bloom than you would see in a lighter roast, even if that light roast is very, very fresh, 'cause it's just really is a lot less CO2 in lighter roasted coffees. Now, while filter coffee might be a very good visual explainer of, kind of blooming and about the CO2 trapped inside the coffee bean, it really causes trouble when we come to a much more intense brewing process like espresso. There, if you have a lot of CO2 coming out of the coffee, and again, typically you're using darker or more developed roast that will have a little bit more CO2 than say, a filter coffee. But in that scenario, CO2 coming out of the grounds as the water is hitting, can be very disruptive to the brewing process, making it harder and harder to properly extract the coffee. Therefore, with both filter coffee and espresso, what we tend to do is rest the coffee for a period of time to allow some of the CO2 out, hopefully not let any real staling reactions take place, and then when we brew the coffee, it's easier to brew and it's easier to extract and ultimately, will taste better. Before we get into specific recommendations around resting coffees for filter and espresso, I do just want to touch on one other thing that I think is really interesting. You can, in certain situations, shortcut the resting period. This can be done, actually at the roasting stage in terms of how you cool the coffee. This was taught to me, it must be 15 plus years ago by Tim Wendelboe, who had needed to use a coffee a few days after roasting in a coffee competition. And what they'd done is they'd used what's called quenching to cool the coffee. Traditionally, in a lot of specialty companies, coffee will come out of the roaster into a cooling tray and a fan will drag ambient air through the bed of coffee to cool it down to room temperature within two or three minutes. Once you get into roasting very large batches of coffee, you can't actually do that. There's too much thermal mass, and if you don't cool the coffee fast enough, then it can kind of keep roasting in the tray, and eventually, potentially catch fire with darker roasts. What you tend to see, therefore, are called quenching systems, where you spray a very fine mist of water onto the coffee beans. This mist should hit the coffee beans that are about 200 plus degrees Celsius and instantly evaporate. And that evaporative cooling really drops the temperature of the coffee beans very, very, very fast. The more you quench, the more outgassing of CO2 you have at the same time. It seems the coffee as a whole seems to stale faster when it has been quenched. This is occasionally useful, if you're a roaster and you really need to brew a coffee very quickly, especially for espresso, then yes, you can use just a spray bottle almost, and spray cool the coffee. You don't want to add water to the coffee beans. Everything you spray on wants to evaporate. If you leave water in the coffee beans, you will rapidly accelerate staling, and the coffee will taste bad pretty quickly. This is occasionally done by unscrupulous people who know that when you roast a kilo of coffee, you might only get 850 grams out because of loss of moisture and other things during the roasting process. If you add some water back in, you might end up with 900 grams instead, and you can sell water for the price of coffee, but that coffee will not taste good and it will not age well, but that's maybe not your concern if you're just trying to make as much money as possible. I can't give you specific instances of this happening, but it is a thing that you can do, should you be an unscrupulous coffee roaster and business person. Going all the way back, that's kind of the, the one sort of cheat to really make a difference to the speed of outgassing. But, a couple of other things do make a difference. The temperature in which you store coffee really matters. You'll see this when you freeze coffee, you can still have a coffee that at the end of it has quite a lot of crema when you brew it, it still tastes really good. It's like it's still fresh in many ways. The warmer the environment that you store your coffee in, the more rapidly it will de-gas. That can be useful, but know that you're also accelerating other staling reactions, oxidization, all of the things that you don't really want to happen to the coffee. Generally speaking, the kind of room temperature of around 20 degrees Celsius is about as hot as I would recommend storing coffee. Though I understand that in certain parts of the world and certain situations, you can't store it that cool, but just know you should not rest the coffee as long, because it is degassing that much faster. So you'll have noticed that most bags of coffee that ship around the world have in them, a little valve. You won't always see it clearly on the outside of the packaging, there might be just a few holes here. What's inside? Generally, something like this. It's a very simple, usually plastic valve that allows gas out, but doesn't allow fresh oxygen in. Know that if you let a bag of coffee degas, it does not substantially change the quantity of oxygen inside the bag. The CO2 does not displace air left inside the bag. It will displace both CO2 and air together at a similar ratio, so it's not a cheap way to somehow gas-flush your coffee by having the CO2 push out any air in the bag. Not true, does not work. This you'll see on bags of beans though. It's really truly essential on bags of ground coffee. If you seal a bag of ground coffee without a valve, it will burst. The pressure of the gas coming out of the grounds is usually enough to rupture the seal on a bag, and it just makes a bit of a mess. Occasionally, you'll see a bag where the valve has failed and you might see a puffy bag that looks a bit weird. That coffee is totally fine. It's not bad, it's not suffering from a lack of degassing. It'll still be degassing at a reasonable rate. It might seem a touch fresher when you very first open it, but really, it's not worth not buying, or it's not worth freaking out about if a valve has failed. Though, just be aware that if it's a lot of dark roasted coffee in there, again, that pressure may rupture the bag. A lot of people like to use storage jars like this, that's not a bad thing. They'll use vacuum chambers like this. These, I think confuse a lot of people. If you put very fresh coffee into one of these jars that lets you pull a vacuum and shows you that you've got a little vacuum pulled, that coffee will degas, and that will sort of equalize the pressure, which means that it looks like the vacuum has failed. That isn't the case. It's just the beans gassing. You'll find that the next time you pull a vacuum, it may take three or four days before it equalizes, and after that, it never happens again. It's not a faulty product, it's just gas coming out of the beans. You've pulled a vacuum, you've removed most of the air, so even though it looks like you've lost your vacuum, what's happened is you basically filled that space that was air with CO2. It doesn't mean fresh oxygen has gotten in, the system hasn't failed. It's just been an equalization of pressures. That was a lot of information. Let's wrap this up by giving you those specific recommendations about aging or resting your coffee based on the way that you're going to brew it. Let's start with filter coffee. Filter coffee isn't as big of a concern. Honestly, brewing coffee the next day after roasting won't taste as good as it could, but it won't taste that bad. Maybe 20 minutes after roasting, not ideal, but certainly the next day, it's basically drinkable and enjoyable, but it will get better after three or four days of good storage. With darker roasts, if you do enjoy those, then I would wait less time. I'd wait maybe two days, but for light roasts, medium roasts, four or five days is a good starting point. But I wouldn't worry too much about trying to rest it to a point of perfection. If you're blooming the coffee and you're brewing well, I don't think you're gonna have a big issue, and if you want to drink it, you can drink it. With very light roast, very dense coffees, yes, you might benefit stretching that out to maybe 10 days. In some cases, even longer. The taste of coffee that still has a lot of CO2 in it can be almost like forgotten sparkling water, where you have a kind of carbonic acid tang to it. There's an unpleasant sort of sourness, it'll be under extracted and it generally will taste a bit sour overall. Occasionally, if it's super fresh, you might taste a little bit of almost smoke, but that's really pretty rare, especially with lighter roasts. Espresso is a much bigger deal. Espresso is much more frustrating and that CO2 level in the grounds has a much bigger impact. With light roasts, I would probably be resting the coffee around 10 days. I think that's a good amount of time to make sure it's good for brewing. You're certainly not gonna start to generate negative tastes. Know that there was never that much CO2 to begin with. So when you start to pull shots from very light roasts, your crema might look a little thin. It was always that way. Light roasts will never produce a very thick crema. Once you get into a kind of medium roast, again, eight to 10 days I think is a very good starting point, just to let that CO2 degas, there is just a bit more of it, even if it is easier for it to leave the bean. And then with darker roasts, really, a couple of days is probably fine. You know what I mean? If you leave it much longer with dark roasts, you've got a lot of oil exposed on the surface. You've got a very porous coffee bean. You should really be concerned mostly about that coffee going stale, rather than an issue with the CO2 outgassing or the coffee resting properly. So fresher is really better with darker roasts. Again, a reminder that your ambient storage makes a difference. If you are freezing it, if you're putting it in a cold environment, maybe you store your coffee in a cellar or a basement, or your just house is a little bit cooler, then you do need to extend your resting times. If you live in a warmer house, a warmer climate, shorten your resting times accordingly. Pay attention to the roast, to the altitude of the coffee, and I think you should have all the information you need to rest the coffee and have a really great result at the end of it. But more than that, don't let it stop you enjoying your coffee.", "videoID": "Py8JOi3REg"}, {"title": "Should You Upgrade Your Grinder Burrs\uff1f", "text": "Should you upgrade the burrs inside your coffee grinder? That seems like a pretty simple question with a very obvious answer. If you could afford it, why wouldn't you upgrade? But it isn't that simple. I'm gonna talk about my experience with a couple of different grinders to give you a bit more understanding about the questions that you should be asking before you upgrade your grinder. Now, burr upgrading has been a thing that's become popular really in the last couple of years with the rise of one particular company called SSP based out of Korea. They've been a family-owned business since 1991. And really, in the last few years, have come to be seen as the kind of kings of grinder burrs. Their burrs in testing produced better results, better grind quality than other manufacturers. And that's really interesting. Now, those burrs are actually machine CNCd in Switzerland, but the company is based in Korea. I have in these two grinders, burrs by SSP. And that's had a couple of interesting impacts on the way that the grinder works. The first obvious question is, does the coffee taste better? Yes, yeah, it does. Actually, I like the taste of the coffee out of both of these grinders. Now, in the case of the Fellow grinder, the Ode, and you can watch the full review up here if you want to, I had a big problem with the burr set that came with it. They just didn't go fine enough for me. And with the SSP burr set that's in there, absolutely they can go very fine, much finer than espresso even, but that brings its own problems. I know people have tested the original Fellow burrs and had very good results with them at coarser grind settings, but for lighter roasts, it was definitely a frustration for me. And more recently, I've upgraded the burr set inside this, the Wilfa Uniform that I have at home. This has changed the way the grinder works in a bunch of interesting ways, but also brought some problems. This is really the crux of it. A grinder is a sum of two different parts in a way, right? There's the mechanism that spins the burrs and the burrs themselves. And that motor is often spec'd to the burr set that it's using. The design of the grinder is spec'd to the motor and the burr set that you're using. And when you change one part, it can have unintended consequences. I'll give you a very simple example, on this Wilfa grinder. Now, because the burr set is so different, it grinds much faster, and that's a real bonus. This grinder was a little slow before, now it's a much, much quicker grinder. But that added friction actually has a weird effect. While you're grinding coffee, the grinder will often begin to move its grind setting on its own. More confusingly, it'll often drag itself finer because of the rotation of the motor. That's a massive problem. If you're not paying attention, your grind will be a long way from where you want it to be. Your coffee is gonna taste bad. You'll have a mix of grind settings in there. But if it keeps its setting, well, yeah, the grind is more uniform, it's faster, it's better tasting coffee, it's a total win, but the experience, that's a problem. I really like the coffee that this produces. This burr set, this grinder together, I think make fantastic coffee. It's a little bit sweeter, more complex. The extraction's a little bit higher. It's very good. It's been, from a coffee perspective, a great upgrade. But from an experience perspective, I'm not sure I can keep this setup. And it's not Wilfa's fault, and it's not SSP's fault, it's my fault. I messed with the equilibrium of this grinder. I changed it and I used parts that were not spec'd for this grinder. That I think is really an important way to think about that decision you're making. You're gonna invalidate a warranty by changing the burr set inside a grinder. And there are gonna be unintended consequences. And that I think is not talked about enough. Now, like I said, with the Fellow Ode, I like this combination, but it's not recommended because once you're grinding finer, you're requiring a lot more torque and energy and power from a motor. And the motor in this is not spec'd for that. And you could say, \"Well, I can grind it very fine.\" \"And I actually pull shots of espresso \"with this and it works.\" The question is really, for how long? Now, you could argue if you burnt this out by using the wrong burrs, how would Fellow ever know? But the realistic scenario is not that you burn this out in three months and you're sending it back under warranty. The realistic outcome is that what should have lasted five to 10 years lasts two and it's still out of warranty, and you've just burned out your grinder much sooner than you needed to because you used the wrong burrs. It's not built for that, it's not spec'd for that. Now, I'm gonna have to interrupt myself here because literally hours after filming this video, Fellow started selling the SSP burrs on their website, which was kind of a surprise to me, a little bit and certainly not well-timed. But it is important to update this whole thing with some up-to-date thoughts and comments from Fellow themselves. Just to go back, a little tiny piece of history. So Fellow initially were kind of okay with you putting SSP burrs in. And then, not long after they launched the grinder, they were like, \"Actually, please, please don't do that.\" And I think they went and did some testing. And interestingly, you know, they're now saying, \"Yes, you can, \"and we'll even sell them to you.\" Now, this leaves me a little bit conflicted in a number of different ways. And first thing that I asked was, \"You say on the website you can't make espresso with it.\" Well, I can, and I have. I've pulled shots with this, and you can certainly grind fine enough. The steps are quite large in between, each adjustment and that's a problem, but ultimately you can go that fine and the website says you can't. I've got clarity there, you can, but you really shouldn't. Fellow was saying, \"Please don't pull shots of espresso with your grinder. \"It's not built for it, it's not spec'd for it. \"So in doing so, you will wear the motor \"and incur further risk of damaging your grinder.\" So even though it can, maybe don't. Actually, if it was me, what I would probably do is adjust my kind of burr setup and my dial setup so that I could never go that fine by accident, and therefore, never potentially damage my grinder, wear my motor, trigger a thermal cutout, all of that kind of stuff. Now, I did actually shoot a version of this interruption that had me pulling shots of espresso with it, but I'm not gonna include those really, because I don't wanna promote this thing, this idea that could result in you doing the same thing, testing it out and damaging your property, your grinder. So I think I will stand with Fellow and say, please don't do this. The fact that they're selling these burrs and promoting them, for me, is a little bit tricky. This motor is not spec'd for SSP burrs. It doesn't have the torque, it doesn't have the power, and grinding finer than usual, even finer than the previous burrs were spec'd will place additional strain on your motor. And I don't know at what point you damage the lifespan of a motor. I don't know whether you take its lifespan from say five to 10 years down to three. Then you're still gonna have a warranty issue regardless. It'll be out of warranty after that period of time. I don't think people are gonna kill their grinder in six months unless they're grinding huge amounts of coffee regularly through the day at very fine grind settings. But I do think there is a longevity piece here that is worth considering and should be built into your decision. And that's kind of the theme of this video that I'll bring up again and again. You should really just know what you're getting into and make an informed decision about using aftermarket parts on a grinder like this. One more thing before I hand you back to past me, you may have expected some taste-testing as part of this video. That really sort of fell outside of the brief of what I wanted to talk about today. Swapping burrs in and out and brewing is not a simple thing. And it's quite a difficult side-by-side test to do for a whole bunch of reasons. But there's no real debate that the SSP burrs produce a more uniform unimodal style grind. Whether you like that or not is perhaps different. But I think, certainly, at finer settings, or medium to fine settings, they are superior burrs to the ones that Fellow offer. At coarser settings, that's up for a bit of debate actually, but certainly finer, I think they're a better burr. A lot of people agree, the tests show more uniformity. And so it didn't seem within the brief of this particular topic. Anyway, that's enough from me. I'll hand you back to past me now to pick up where I left off. Now, the reason I have this grinder at the end here is that it's kind of interesting. This is a relatively new grinder and there'll be a full review in the next couple of months or so. In different places it has different names. It's called I think the G-Iota, the Solo in the UK. It's a flat burr grinder and it comes with options. In certain places, distributors are offering it with SSP or standard burrs. And there you would argue that that is spec'd for different burr sets. The motor is capable of different burr sets. And there, it's really about how you wanna spend your money. You're not incurring risk, you're not voiding warranties. And in that case, it's gonna be, what's the value of that upgrade to you? Now, if it's say, 100, 200 to upgrade a burr set inside a grinder at the point of manufacturer or before you buy it, I think that's a reasonable decision. I think upgrading the burr set can produce a more uniform grind, better tasting coffee. If you like that style of coffee, I think it is worthwhile. But as an aftermarket mod, you just really have to understand that you're incurring risk, and you will have potentially unintended consequences. Now, if you do wanna do it, generally speaking, changing out a burr set is incredibly easy. It depends on the grinder of course, but you know, you wanna access the burrs and change them out. Now, I've already changed the burr set inside this grinder and to do so is incredibly easy. So here you can see the SSP burr from inside the grinder. There's just three holes, and three screws holding this burr in place. This is the top and fixed burr. And to take it out is very simple. Just undo the screws, pull the piece out. Now, when you seat a new burr, it's very important that the surface it sits against is as clean as possible. If there's anything causing it to be at a slight angle, it will go out of alignment and it will not perform properly. And some people go so far as to check the alignment of their burr sets. I'll maybe link to a video down below about how to check alignments and do all that kind of stuff. It's a rabbit hole you can lose hours and hours of your life in, not always necessary. Now, if you look at the two burrs side-by-side, you can see not just the materials, but the shapes of the teeth are completely different. And I will say that while SSP appear to be leaders in the field, the broader understanding of exactly how teeth shape affect coffee is not widely understood. I think a lot of trial and error still goes into burr design and we're not yet truly at a point of understanding cause and effect when it comes to grinding coffee. But these teeth obviously have a much larger cutting area compared to these ones here. And that may explain how they are that much quicker. This grinds coffee about twice as quickly as it did before. And again, a combination of the material and the coating, as well as the teeth shape will affect the uniformity and the grind distribution. It seems a very simple and neat upgrade. And for the most part it is. And it's one that I would consider for many different grinders. And it's a great way to explore coffee. If you've got the budget, $200 for a set of burrs is expensive. It's a lot of money to throw at something. And it takes a grinder from being say a $300 grinder to a $500 grinder. And would I be happy with a $500 grinder that can't hold its griund setting? No, not really. Would I be happy with a $500 grinder that has an underpowered motor for how I might wanna ground coffee? No, for $500, I would expect more.", "videoID": "7QYlExoEpvA"}, {"title": "Is there a better way to reheat coffee\uff1f", "text": "Here's the question. Is there a better way to reheat coffee? I get this question a lot, a lot, a lot. People wanna know, \"I've let my coffee go cold. What should I do? Should I microwave it? Should I put it on the stove?\" What's the answer here? I have no idea. I've historically just given them the kind of party line of don't reheat your coffee. It makes it taste bad. And I know that is true. I know that if you get a jug of coffee and you leave it on a hot plate for half an hour, it tastes much, much, much worse. But I honestly don't know if there's a way of reheating coffee that tastes better. So here is what we're going to do. I'm gonna brew a big batch of coffee. I'm gonna split it into five different samples. Two of them, we're gonna try and maintain the temperature throughout using ways. Three of them, we're gonna let them go cold, and then we're gonna reheat them. And at the end of all of that, I'll do a blind tasting and see if one of them tastes better than the others. First things first, I need about a liter of coffee. I'm gonna have to brew a bit more than a liter of coffee because I need a liter of finished coffee. And I'll lose some to the grounds, so I'm gonna brew about 1.2 liters. I don't have a brewer that does that, so I'm gonna have to brew twice, and I'll blend them together so that we have one consistent beginning brew for our testing. Let me get on with that. And, hey, I get it. I am forgetful. I leave my coffee lying around all the time. Cold, cold coffee when you want a hot coffee, it's a wildly disappointing thing, so I get the urge to reheat it. I generally don't, but I always have coffee available. And should I really be telling people just to throw it away and make it again? I'm kind of hoping for an interesting result here, but who knows? Now, as I said, I don't have a big brewer, so I'm gonna have to brew two batches, which means this goes in here, and I brew as fast as I can. I know it's not ideal to brew twice and have it sit around, or half of it sit around, but it shouldn't invalidate the testing. Let's brew again. All right, second brew. Took me about five minutes to turn it around, a little bit less. So that's good. Now, here I've got five bowls. They've each got a number on the bottom to correspond to the way we're gonna heat them or reheat them or whatever we're gonna do, but that way I can't see what they are later on in the blind tasting. I'm gonna take three of those bowls and fill them with 200 grams of liquid and put them aside to go cold. Now, for the other two, we're not gonna use the bowls yet because this coffee's gonna go into two little vessels. First up is the Ember Mug. If you don't know the Ember Mug, I'll stick a link to a video up here. You can learn a bit more about it. It is expensive. It is a smart mug that requires firmware updates. It is able to keep your coffee at a perfect temperature for minutes on end. It is completely ridiculous. And worst of all, I love it. It's great. It's really nice to have a cup of coffee just held at the right kind of temperature so that when you go away and get distracted and come back, oh, it's just a moment of delight to find your coffee perfectly drinkable. I hate myself for how much I like this, but it is great. Now, I've set this a little bit hotter than I would usually because I want to be able to sort of transfer it into the bowl to a kind of nice drinking temperature. So I'm gonna hold it at around 60 degrees Celsius. My preferred drinking temperature is more like 54, should you wanna know those things. It's now powered up and ready to go, so I'll put 200 grams in. And this should hold its temperature for the next 30 minutes. And then we've got this thing. This is a classic little Thermos. I've had this one a long time. It's pretty dinged up, but it's an old technology. It's been around a good long while, but we know it works. And so now we wait for 30 minutes. Then we do some reheating, and then we do some tasting. What I'll do now is just have a quick taste of the last little bit left over, just to see what it was like fresh. I won't have this as a benchmark later on, but interesting nonetheless. Mm. So now that we've waited 30 minutes and these are all below body temperature now, they're all pretty cool, this room's quite cool, actually, now that it's winter, I need to work quite quickly to reheat each of these three in a different way. I'm gonna use two pretty classic methods and one kind of wildcard in all this. So first up, for this one here, we're gonna reheat this with a stove. We're gonna put it in a pan, heat it back up, probably around 70, 75. Obviously we're not gonna bring this to a boil. That would definitely be bad. But I feel like 75, 80, that's hot. It's too hot to drink again, but a kind of realistic way that many people probably reheat their coffee. Done. It's the trusty microwave. Now, a lot of people have weird anti-microwave issues. There's all sorts of like it ruins the nutrients in your food nonsense. If you are on that bandwagon, I'm open to a peer-reviewed study, but for now we're just gonna use this to reheat our coffee. Let's just give you, I don't know, 30 seconds. Perfect. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. Onwards. This last one's kind of a wildcard. I'm gonna use a steam wand to steam it hot again. Now, that is gonna cause one small issue, which is it's gonna dilute this a little bit more. When you steam milk, you'll generally add about 10% weight to the milk by steaming it from just the condensed steam. See what happens. This might be a problem for the blind tasting. It's a little bit foamy, but those bubbles should disappear. Maybe we'll skim 'em off, but now we've got obviously more coffee than we started with, so... Not too much more, actually. That's kind of interesting. And then back to the beginning. We have our Ember Mug, which has held it at around 57, 60 degrees Celsius. Gonna decant this in as neatly as I can. Got our friendly Thermos. And our three other bowls, one of which will need a little bit of preparation, just to make it look normal. I'll skim that with some cupping spoon. Hopefully the last few just dissipate away. So time for our blind tasting. I'm gonna go away. Michael's gonna come in and switch the bowls around so I don't know what's what. They should be similar temperatures, I presume. Now, while I do that, I'm going to go and tell you about our sponsor for this video. And having a sponsor means that there's a giveaway. There's a grinder giveaway. I'm giving away five Baratza grinders, five Baratza Encores to anyone who needs a grinder and can't afford one in any of the 39 countries that we can ship to. Life is tough right now, and I hope I can make five people's day a little bit better. And this is possible thanks to this video's sponsor that I'll tell you about right now, which is Surfshark. Surfshark is a fast, easy to use VPN service. They have apps for every platform, and actually they'll let you install it on unlimited devices with your account. That, I think, is a super cool feature. Now, VPNs day to day are useful for a couple of things. Firstly, it lets you access geo-restricted content. If you're in the U.K., you get a different menu on Netflix than you do in the U.S., and sometimes you wanna watch a show that isn't available to you straightaway. Or if I was traveling, I could be watching BBC iPlayer from anywhere in the world. Beyond that, a VPN offers you an extra layer of privacy online and also helps out preventing retailers offering you higher prices based on your location. It lets you shop around for the cheapest possible prices. If you wanna check it out, Surfshark are offering you a deal. It's 84% off and four extra months free if you head to surfshark.deals/jameshoffmann and use discount code JAMESHOFFMANN. Thank you to Surfshark for sponsoring this video. It is tasting time. I don't know what I've got here, but I'm curious. Now, the theory would be that the hotter you hold coffee, the more it's gonna degrade. The hotter you make coffee, the more it's gonna degrade. That's why if you hold coffee in a glass pot on a heater at 90 degrees Celsius, you cook it, and it tastes terrible. Can the Ember get away with holding it at a lower temperature? Does the Thermos work because it's not pulling heat out the same way, rather than there's no additional heat being kinda put in? I don't know, let's see if there's any difference in taste between all of these. Okay, I'm gonna immediately rule one out 'cause it just tastes weird. It's got this introduction of this whole other kind of weird taste that kind of reminds me of papery caramel. And I know that doesn't sound entirely awful, but it's definitely weird and wrong. It's got this artificial sweetness that's just very confusing. That's just really weird. That's really weird. I'm just gonna say you're out for now. You're not the best one here. This is difficult. We're into nuance here. I really thought the differences would be more pronounced. I think I'm gonna kick this one out for being a bit more harsh and kind of bitter. I'm also, just on kind of bitterness alone, I think you're out. I'm so nervous about what I'm picking. What if I endorse heating it on a pot on a stove? Okay, I'm also gonna, I'm gonna kick that one, I think. This is very stressful. What if this is something ridiculous? Oh, interesting, the winner was number one, which I think was the Ember Mug. So that's spent the least time being hot. It was held at 60 degrees Celsius. It was never heated above that. Sort of cooled to that temperature and sat there. And it just had a little bit less bitterness and a little bit less harshness than the other cups here. This one here, number five. Oh. Wait, number five was the steam wand. This is a little bit embarrassing. At the end of the edit of this video, we realized that I had made a massive mistake. I'd managed to switch around the labels underneath the bowls for the three reheated brews. Thankfully, we captured the mixing up of the bowls on video and were able to work out what was what. I'll just give you a quick summary now of the truth of all of this thing because if you listen to me talk about which one is which, I get it all wrong. And I'm pretty confused, but I get it all wrong. What on Earth were you? Number three. Let me tell you the ranking of the reheating. Last place, steaming it. It had this really funny taste. I described it as kind of a papery caramel. It just tasted a bit odd. It might've been the residual water from the steam boiler. I don't know, but it just wasn't good-tasting. Second place of the reheating methods was the hob. I described it as being a little bit more bitter than the others, and that wasn't good either. In fact, the best of the reheating turned out to be the microwave. I'll speculate now that it was done that way because I pulsed it in two or three sort of small heating sessions up to just the right temperature. It never got overheated, and it was a gentle heating method. So of the reheating methods, in my experience, in truth, the microwave did a little bit better than the others. The ultimate conclusion of the video is still correct, and so for that I'll hand you back to past me to explain. This was not an exhaustive scientific test, but it was pretty interesting, and the differences are not as big as I expected, but they are definitely there. The Thermos isn't a bad choice, but ultimately holding coffee at a cooler temperature, at a drinking temperature seems to preserve its taste better. Now, unfortunately, this does continue the narrative of my coffee went cold, how should I heat it back up, the answer mostly being don't. But mostly, if you can, don't let it go cold. Drink it warm. Keep it warm. A Thermos is a good way to go. Something that holds it a little bit cooler is maybe a way to go. Now, one of my issues with Thermoses is that they do keep the coffee almost too hot to drink. I get annoyed if I'm half an hour from home and I still can't drink my coffee, so I often brew onto an ice cube or two. That might be scandalous, I don't know, but it works for me. It's easy, it brings it down to a nice drinking temperature, and it holds it there. So again, might be a good way to go for you. There are more and more Thermos-style cups available on the market. I think about the one from Fellow off the top of my head that springs to mind, but there are others available too. But interestingly, the Ember performed really well. An interesting test. I would say hold your coffee at drinking temperature and no hotter.", "videoID": "yqgKlqAUM9g"}, {"title": "\uff02Coffee Expert\uff02 Reacts to Brad Pitt's Weird Coffee Commercial", "text": "Today, we're gonna have a look at the new commercial for De'Longhi, with Brad Pitt in it, which is a really weird commercial. Like, it's really weird. I know I don't usually do react style videos, but when you have a company this big partnering with a movie star that big to say something about coffee, to communicate something about coffee, I think that's kind of interesting. Now, as you look at the commercial, we're going to watch it in a second, you can see just a big old blue anamorphic lens flare. This video was shot, was directed by Damien Chazelle, who directed \"La La Land\" and his kind of primary cinematographer is a guy called Linus Sandgren, who is a Swedish guy, and he's also in this too. And I think the music is done by the guy that composed for \"La La Land,\" a guy called Justin Hurwitz. So, a kind of dream team, who also just happen to be making a movie called \"Babylon\" with Brad Pitt right now. So, an element of convenience here, I guess, maybe, they're all kinda hanging out together. Why not spend a day and make a commercial for a bean-to-cup coffee machine? That seems normal. Now it's a pretty short commercial. It's like 60 seconds long. I'm gonna interrupt it a ton, I apologize for that, 'cause a lot of it just asks more questions than I have answers for. You know what I mean? There's a lot of weird stuff to me in this commercial. Now some of it's a bit nitpicky. I'm not gonna get all CinemaSins about this, but some stuff in here bothers me from a kind of continuity perspective. Anyway, let's start watching it. It'll make more sense. Now I kinda feel like the whole like motorcycle coffee thing, that particular trope is a little tired. Like we did the whole like, guys who are really into motorbikes being really into coffee and beards and that kind of thing. I feel like that particular trope within coffee, I'm not saying you can't enjoy coffee if you like a motorcycle, I'm just saying that trope is kind of done. And it's kind of interesting that this is more about like a Brad Pitt slice of life. This is how Brad lives his day and he wants you to know he rides a motorbike very well. Casually, see, just one hand. Now, straight into the coffee bit, which is very exciting for me. He's buying some coffee beans. Into a delightful kraft paper bag, you know what I mean? He's having a little artisan experience. He's like, \"No, just give me some weird American weight of coffee,\" half a kilo for the rest of us. But this for me, it brings us to one of the great bizarre decisions of this commercial. So, he gets his coffee and he puts it down. And, this is just weird, right? Yes, if you go to Starbucks and you order a drink, they might ask you a name and they'd put your name on the cup and then write underneath, what your order is, because they're busy and they wanna make sure you get the right drink. And you can't just look at a cup and know what it is. So, for some reason, the guy has written Brad's name on the bag of coffee. There's no one else here, there's no one else in the line. It's not a busy place. He's just written Brad's name, which in the world of celebrities, they're not, they're not always super into that, you know what I mean? They're not into like, \"Oh, hi Brad. We're friends now 'cause you buy coffee from me.\" That's that's not always the vibe, sometimes the vibe, but not always the vibe. What I love even more, than writing his name on it for no good reason whatsoever, is what he's written underneath. Now it's hard to see in the video what he's written, thankfully, all of the the kind of images for the websites and that kind of stuff, well they've photoshopped it to make it very clear. It says \"Fresh coffee beans\". Someone thinks someone else is an idiot. Now it could be that the guy behind the bar, thinks Brad's an idiot and he might take this unmarked brown paper bag and be genuinely confused about what's inside, despite the fact that he went and bought it, because fresh coffee beans is not useful information, is it? It's not what the coffee is. It's not like house espresso or like a nice Kenyan coffee or some estate name. It's just \"Fresh coffee beans\". You would never write that on the side of a bag of coffee, never ever. It's like you'd write \"Cup of coffee\" on the side of a cup of coffee. You just wouldn't do it. It might be more likely that they think you, the audience, is an idiot and you wouldn't know what this was, despite the fact that you watched the coffee beans go in the bag, you'd still be confused by what this brown paper bag that Brad has bought is full of. It's just a really lazy, weird decision that kind of should be a singular moment, that just goes away, right? Like they made a one decision and it goes away, but it doesn't go away. It gets even weirder. Brad's very happy. Now, William Bradley Pitt, your net worth is like $300 million. I'm confident that you can afford a bag that fits your bag of coffee inside it, that it doesn't leave the bit with your name, sticking out the back. What are you doing? You could have just put it in a different way. What else is in your bag? 'Cause you don't go and buy pastries, and as one of cinema's greatest eaters, I'm kind of disappointed that you don't eat anything in this commercial with your coffee, but that's beside the point. Why, why has he got the top of the bag stuck out of his bag as he rides away?  Now, this scene is the most confusing to me by far. What exactly is happening here? It looks like Brad has gone to sit, bored, full of ennui, in a kind of regal pose. And what's kind of more upsetting to me is that the guy working on the motorbike is drinking a cup of coffee. Brad is not. Brad passive-aggressively has left his bag of coffee, poking out of his bag as if to say, \"Oh no, I like coffee, I just don't like your coffee.\" I mean, there are mugs behind him just left kind of casually lying around, but on the table next to him, where he would have a cup of coffee, no, no, no. His bag, pride of place, look at this, \"Look at my bag of beans, for me, I don't want your filth, it's not from a De'Longhi.\" But even just the vibe of like, Brad spends his day in the corner of a shop, watching a dude work on his bike for him while looking kind of bored, that's a, it's just like a really weird scene. I just don't understand why this is there. There's no down-to-earth Brad here. There's no, hey-I'm-a-normal-guy Brad, it's a, I'm gonna watch you work on my motorbike and I'm gonna be bored by it. This, he's back on the bike, this kind of bothers me because, what time of day is this? Now, this is California and conveniently the west coast of America, we know where the water is in terms of, you know, directions. And we know that the sun over the water, as we regularly see here, means that the sun is setting. It's the evening time. It's kind of constantly the evening time, except it's not, which bothers me. So this particular shot, it's nearly evening. The sun's relatively high, but coming down. But that seems to change just randomly all the time and shout out to the colourist who had to work, I suspect very hard to make this vaguely coherent throughout. Anyway, Brad is off, again for no reason, to pump some gas. Now, again, this scene maybe suggests that Brad is an everyman, Brad pumps his own gas. Brad has some gloves that he really wants you to see, but, but more than that, they pull focus onto the bag with his name on it, again, they're like, \"Look, he's still got the coffee.\" He's still carrying it around unnecessarily in a bag that he could clearly fit comfortably inside. He has left it poking out so that people around the gas station, what, they know it's Brad? As if they couldn't tell who this handsome man is, why is this shot there? That's, it's, anyway. So Brad, he's got his gas, very casually rides home, sun quite low, very long shadows. Except when he gets home, it's now kind of the middle of the afternoon again. What time is it? Now this, this is great. Gets his bag out. They couldn't get a shot, they couldn't get a shot, where the beans don't just kind of bounce out in pieces and make a mess on his counter. I think that's kind of amazing. They just didn't care or couldn't be bothered. They were like, \"No, one shot, pour the beans in, bits can go everywhere.\" The best news here, is that Brad makes I think a good decision. He goes for the cappuccino mix. Now you and me, we've probably never ordered a cappuccino mix, 'cause we've never had a machine like this. The cappuccino mix, just means that the, the kind of coffee goes in first, then the milk on top. And so then mixed together. You'll see, I think later in this commercial, you can go the other way around with these machines and have like the layered latte macchiato type thing, if you wanna do that. But, the connoisseur's choice is to have the fully mixed beverage. And that's what Brad goes for. I do enjoy that this is his face of anticipation, kind of mild confusion or disgust. I don't quite know what it is. He looks unsettled by what's happening. He doesn't look appetized, but, but that'll happen in a minute, I guess. And so Brad gets his cappuccino. Lordy, he's a vascular man and he has an evening cappuccino, which apparently is best described by De'Longhi themselves as, Perfetto so there we have, you can see like a little espresso, a little latte macchiato, and Brad's apparently still full bag of fresh coffee beans. Fresh coffee beans, they're so proud of that. It's on all the, it's on all the kind of images on the website and stuff. Super, super weird. And that's, that's Brad Pitt's coffee commercial. I don't understand it. I know that the very top line here is like Brad Pitt, he's Brad Pitt and he has a De'Longhi, so you should get a De'Longhi. I get that, that's kind of the big message of the ad, I get that, but the way that they've done it, to me, just makes no sense. I find it a really confusing set of decisions. And I'm aware, saying this publicly to you, maybe some of you see these decisions and are like, \"No, no, that makes total sense. Of course they would write \"Fresh coffee beans\" because no shop ever has done that ever in the history of ever. No, no, no, they would totally write that.\" It makes no sense.", "videoID": "Nvlh8Bh-QQA"}, {"title": "The Best Espresso Machines Under \u00a3100", "text": "Can you get good espresso with a machine under a 100 pounds? Something you hear coffee people say all the time, is that the Grinder is way more important than the espresso machine And if you gave them a really good grinder and really cheap espresso machine They'd make better espresso than if they had a great machine and a cheap grinder What I want to know is just how cheap you can go in the espresso machine If you've got a good grinder and still get something drinkable Here are five different espresso machines each under 100 pounds and one good level grinder starting here with the Swan Retro. That was 90 pounds the DeLonghi is the most expensive of the bunch at $99.99 scraping in by a penny. The Krups 90 pounds. The AmazonBasics 65 pounds That's... that's really cheap But not as cheap as the Andrew James, which came in at 60 pounds. When you buy an expensive coffee machine, you're buying precision consistency and control That is not present. I suspect on any of these things. One more little frustration, Is that four of these five machines have what are called pressurized Porta filters. Now, these are portafilters designed Presuming that you at home can't grind coffee and you're probably buying coarsely ground pre-ground coffee Typically, pressurized portafilters work well with coarsely ground coffee, they don't make particularly good tasting coffee But they do make fluffy fluffy crema most of the time I'll see if I can hack my way around them. We'll see what we can do to get the best out of them First up is the Swan. The build Cheap, plastic everywhere. Two of the buttons when you push them They stay depressed in, suggesting that they are on. Except the power button, which doesn't do that, which is confusing The temperature gauge seems nice, but goes in 40 degrees Celsius increments But, it is not particularly stable in terms of temperature. It has a pressurized portafilter We've got this additional piece screwed to the bottom and it has a little extra filter inside it I don't know why this is there. I don't like it It also has a little rubber gasket inside the brew basket. I don't want rubber inside my brewing environment I'm just not a fan of that. So can this pull good espresso? Loading this is not much fun. I think you're supposed to use the spoon it comes with Which is a shape that makes me slightly Uncomfortable. And at the bottom of this is a tamper, which I would say is deeply unpleasant to use It takes about 12 grams in the portafilter, and the best shots that I got out, were about 40 grams of liquid But pretty fast shots too. You might get some nice fluffy crema But the coffee itself tastes Fine but a bit dull. If you try and pull a \"normal\" shot Let's say 12 in 30 grams out in 28 seconds It tastes very weak, very hollow, very empty Something goes wrong in the brewing process and I don't really understand what it is. But it just doesn't work It seems like pressurized portafilters Especially in this one don't like finely ground coffee, slow traditional espresso. If you were going to turn this into a milk drink Maybe it would be okay, but in terms of good espresso No, I could not get good espresso from this coffee machine Next up is the DeLonghi now. This was the most expensive of the five and it does come with a proper basket This means that I can put properly ground, finely ground coffee into it It means that I in theory could make good espresso. This basket sits in a very annoying way in this portafilter. It drops in some little tabs lined up and it sits inside But it will always just fall out So like all the other porterfilters, it has this little flip thing to hold it in place when you knock it out That is very unpleasant as an experience. The machine itself is also...oof A challenge you have a ready light and that's it. There's no gauge. There's no information there You just have to hope that you're getting a good temperature. It's very noisy the whole machine shakes It doesn't feel particularly well built. The design of the interior of this makes it very easy for liquid to be retained inside the portafilter. That over time will dry, crust on That's a weird little design flaw. The tamper on this thing is mounted to the machine. Ergonomically, that's a mess I don't like having to put my hand on top of a wall mesh machine to push down again. So I'll pull something pretty traditional 14 in 28 to 30 grams out in about 25 to 30 seconds. Somewhere in that ballpark is what I think we'll get Yeah, okay it's okay for $99.99 If you're willing to put in the effort, you might get some okay results. The shots looked good, tasted okay Good espresso, not great espresso is possible here next up is the Krups and this cost 90 pounds just like the Swan the first one we looked at and the portafilter is identical and so I thought This was going to be a bit of dejavu. Oh wait you thought I was gonna say dejabrew? but I didn't because I don't hate you on me This current made good coffee for one simple reason the way that it disperses water from the group head is all messed up I don't know if I have a defective machine or if this is common to all of them But let's brew some coffee anyway 12 grams is really all it can take and like this one, it does come with your little tamper scoop thing. This one's a bit more charming It could have a little Pixar movie about it one day but still broadly unpleasant Now this growing setting is the same one that I used for the DeLonghi so with a proper basket. The grind setting doesn't really matter here because most of the water is going to go through a giant hole in the middle of the puck That jet of water Digs a hole in the coffee and creates a massive channel. You cannot have an even extraction here That smells bad No, that's just that's extreme channel flavor where it's hollow and it's empty and it's sour and it's bitter It's just disgusting No So now the AmazonBasics espresso machine. Amazon will have watched closely to see what people are searching for, see what they're buying Then they'll get their own version of that thing done and just push it to the top of the search rankings Cut to the front of the line and capture the sale This machine seems in many ways almost identical to the Krups But they've just made it cheaper. This little dial is cheap and awful The whole machine actually just bends. And it has the same problem as the Krups. Once you get up to, you know High temperatures inside the machine, you get this jet of steam that punches out aggressively into the coffee and you get channeling and it makes terrible tasting coffee. Now, with both the Krups and this one you probably if you cared enough Could pull enough cold water through it that you bring the temperature of the unit down? You see the coffee already like go off and try and catch it before it overheats But I still would say it's not worth your time and effort. This is just like pulling shots with the Krups It digs the same giant hole in the coffee. It is a waste of time. It is a waste of money It makes me very sad that this was built in the first place Thanks Jeff. So we end with the Andrew James 60 pounds. What do you get for your money? you get a power light that never comes on ,you get a heating light that never goes off, you get a quite a drip your little group head, but it does at least distribute water properly and quite gently However, like many other machines it's a pressurized portafilter. There's no fancy extras here There's just a little pinprick hole underneath the basket. As for coffee, It's about what you'd expect at this point in the video It doesn't make very good coffee It wants you to pull those coarse-ground faster longer shots, because it's a pressurized portafilter. If you try and brew something slower with a finer grind a more akin to real espresso, it will disappoint you. I struggled to make coffee with it I didn't really enjoy it. But to talk more about it, feels like I'm rehashing two or three of the machines, We've already talked about. Would I recommend spending 60 pounds on this? No, I would not. To wrap things up Let's answer the two big questions that I have at the end of this The first one is the easy one. If I had a 100 pounds to spend on a coffee machine to make something like espresso Which one of these would I buy, and the answer is very easy The DeLonghi was head and shoulders above the rest. simply because it didn't have a pressurized portafilter It was frustrating and cheap and plasticky and Inconsistent, but it was the best of these ones tested by a long way But the second question, I think is more important. If I have a 100 pounds Is that enough money to buy a good espresso machine? And for me the answer is no while you can get some ok coffee out of the DeLonghi, it will be frustrating and finicky and he won't particularly enjoy the experience of making coffee every morning. I would hold off I would wait. I would save a little bit more I think it's worth spending more money to get something better down the line. In future I plan to look at a load of different machines and try and find what I think is the bare minimum to have good espresso at home Not just good tasting espresso But to have an experience to have a hobby of espresso making that you actually enjoy As much as the drinks themselves. That I think is really super important if espresso at home is gonna be a thing That is a regular part of your life. Otherwise, these things just become late-night impulse purchases Oh, I kind of like the idea of coffee I pick one of those up use it for a week or two and into the cupboard it goes Never to come back out again.", "videoID": "avM-XsaTBIc"}, {"title": "Shockingly Delicious Espresso Pucks", "text": "Now, be honest with me. You ever make an espresso and it's a really good espresso, right? But afterwards you knock out your puck and you look at the puck. Maybe you pick it up. And it looks delicious, right? Like it looks tasty. Are you ever tempted to maybe take a bite?  Welcome to something a little bit silly. Today we're gonna try and recreate the look, feel, size, shape of a spent espresso puck, the coffee after you've finished brewing, and see if we can make that delicious. Because why not? Because it looks like it should be and it should be so let's just do it. Now, your first thought might be like my first thought, which is like, just do a chocolate shortbread. And I thought, yeah, but no. The first thing that I wanna try is actually edible soil, chocolate, dirt, whatever you wanna call it. It's kind of a thing you see on kind of modernist menus. Now, I know soil doesn't look like coffee, but I think it could. So I'm gonna try to make some. And there's two different techniques. I'm going to try them both one after the other. We'll compare them, see which one might make for the better spent ground coffee replacement. So here's the first recipe. So for this method, we're gonna take 100 grams of sugar, just 70 grams of water, and very carefully turn that into a syrup. As it starts to brown, we're gonna whisk in 70 grams of good quality dark chocolate, and keep whisking and whisking and whisking, then turn it out and let it cool. So what I wanna do now is get it down to like a finer texture. So I'm gonna sift out with just a regular sieve any of the sort of finer pieces, cause they're good enough. And then the big chunky pieces, I'm gonna throw into a blender, grind them down a little bit more really quickly and then sift through that until we have a pretty fine ground powder, like espresso. So the second recipe, very easy. You can do it almost all in the blender, then you do have to melt some butter first. Anyway, you need 220 grams of sugar, 120 grams of cocoa powder, add a pinch of salt. And then blend this a little bit just to mix it all up. And then with it running, you're just gonna drizzle in the melted butter and combine it all together. Pretty simple. So we've got two very different edible dirts, two potential contenders for ground coffee. Now, the color on the first one doesn't look quite as spent coffee puck, right? The color on this one just has a bit more of that kind of wet coffee feel to it and that's the butter doing that. Lets have a little taste though. Quite Sandy in a good way. That's not a phrase I thought I'd use. Like crunchy, nice chocolate flavor. Very pleasant. Let's try the second soil. Much soilier looking. I don't love the taste of this one because it's dominated by the cocoa powder. And for technical reasons that aren't worth going into right now, really high quality cocoa powder that matches the quality of craft chocolate is pretty much impossible to come by. It's certainly very difficult to come by. I've used a more commercial product here and I just taste it. It doesn't taste as good in terms of flavor as this here. Now, the second, all important test, will it puck? So I've got a little basket here or seminary basket. I'm just gonna fill it reasonably, and we'll give it a little tamp. Now, let me get my  mat. Just throw it on here cause I'm not 100% convinced this is going to bind nicely. Ooh, it's like a little puck. Okay? Number two. I mean, this has gotta puck, right? A little tamp. Now, that doesn't look quite as good, but it looks like it's holding together better. Can I.. No. If you knock out a puck before you brew it, it's like this. You can't pick it up. It's like ground coffee that hasn't been brewed yet. This picks up. I don't wanna get into baking these things for reasons I'll get into in a second, but definitely the butter is playing an important role here. I think we might be able to get the best of both worlds. What I'm gonna try and do is just work through into this. What I've got here of the first one, a little bit of butter. I'm gonna melt a little bit of butter. I'm gonna work it into it and see if it'll add that kind of binding agent, especially once I've cooled it down a little bit. So let's give that a try. So to get things close, I've taken the ratio of butter to other stuff from the second recipe, I'm gonna add it in to the first recipe and see what happens. I probably should be doing it in the blender. That'd be sensible, but I'll do it by hand cause I'm not smart. So reasonably incorporated. Let's have a little taste. In a surprise to exactly no one, taking something delicious and adding butter is delicious. Will it puck?  Now, that looks, oh, so close. Pretty good. It's still a bit crumbly. So what I'm wondering is what if a chill this down? I'm gonna form up a couple of these and just chill them down in the fridge for a little bit and see what that does to the texture. So these have had a chance to chill. I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little bit nervous. I don't know why. I want this to work. I want this to be ridiculous. Wish me luck. So close. So close, but it's too crumbly. We're so nearly there. A little bit more to go. A few things to tweak. I've got some ideas, but I just love where your curiosity can take you.

Should we have a little taste of our recreated espresso puck? I want this one. Cheers. It's pretty good. It's pretty good. Holding together really nicely. Taste is pretty great. Let me tell you how to make these. First thing is make coffee butter. Now, we've made coffee butter before in the ultimate kind of coffee cake recipe. Two parts butter to one part coffee. So 100 grams of butter and 50 grams of coffee. Let it steep and infuse on a very low heat for about an hour and strain it out. Next thing is to make the edible soil. So it's 100 grams of sugar and 30 grams of water. Heat that in a pan until at 135 degrees Celsius. That's the point as the syrup just starts to brown. Do not take it further. Throw in the chocolate, whisk aggressively, and soon you'll have a kind of soil in the pan. Scrape it out, cool it down and then actually clean the pan. Best thing to do is throw some hot water in, a little detergent and bring it back to the boil, and all that chocolate that looks pretty baked on will come right off. Once your soil is cool, we're gonna blend it to make it as fine as possible. So into the blender, run it for a little bit just to pulverize it down. Now, if you wanna go to extremes, you can sift it to get a really fine texture. And if you really wanna go a little bit too far, that stuff that won't sift, you could put it in a Comandante and grind it at a very fine setting, but that might make you weird. Anyway, the results are pretty good. So you've got your very fine kind of ground coffee looking thing. Wave that. Now, I had about 140 grams, and that's gonna tell us how much butter to use. So I multiply by .23 and that's how much butter you need, but that's gonna include a little bit of chocolate. So I needed 30 grams of butter, but I substituted five grams of that for five grams of chocolate. This just helps set the whole thing up at the end. It means we don't really have to bake it and it will stick together. At this point, I added five grams of cocoa powder and a gram and a half of the salt. Gently incorporate that kind of warm chocolate butter into the edible soil, stir it all together and you've got everything you need for a delicious little biscuit. We're gonna form these in double baskets, and make sure it's nice and clean, like fully clean, clean, clean, and then heap it in there, tamp it down. Sorry to the tamper. And then if you're feeling like you want the real attention to detail, well, I chose to use a screen and a screw just to add a little realism to the top of my puck. Knock them out into a little freezer proof bag. I just like to keep them that way in case I wanna chill them quickly, or you can just knock them onto a plate to put in the fridge. They're gonna need maybe two hours in the fridge to fully set up and be ready to go. And at the end of it, you've got this delicious little espresso puck. Now, I used an espresso roast in my coffee butter because I wanted just like a little tickle of bitterness cause it is quite sweet, right? It's ultimately quite a sweet thing. And I wanted to offset that with a little saltiness, a little bitter, a little sweet, a little kind of sugary, good time.", "videoID": "nRuNL6idNfI"}, {"title": "The 9Barista Espresso Machine Review", "text": "Hi there. Today we're going to be talking about this. It's the 9Barista Espresso Machine. It's like a stove top mako pot that actually makes espresso. This was created by a guy called William Playford. His background is a jet engineer. That's his bonafides. It's beautiful. And it's very clever. It has three pieces. The top one, probably the least interesting. We'll come back to that in a second. The main body is two parts. One of which is a water chamber at the bottom. Initially, you might think this looks just like the base of a moka pot. There's a pressure release valve, necessary and safe but it's more than that. It's actually two water chambers. And this is the first point at which this thing is pretty clever. Now you'd fill this with about 110 to 120 mils of water. Cold water as recommended by the manufacturer. And while I like to use boiled water in a moka pot, I've done as they've asked in this case here but all of the clever things are here in this part, in the middle. Now you'll see that this little piece has two little red gaskets here and they are what divide the two chambers. So when you screw it in, there is a chamber below this gasket. And one above this gasket. The bottom chamber is where water is boiled and it's trapped until it reaches very high pressures until it reaches nine bars of pressure. I think that's about 179 degrees Celsius but I could be wrong. The upper chamber here is quite clever. It's going to act as a cooling bath. This is gonna be confusing when I tell you that the water in that cooling bath is gonna be 100 degrees Celsius or it's going to be at whatever temperature water boils wherever you are. Here, I'm at sea level so it's 100 degrees Celsius. The way this thing works is that you have this water trapped, boiling away madly in the bottom section. When it reaches nine bars of pressure, it opens a spring release valve inside this unit allowing water to flow into this coil. Now this coil is surrounded, it's jacketed by this boiling water, which is much, much, much cooler than the water going into that tube is. It's kept at 100 degrees Celsius because this chamber is only at atmospheric pressure. There's a little chimney here on the side that allows water to sort of boil, thus keeping it at a fixed temperature. In flowing through this coil, it should drop from 179 down to about 100 degrees Celsius, it's still a little bit hot, before entering the final section of this part of the body which is an additional heat sink. That's what these fins are for. Therefore it should exit the shower screen effectively at about 93, 94 degrees Celsius. That's the theory. What you have on top is basically an upside down portafilter. I mean, it's exactly a portafilter. There's a basket here, it comes out. There's a little handle, it's a portafilter. But by having it upside down, the pressure comes from underneath, it's dispersed through a little dispersion block that sits on top of the coffee, I'll show you that in a minute, and then flows into this little collection chamber where you pour it out and drink your espresso at the end of it. It's ingenious, to be honest, it's a fascinating solution to the problem of how do I generate nine bars of pressure on a stove top? We'll brew some coffee, taste it, talk about it. And then afterwards, I'll give you my overall thoughts about how this works and ultimately, who is this for? So I have everything amongst this chaotic collection of things in which I need to make espresso with the 9Barista. Now, when you buy it, it comes with this. It's an adapter desk for gas or induction. So this on its own does not work on an induction hub. So I've got a small little gas burner here and it works for these as well just to disperse the heat a bit more evenly and make it so it fits safely on top of any sized ring. It does also come with a very cute little tamper, which is nice and obviously necessary. So let's make some coffee in here. I have my cold filtered, delicious water, a little bit below the suggested level for reasons we'll talk about in a second. Now, when you put this together, you'll see this becomes submerged and the water begin to cover this section of the chamber. If you overfill, you will make a mess. With anything where you're going to be generating high pressures, you want to make sure your gaskets are properly seated so this is nice and tight. Don't make it impossible to undo later. You won't thank yourself for that, but make sure it's tight. So now to prep the basket. Now they recommend 20 grams of coffee. That's probably a pretty good catch-all dose, but for me I certainly prefer slightly lower doses. So I'm kind of in that 18 and a half, 19 range with this, I think it's 'cause the coffee I'm using is perhaps a touch lighter and therefore a little bit harder to extract. And as we know from the video on starting dose for espresso dialing in, which is up here if you want to watch that, then if you have a lighter roast that it helps sometimes to use a lower dose. And tamp. One last piece to go on is this sort of dispersion screen that does two jobs, it disperses water and also keeps the coffee in when you turn it upside down, both fairly important things. Lock in the group head and we're ready to make some coffee. Now, the one challenge of this unit, I suppose is that the dialing in process if you're trying to brew coffee after coffee after coffee, after coffee, it's pretty slow, actually. Their ideal brew time from going on from cold is six minutes. And you kind of want to hit that brew time. So brewing back to back, certainly when you get the unit for the first time, it's gonna take a little while to really kind of dial in your process. And that six minute time is kind of important, actually. If you miss it then a couple of bad things can happen. You can either potentially evaporate all of the water in your upper chamber because it will boil. You could boil it so dry that you end up insufficiently cooling your brewing water and having an aggressive, steamy brew. I've certainly done that when trying to find that kind of right heat setting for this particular unit. You kind of want to work out and tweak and aim for a six minute brew by testing. You're gonna make some bad coffee when you get this. You're unlikely to nail it out of the gate. If you did well, well done you. You're aiming for six minutes and the trouble with that in some ways as part of the dialing in process, is that you don't know if it's gone wrong until you get to six minutes and nothing's happened, right? If you're heating it too slowly, at six minutes you find out things have gone wrong. That's a bit frustrating for me. The dialing in process has definitely been a little bit too slow and sort of drawn out. And then you've got to cool it down, take it to pieces, refill it. It's not a back-to-back unit. And certainly, it's not going to be great at producing lots of coffee for lots of different people quite quickly. This is something that you buy for you. So now we're starting to hear some boiling and that boiling is the upper chamber. This is where I've had a couple of issues and it's an issue that they know about. And we'll talk a little bit about the fix afterwards but that bubbling can be a little bit too angry, a little bit too intense. It coincides typically with the unit really coming up to pressure and coffee happening as long as you've got the heat right. And at this point, you kinda want to pay attention to what's going on. You can have some issues with water spitting out of the chamber which is obviously bad, but coffee is now happening. And it looks very good. I have made some espresso. Oh yeah. So let's taste it in a second. I'm just gonna put this in the sink, cool it down a little bit. So how is it? Did it make delicious coffee? Well it's pulled a decent size double. It had some nice crema. It's pretty good, it tastes like the coffee that went in. Texture's nice. You don't need to stir the shot because it's been stirred by that kind of pouring action out of the 9Barista. It would certainly work well as the base of a milk drink if that's what you were interested in doing, though obviously it has no method for heating milk. As a straight shot though, pretty good. I might drop the dose, tweak the grind a touch finer. It's on the border of under extracted, but that's on me and not on the machine so to speak. Ultimately, it makes good tasting coffee. It's certainly capable of producing the temperature and the pressure that you would want. It doesn't taste like a super hot shot. You know what I mean? When brew temperatures have gone a little bit too high, it doesn't have that particular kind of harsh bitterness that you get sometimes. Pressure wise, it's hard to really know. The physics, all that kind of stuff behind it certainly make sense but I have no way of measuring that effectively so there's a bit of trust there. What I will say is that it needs a slightly courser grind than a traditional espresso machine for the same kind of dose to flow normally, which suggests possibly a slightly lower pressure. It might be that the shot starts at nine bars but obviously as pressure is released from the system, that pressure may decline towards the end of the shot. In order for this to appeal to you, I think what you need is very limited space. It is a good grinder for sure. And no interest in milk drinks. It's 295 pounds, which is expensive. You can see where your money is going in terms of design and build. It's a small company, but I think that's probably a fair price to achieve what they've achieved here but it's still more expensive than some traditional kind of lever machines. Something like the Flair where, you know, you're going to be adding the hot water and the pressure yourself. This is at least doing some of those things for you and doing it in a controlled, repeatable way. If you have a moka pot that you wished made espresso, this is for you, but just you. Again, it's not good at making multiple coffees for multiple people and it doesn't work particularly quickly. But if you wish you could put on a moka pot in the morning, have a genuinely delicious espresso at the end of it, this may be something for you to consider. That doesn't mean I'm not without some small criticisms of it. It's a very well machined thing. It seems to be done within very tight tolerances. Though, I will say that locking in the portafilter, there's just a little bit too much play here as you lock it in. I wish it was a little bit more tightly machined from that perspective. I've never had an issue with a seal not forming properly. It just doesn't feel in line with the rest of the machine as a whole. It's just a funny little detail like that. I do need to talk about the issue with water exiting the chimney towards the end of the brew or towards the beginning of espresso flowing. They've addressed this in a blog post. If you're getting very large bubbles of water, it's because you potentially lack nucleation points. Inside here where the water is boiling in that secondary chamber, everything's too smooth. They discovered quite recently that if you just sand a little bit just to rough up some of the surfaces in there, that issue goes away which I think is kind of interesting. And also they've had people just use a little bit less than 120 mil inside of the machine, more like 110, and had no issues either. As you saw, I had a little tiny issue, but not a significant one. I haven't done any roughing up inside of here. I think they're going to change that for future production runs. This is number 278, so it's still pretty early there but I'm glad they addressed an issue and I'm glad they've worked out the problem and got a fix for it even if it is something as simple as a piece of sandpaper. The last criticism or thing to note is that you don't have a ton of control here. It's gonna do what it's gonna do. You're not gonna be able to manipulate pressure or temperature in any way. And if you like coffees that brew with ideal temperatures that are outside of the kind of range it produces, there's not much you'll be able to do. I guess you could probably try something inadvisable like dosing a little cold water in to sort of drop the temperature of the heat jacket just before it starts brewing. But the timing on that seems like a chaotic thing and I'm certainly not recommending that. I'm just sort of thinking out loud. As fixed as it is, it at least does the things that it's supposed to do. It produces consistent temperature and pressure and it does it in an ingenious, clever, and frankly, beautiful way. The details on this are nice. The wood handles are nice, it feels solid. It feels well built. It does have a couple of gaskets in there. And to be honest, I did break one of them. I'm not sure how, it's not shocking. I can perhaps be a little bit rough with equipment at times. I'm not like Casey Neistat with cameras, but you know, I might be a little bit rough sometimes. Just be aware that there are parts that will wear over time. So just two gaskets inside the machine, they are what you will replace potentially longer term. Overall, I'm pretty impressed. I think it's clear. I think it's beautiful. I think it makes good tasting coffee. I don't think it's for everybody but if you've ordered one of these because it fit the way you want to make coffee, if it fits your life, I think you'll have a good time. Now, I don't get to keep this. This is going to go to one of my Patreon backers. I'm very grateful that I have a Patreon that gives me a budget to go and buy these things and so I can make independent, honest reviews of them and let you know what I think. But you know, I'm a little bit sad to let go of it. I wouldn't use it all the time, but it would be a fun thing to show other people. It would be a fun way to get people excited about coffee. Seeing the kind of upside down naked, portafilter things, seeing the espresso fill from the bottom is unusual. It's interesting. It's beautiful, again.", "videoID": "ZcZMGx15QBU"}, {"title": "Decolonising Coffee Through Flavour", "text": "Hello and welcome. I'm Raghunath, and my wife Namisha and I co-founded \u0100r\u0101mse. We create content around coffee on Instagram and YouTube, we design coffee-related products, and we also provide a coffee subscription service. So, clearly, we're very coffee obsessed and if you'd like to know a little bit more about us, check the links in the description below. I'd like to start by saying how truly honored and excited we are to have been given this platform to talk about something that we're so passionate about. As the title suggests, we're gonna be talking about how flavour can play a pivotal role in decolonising coffee. The goal here is to create an environment that includes producing countries in shaping the next wave of coffee. We've gone ahead and divided this video into three distinct parts. Part one, localising the SCA flavour wheel. Part two, rethinking traditional brewing methods to be relevant in today's world of specialty coffee. And number three, the importance of preserving original names, and why cultural appropriation needs to be recognised and avoided. We really hope this video helps start an open dialogue and shed light on a topical problem through a different lens. So let's dive right in. So for those of you who aren't familiar with the SCA flavour wheel, this is it. And the 2016 update is arguably the largest and most collaborative piece of research on coffee flavour ever completed. The foundation of this work, the World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon, is a product of dozens of professional sensory panelists, scientists, coffee buyers, and roasting companies, collaborating via SCA and the WCR. For those of you interested in reading more about this, there's a link in the description below. Now, this tool has somehow made its way out of the labs and professional circles and into the homes of coffee enthusiasts world over, including producing countries like India. So, this trend is what sparked the idea of localising the flavour wheel to make it more inclusive. One way in which this can be achieved is by replacing items that are harder to find or more expensive with ones that are local and more easily available. So let's look at some India-specific examples. The amla, or Indian gooseberry, is a very interesting fruit that hits you with a sharp, rip-your-head-off acidity, much like biting a slice of lime. This then gives way to a series of bitters and once your palate has had a chance to recover from the shock, you're left with a rather confounding sweet and lingering aftertaste. The jamun, or Indian blackberry, is another fruit that offers a wild gustatory and olfactory experience. The ripe fruit starts with a round berry-like tartness that is soon accompanied by a syrupy, juicy, grape-like sweetness. But what follows shortly after is what will truly surprise you. An extreme astringency will leave your mouth drier than the Atacama, making you yearn for that next bite, while also enjoying the strange sensation of dragging your bone-dry tongue over the roof of your mouth. Now bear with me. There is a point to these verbose descriptions. These foods, like many others, offer a cornucopia of sensory stimuli that can relate to coffee on various fronts, and if done scientifically, can be used to replace items on the wheel that are hard to find in situ. Similarly, jackfruit, jaggery, or kokum, the Indian mangosteen, are some other alternatives that come to mind. This ease of access will encourage consumers, and even producers, to deepen their understanding of flavour in coffee. For example, a producer who can clearly articulate what a buyer can expect in terms of flavour puts him or her in a much more commanding position. Now the SCA flavour wheel and Sensory Lexicon are scientific tools that are designed to be objective, but the real-world implementation isn't as straightforward, as they were largely developed in US and Europe. This could lead to some implicit biases as to which flavours are desirable and which aren't. One example that stands out is the tasting note 'earthy'. In spite of it being quite sought-after in the sub-continent, seeing it nestled between moldy and phenolic makes one almost embarrassed to admit that they enjoy it. Another particularly fascinating non-coffee example would be asafoetida, or hing in Hindi. This is a highly sought-after spice in different regional cuisines in India, and is meant to add oomph to a dish. However, this same spice, due to its aroma, which most Indians don't find offensive by the way, is nicknamed 'stinking resin', or 'devil's dung' in English. We see this a lot in the food industry, where flavours and spices that are not from the West are often described as pungent, exotic, intense, and harsh, until the cuisine has been appropriated by a largely white audience. So the question we'd like to ask is, can we rethink the position of certain flavours and also include new ones based on location? For example, certain very fermented notes could be delightful to some but repulsive to others, think durian. Now, of course, these localized wheels would be developed through proper scientific research and flavour analysis. We are also happy to report that this presentation is part of a larger project that Namisha is working on with authorized SCA trainer, Erika Koss. It is for her professional-level certification in the SCA sustainability coffee program. So let's talk about the South Indian filter. Now, little is documented about the history of how this nifty little brewer came to be. This actually speaks to the importance of culture being preserved. Coffee drinking, prepared with hot milk and honey or jaggery, became widespread amongst South Indians somewhere in the 19th century, and spread further with the establishment of the India Coffee House in the 20th century. The brewer to prepare coffee in this way transitioned from earthen to brass, and eventually to steel, the latter two being synonymous with the drink, degree kaapi, which is still immensely popular amongst Indians. So to show you how we use this brewer, we've put together a little something special. Cue the B-roll. This brewer is delightfully simple, with its three-part, dual-chamber, single-material design, that is super functional, and will last you several lifetimes. In fact, this brass one here has been handed down four generations, and is probably over 100 years old. This is the top chamber that has tiny holes at the base that act as a filter. The bottom chamber is where the coffee drips into. Lastly, the lid helps maintain a higher brew temperature by keeping the heat in. Both espresso and V60 are percolation brewing methods, where water seeps through a bed of coffee. With espresso, you have very fine grinds, and it's brewed under pressure, so a shot takes around 20 to 30 seconds, typically. Whereas with a V60, you're gonna be brewing a little slower, with a medium grind size, and it takes typically 2.5 to around 4, 4.5 minutes. The grind size required to brew with the South Indian filter can range from espresso-fine all the way down to Turkish. And it's this combo of ultra-fine grinds and slow percolation that give this brewer its unique flavour profile. With brew times that last between 7 and 15 minutes, the gradual heat loss results in a mellow acidity and a sweet, rich, heavy coffee concentrate that can be used much like espresso to make milk-based drinks. While this brewer has been historically used with dark-roasted, chicory-blended commodity coffee to prepare a milky drink with lots of sugar, our experiments have shown that it's more than capable of brewing a delicious cup of specialty coffee, while maintaining its unique flavour profile. So, we'd like to urge you to experiment and push these brewers because you'll be surprised at how well newer techniques like swirls, slow pours using a gooseneck kettle, and WDT  actually work. So to round out this segment, we'll just say that one shouldn't have to seek out a Vietnamese cafe to order a phin, or an Indian coffee house to get a kaapi. What we propose is to not view these brewers as relics relegated to museums, but give them a chance to show off their chops in today's world of coffee. The importance of a name and preservation of it are often overlooked. Today, we'll look at how this affects the F&amp;B industry that coffee is a part of [Food &amp; Beverage]. In order to dive into the subject, we need to first discuss cultural appropriation. Cultural appropriation is the adoption of an element or elements from one culture by members of another culture. Now this becomes controversial when a dominant culture appropriates from disadvantaged minority cultures, and is in fact a form of colonialism. To drive this point home swiftly and efficiently, let's look at one great example: the turmeric latte. How many of you know that this drink originated in India? Called haldi ka doodh in Hindi, pasupu palu in Telugu, and so on in different regional languages. It's an age-old Ayurvedic remedy for general health and immunity. This somehow needed to go through a bastardisation and appropriation process to be adopted into mainstream, and now there is absolutely no traces to its roots. That distinct flavour of turmeric with hot milk and spices like pepper, licorice, and cardamom, when referred to by its original name, helps trigger a direct association to its origin and also ensues a sense of pride and ownership. We make a lot of effort to pronounce croissant, cappuccino, and macchiato correctly, so it would be nice to hear Haldi Doodh instead of turmeric latte. Similarly, it would be great to walk into a Prufrock or an Ozone and order a Filter Kaapi. And for those who enjoy that flavour profile, the name creates a direct link back to the origin country. Ultimately, coffee is a beverage and its flavour is at the heart of what makes it so popular around the world. These are just a few ways that we think coffee-producing countries can be made to feel more included in the world of specialty coffee. By opening people's minds to different flavours, international consumers have a wider variety of choices available to them. Also, local roasters get international exposure. Lastly, and arguably most importantly, as producers feel more connected to the final product, that is roasted coffee, and not just green beans, they get to participate in the dialogue around specialty coffee and its unique offerings. This paves the way for greater economic sustainability, as they are able to undertake endeavors such as roasting on site, roasting at origin, or even producing and branding coffee from farm to cup. So all we ask is you keep an open mind.", "videoID": "DLv2Fzhktb0"}, {"title": "Q&A! Weird Fermentations\uff1f The Decaf Project\uff1f What's My Daily Driver\uff1f", "text": "Today, we're gonna do a little Q and A, because we haven't done one in a while and it's kind of nice to get through a few questions that you have, and you have a lot of questions. First one that you didn't ask but you will: just a temporary glasses change, these are my backups while the other ones are refreshed so that I can see crisply and clearly. Now the questions that I will be answering came from the subreddit. It's linked down below if you're not familiar with it. I left a post there asking for questions and the top 10 most up-voted comments are the questions that I will be answering today. Question number one. \"Not a specific question but I would like to hear your opinion and your explanation on all these new coffee processing methods that have taken the world by storm these days, like anaerobic fermentation and carbonic maceration and so on\". This is a really common question and this is a big question. Now all the answers are gonna be time stamped for the different questions down below, 'cause this one needs a bit of a longer answer, 'cause it's kind of a big topic. And I will say that I will make a much more thorough video on this in the future, when I can actually go and film and touch coffee fermenting and we can talk about it in a much more practical way. So a couple of quick thoughts on this. If you're not familiar with it, you'll have noticed a lot of roasters are offering more experimental processes that have kind of strange names. These coffees taste quite unusual, quite distinct. Now I think the first thing to realize about this whole thing, is that this is roaster-driven, right? Coffee roasting companies are looking to source something unique, something different, and they're the ones driving this experimentation phase, where they want a small lot of something different, unusual, that is all theirs and that's a unique thing for them to sell. It's not really being driven by producers necessarily, initially, and not really by consumers necessarily either. It's sort of happening in the middle, kind of out. Secondly, initially I was sort of anti quite a lot of them. Now there's a mixed group of things going on here. In some cases, there are specific fermentation conditions where you're controlling oxygen and removing it from the fermentation, and that has an impact. In other cases, people are using additives, and it might be specific yeasts, it might be cinnamon in the tank along with the coffee. And it split the industry. Some people were like, \"experimental processing, to a point, yes, but don't adulterate the product with these outside things. Don't put pineapples in or oranges or cinnamon or anything like that in there. No, no, no. That's not pure. That doesn't let you taste the coffee\". And I had my mind changed on this. And my thinking now is that anything that makes a producer's coffee more valuable to them, I think is a good thing. So, if there's a market for people who want that end product and the producer can charge more and make more money, then broadly, I'm behind it, I'm okay with it. The idea of like true taste of place, the idea of terroir, is philosophical and also like a specific set of philosophies, right? You're saying that \"I don't wanna taste intervention\" but when you planted coffee in an entirely new climate and you chose a specific variety to plant, that is an intervention and quite a large one. That's not where coffee is native to. So, from the very beginning, it's an artifice. And so being picky and choosy along the way is fine. You just have to understand that there's no moral high ground here in all of these things. You can say I wanna taste the land, the soil, the variety, and I want the process to give maximum clarity to those things. And I kind of get that, but you're still really looking at a constructed reality of that coffee in a funny sort of way. I have had my mind changed on this. And I've had a lot of insight on this from Lucia Solis. She works in Colombia with producers on fermentations. Her background is wine industry and so she has a very science-minded approach to this stuff. She has a great podcast and Patreon, and I will link them down below, and I strongly recommend if you have any interest in this whatsoever, from a farmer, producer level down to a consumer level, go and check it out. It's really, truly excellent. That would be the one thing you should take away from my answer, is go and listen to Lucia Solis talk about this. Expert. Not the expert. Question two. What has been your favorite Hames Joffmann unhelpful guide so far? If you're not familiar with Hames Joffmann, a YouTube channel appeared that re-cuts my videos into unhelpful guides. Now, initially people were a mixed bag of outraged that someone was stealing my content, they're not. And then just amused cause it's very silly. I fell into this camp. It was actually someone who contacted me through Reddit (Don't do that 'cause I don't really look at the messages there) but they did. And they said, \"I'm making this thing. It's very silly. Are you okay with it?\" And I was like, \"That is very silly. Go ahead.\" And it's just ridiculous re-cuts of my stuff. They're worth checking out if you like a little ridiculousness in your life. I think my favorite one is the recut of the what to do if the coffee is bad in a cafe video. I'll leave a specific link to that, But I'll leave a link to the channel down below as well. They're very silly. I'm entirely okay with them. I have no complaints. I don't think it's stealing. I think that that is a transformative piece of work and I think it's fun. Question three. Has your daily driver setup changed since the Hario switch and Sibarist combo that I posted about back in late 2020? Yes, but not in a way that's very satisfying to you, the audience. Late 2020, in the studio, it was often just me or maybe me and Michael. And so we were making up to 300 or 400 mls of coffee at a time. And that was a great setup for that in the studio. As we're now a team of three most of the time, if we're working together, we're just brewing larger batches of coffee. Not much larger, maybe like half a liter, but that's just not where that combo shines. So in the studio, for just daily drinking coffee, still a lot of V60 actually, honestly, a little carafe. Big fan. Very easy. Nice. That's good. At home, yes, I'm still a steep and release fan. I switch between that and the Clever a little bit. I also drink some other stuff at home too. But I only drink one coffee a day at home, max. Most of my coffee consumption happens at work. Number four. Any updates to the decaf project that you mentioned before? Yeah. Yeah. I've gone backwards and forwards on this about do I just tell you what I wanna do, and thus make a big promise that I have to fulfill even though the logistics behind promising fulfilling this promise is really hard, or do I just keep teasing this thing out on and on and on? The problem is, I gave an answer actually to my Patreon supporters on a live stream I did with them, and that has leaked out into the wider world. So, the decaf project is still in the planning stages because logistically it's kind of a nightmare. And let me tell you what the decaf project is very quickly. I want to understand the impact of the three most common methods of decaffeination. And they would be Swiss Water Process, supercritical carbon dioxide, and then sugar cane process, or ethyl acetate as it's known. I've never had the same coffee decaffed different ways before, right? I've had all sorts of decafs but I've never had the same coffee decaffed that way. So the decaf project is this. I want to take a very large lot of coffee, it would need to be just under 200 sacks of coffee probably, so 13, 14 tons somewhere there, which is a lot, and split it up into four lots. One lot goes for a decaffeination at each of the three different plants. And I would go to the plants and film the decaffeination process, and talk through what happens in a kind of 'how it works' factory type vibe for each of those processes. And then we'd keep one lot un-decaffeinated as your kind of control. Now you wanna taste that and I wanna taste that. So the challenge is, I don't just want Square Mile to be this hub again, after The World's Largest Coffee Tasting, the logistics of that, just were very painful. So what we really want to do is allow, by making it practical and easy, coffee roasters from around the world to buy at least a bag of each process and the control, and then sell it as a set too. And we'll do a big global tasting event, but the ideal would be that you could buy from a roaster in the country that you live in. So if you're in the US, hopefully a bunch of roasters in the US will get on board and take part. If you're in Japan, maybe someone there, Australia, the UK, France, Norway. I'd love it to be a truly global event that isn't about one coffee roasting company. It's just about us all learning and gaining insight into the world of decaf, because I think decaf can be really good. And I'd also love to taste a bunch of different roasters' take on it as well. That would be super interesting as well. So, that's the giant plan. Now obviously, travel has reopened and that's now a thing that's practical, but finding the right lot of coffee to start with is tricky. And then getting logistics lined up so that they're all decaffed as quickly as possible and then moved to logistical hubs in North America, Europe, and probably Australasia, from which roasters can then purchase from, well, there's a bit of leg work there. So, I am having some support and help that I'll talk about once we get going with the project a bit more, but that's the idea. I want to understand these processes and I have to taste that and I have to feel that, you have to taste that too. You wanna know, right? You wanna know what the impact is of these different processes. I don't think one's gonna be better than the others. I think they'll be different and that'll be cool. So that's the plan. That's the decaf project. Question five. What's your favorite bad piece of coffee equipment? Something that objectively isn't very high quality, or isn't particularly useful, or poorly designed, but using it just gives you joy? That's a difficult question. I don't really have a good answer for you on that. Sorry. No, that's actually harsh. I don't think this is badly designed at all. I think this is perfectly designed. It is its own perfection. As for an actual answer to this question, do you know, I don't know. I think that for me, the process and utility of the thing is as important as the coffee that it produces. And so things that make great coffee, but are annoying, don't qualify as useful to me. So I don't have a good answer. It just seemed a good fun excuse to get the Bripe out again. We should Bripe some more soon, right? Question six. How are things going with the vintage espresso machine you got in Italy? Looking forward to seeing more of it. Do you know what, me too? Now the machine has been fully restored. It has been packaged beautifully and has been shipped in a wonderful wooden crate to London where it currently resides. It's ready. I'm not ready. And that's the problem. So as I said, I want it to go into a cafe. There's a few moving pieces behind that. Think about September and it'll be hopefully in a cafe for maybe four to six weeks serving something interesting that I'll talk about more in the future. We'll film the full unboxing and the full installation piece and the whole thing. Enrico's actually gonna come over from Italy and do some training with the team and that stuff. It's gonna be fun. That will appear in a future video. That thing is beautiful. I'm very excited, but more info, probably August, we'll tell you a bit more about what's going on with that particular project, and it going live and all that stuff. Question seven. Difficult question. Given the choice, if I hadn't said I'd answer the top 10 questions, I probably wouldn't have answered this one. What is your standpoint on Comandante suing companies like 1Zpresso and Timemore for selling hand grinders? Now, I've gotta be careful here. I do not have all the information. I am aware that there have been some legal exchanges between Comandante and some other companies, manufacturers, and resellers. I don't have all the information on it. And so it's really hard for me to tell you something meaningful or insightful or 100% true, and wouldn't get me in trouble, which is really important. What I would like more than anything, is for Comandante to come out and clarify the situation more thoroughly. If they are protecting their patents in a way that I think, that is hopefully healthy, then fine. If they're abusing the patent system, that would be very bad and I'd be uncomfortable with that. I feel like any time a company takes legal action against another company in the same space, it's just gonna be really tricky, because there's gotta be a calculation between the financial upside of that and then the reputational downside of that. And it's hard. And I don't really wanna get into it. Comandante, I really would welcome a statement from them at some point, to clarify from their point of view what's going on, but they have been frustratingly quiet on the subject. So I'm not gonna wade in and say anything at this point. So, good question. Sorry I can't give you a good answer. Question eight. How good is Lance Hedrick at giving piggyback rides? It's Hedrick, by the way, not Hendrick. A lot of you misspell his name And as someone who, he gets an extra N, I often don't get my extra N, I have a deep sympathy for the misspelling of surnames. Anyway, would you recommend him as a mean of transport? Yes. Highly. I had a great time, I gotta tell you. If you don't know what's going on here, Lance and I were both in Milan at the World of Coffee show. He said, \"When I see you, I'm giving you a piggyback ride.\" And I was like, \"Sure, okay.\" 'Cause those are great. I remember being a child and it's been a long time since anyone really ran round with me on their back. So, I had a piggyback ride. There's a video. You can watch it right now. Of me having a great time being run around. The only downside of Lance is that if you make him laugh, he stops and drops you. So just very serious piggyback rides only is what I'm saying. Question nine. Any updates on the ultimate coffee travel set up? And if not ultimate yet, what is your coffee travel set up these days? Firstly, I'm barely traveling again. I'm still not really going anywhere. And if I am it's just been the places where I would wanna go out and have coffee in the place that I'm going to. Now, we will go down the rabbit hole of the ultimate coffee travel set up. We will do that, 'cause it's just so highly demanded. At the same time, I haven't seen anything to really truly displace the classic combo of AeroPress and hand grinder for many people, who are solo coffee obsessives. If you're traveling, making coffee for more than one, it's a different thing. It's a different thing. And I don't have a good answer for you yet. So yeah, annoyingly, I broadly will just go and drink coffee wherever I am, even if it's bad, because I just find it interesting. I wanna see, even in remote places where there's one place in town that serves coffee, if it's terrible I still wanna go and see who drinks coffee there, what they do, what the vibe is. I just like cafe culture. So, I wanna go to those too. Even if I'm punished for my curiosity sometimes, often. But hey, as I've said previously, you've gotta drink the bad stuff sometimes. It's really important 'cause it makes the good stuff gooder. That's a word. Question 10. Do you still use the Ember Mug daily? No I do not. Now, that's not to say I don't think the Ember Mug is not ridiculous. It's ridiculous. I'm not saying it's not good. It's great. It's great and ridiculous. And I still struggle with how absurd it is. It's wonderful. I just don't really need it that much. Because again, often with a small team here, we're drinking a little bit, often, right? And we want to drink a bunch of different stuff through the day. We might be experimenting, testing the equipment out, all that kind of stuff. Doesn't lead to large mug of coffee and me sat at a laptop, working, working, working, working, working. It's just too fragmented here, too much going on, for that to be the right thing. I still think it's good though. I still think the Ember Mug is a good mug and I think they have another one coming out soon so I'm curious to see what that is. But I don't know anything about it beyond there's something new coming. That's the Ember Mug. It's still good. It's still very silly. It's still ridiculously expensive. I still need to fully express my immense duality of experience with that thing, of this is a very stupid thing, I like it quite a lot, it's ridiculous, expensive, but it brings me joy. I don't know. That's the Ember Mug. That's the tension in the middle of it that makes it interesting. That's enough. That's enough questions for today. That's the Q and A.", "videoID": "zhX0N1_ye7E"}, {"title": "Bad Coffee In A Cafe - What Should You Do\uff1f", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about how to complain in a coffee shop. We're not, we're not gonna talk about that. We're gonna talk about the scenario that you sometimes find yourself in, where you get served a cup of coffee that you think is bad and you ask yourself the question, should I say something? Now, the fact that this video exists probably freaks out a few cafe owners, a few baristas, don't worry, two things to reassure them: I would say that 95% of the time, I honestly don't say something. And I'll explain why and I'll explain when that 5% is and when it's worth going and having a bit of an awkward conversation. And I'll also say, throughout this whole thing, probably over and over, be a good human, that's really important. So, the way this is gonna work is we're gonna address a couple of different problem cups of coffee, and then go through the various scenarios you might find yourself in, to help you understand what kind of a decision you should make. So, let's start with, you are served a cup of bad tasting coffee. And right from the start, we've gotta get into, well, what is bad to you? Because that's really gonna help you assess the situation that you're in. Because there's three scenarios in which you could be served a disappointing or unpleasant cup of coffee. Scenario one. It's a really good coffee shop but they're having an off day, an off moment, with this one particular drink. Scenario two. You could be in a really good coffee shop who just serve a totally different style of espresso than you enjoy. Or scenario three. The cafe just isn't very good at making coffee. Start to finish. They're not skilled. They're not passionate. It's just not a good cafe. Those are our three scenarios and we've gotta treat each one a little bit differently, so let's go for scenario number one. So, scenario one, the coffee shop is having an off day. Your one espresso, your one filter coffee, has somehow gone a little bit sideways and tastes bad. This is the scenario in which you should say something. Now, what's important here is that you know the coffee shop can make good coffee, because you might be a regular and you've drunk plenty of coffee there, right? You know that you and the cafe, you and the baristas, have a shared idea of what good coffee tastes like. And in this situation, you can go and say something, and I'm not gonna tell you how to live your life, but I would definitely open with, \"Hey, the coffee here is usually really great, I really like the espresso, but this one shot just tastes a little funny.\" And you can tell them a little bit about how it tastes funny but you just say, \"I just wanted to let you know 'cause it's just not quite right today.\" And in that situation, I think it diffuses a lot of tension. The barista knows that you like what they do most of the time, and you've got a shared idea of what good is. I think any cafe that cares about its coffee would want the opportunity to fix their mistake and make you another drink. So, let's talk about scenario number two, which I think is actually a really common scenario out there in the world. And that's the situation where the style of coffee served by a coffee shop, just doesn't line up with the style of coffee that you prefer to drink. I think specialty coffee had a lot of this issue and it leads to one of the most awkward exchanges that you can have, in that you'll go up and you'll say, \"Excuse me, my espresso is just really sour,\" let's say. You like darker roast, they're serving a lighter roast. You think the espresso tastes sour. The barista's gonna hear, under extracted. I messed the shot up. They're gonna make the shot again. And chances are, serve you exactly the same drink. Sometimes, it's difficult to say a coffee is objectively bad. I guess it can be done if you're nerdy enough. But most of the time it's simply really not to your tastes, which is a different thing. Now in this situation, you could maybe give that cafe one more go if you really want to like the coffee from that place. But chances are, that is what they do. That's the style that they serve. And that one drink is just a cost of living, a cost of experimentation, a cost of trying new places. Just jump online, do a little search, find a different place to check out the next time. Speaking of which, that brings me very neatly to a short ad from this video's sponsor, which is Surfshark. Now in the past, connecting to public Wi-Fi, in say a cafe, could be a little bit sketchy, and actually having a VPN was really useful to give yourself real security and privacy while online. And while the internet has changed and security has changed, it still offers you a great way to add that extra layer of security and privacy. Now, Surfshark is a super fast, easy to use VPN service, that allows you to use unlimited devices with a single account. And there's so much more now that you can do with a VPN. In particular, you can unlock geo-restricted content. So, if you're paying for a streaming service, you wanna get the most out of it, well, using VPN will allow you to access content that isn't available where you live, but is available in other places. It really unlocks the full potential of the streaming service. Surfshark have an app for every platform. So, whether your iOS or Android, Mac, PC, or Linux, you are covered.

Thank you to Surfshark for sponsoring this video. So now for scenario three. The coffee shop that's just not very good at making coffee, because this one also actually crops up a lot online. Because if you are a little bit into your espresso, you learn how to make good espresso at home, then you begin to see the way that coffee shops make coffee differently. You begin to see the shots running fast and not in a kind of turbo shot way. You begin to see dirty portafilters, or incorrectly set grinders or bad tamping technique. And you think, with a little help, maybe they could be good. Because for many people this might be the only independent coffee shop in their town, in their area, that's nearby. They want to like it. They wanna spend time there 'cause they like the cafe, but the coffee just sucks. And the question is, how do I broach the subject? How do I say to the baristas, \"Hey, can I give you a few tips and tricks on pulling espresso? Can I help you make me better coffee?\" And the truth of the situation is, you can't. You cannot help that business because the problem that you really need to solve, is so much deeper than just the surface level of, the coffee doesn't taste very good. I wish that somehow there was another way but this is the truth of it. You simply cannot, from the outside, push in good coffee. Even if you knew the owner, I think chances are, that it would be very difficult to fundamentally change the coffee that that coffee shop serves. And that's not the best news, but if you like the space just go and drink something else. Enjoy being in a space that isn't home or isn't work and just hang out, have a tea, a soft drink, a piece of cake, but maybe not coffee. So, in that situation, unless it is truly, truly vile and you want your money back, which will ultimately end your relationship with that coffee shop, then I probably wouldn't say anything and would just drink something else the next time that I was in. This is kind of it, I'll go back to the beginning and say, what you want is good coffee. You have to understand, is it even available where I am? And if it is, then it's worth saying something, and if it's not, then it really, really isn't. Now, there's one more situation that will come up, which is you are actively asked for your feedback while you're having coffee there. And I would say the same rules still apply, in that I wouldn't really say something most of the time. But if it was truly, truly bad, then yes, I might give some very broad kind of feedback and be like, \"I didn't really enjoy the coffee that much. It wasn't really to my tastes.\" I would not get into trying to diagnose why or be like, \"This was under extracted,\" or, \"Your machine needs a bit of cleaning.\" Stay away from that. Because really, it's not gonna improve your day and it's not gonna improve their day. If you're giving them information that they can't meaningfully act on, it's a little bit of a waste of your time and theirs too. And it just leads to a little bit more awkwardness, which is something I would like to avoid. Now, let's talk about the other big issue that coffee shops have, or customers have, and that's temperature. Now, this one I don't think is too complicated. We're gonna split the drinks in half, and we'll have black coffee drinks and milk or dairy alternative drinks. If you have an under temperature black coffee drink, please let them know. Chances are, it's gonna be like a batch brew. It's the bottom of the batch. It's sat around too long. It's just old. You should absolutely send that back. And it's easier to say, \"It's just a bit cold,\" than, \"It's a bit oxidized and gross.\" So, just go with that. Just say, \"This coffee is a little bit cold. Could I get a fresh one, please?\" No one should feel bad about that or stressed about that. Now, dairy drinks are a little bit different because milk, particularly dairy milk, has this of hard stop at 70 degrees Celsius. If you heat it past that point, then you change its texture and you notably change its flavour. It tastes cooked, and it simply doesn't go that well with coffee. For that reason, most coffee shops don't really wanna heat the milk past 65 degrees Celsius. And once that's poured in the cup and delivered to your table, it's still hot to drink and enjoy straight away but it's not really, really hot. And if you are distracted, if you're, let's say, having a conversation with someone, doing a little work, five minutes could pass by and in that case, yes, that coffee will taste disappointingly cool. The problem here is that that's your fault. And if you complain, you're asking them to fix your mistake. Look, there are many, many coffee shops in the world who just want you to leave happy. It's important. It's kind of the function of a coffee shop, is to make you a little bit happier. And so, if you're really nice about it, if you have a relationship with the coffee shop, chances are from time to time, they'll just make you a fresh one and it'll be cool, it'll be okay. But remember, lots of children drop their ice creams, but the ones that throw a tantrum about it are not the ones that necessarily get the free replacement from the ice cream seller. Be a good human. Understand that you're asking for their generosity. It's your mistake that we're trying to fix here. That isn't to say that sometimes drinks don't go out at the right temperature, mistakes do happen. And I think, if it is just straight cold going out or very lukewarm the minute you get it, it's okay to say something and ask for it to be remade if you wanna linger over it and enjoy it, but just don't let it sit around. It's good, fresh, delicious coffee, enjoy it as quickly as you can for the best possible experience. So, that's my advice. And I hope it appears more as like a guide or a framework for having those occasional, slightly awkward conversations.", "videoID": "OXbQx2hfA5k"}, {"title": "Crema Explained", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about crema, that beautiful red-brown foam that sits on top of any well-made espresso. We're gonna talk about what it is, why it exists. Is it good, is it bad? Should you skim it off? Should you leave it on? All of this and more we shall answer in today's video. So let's start with the name, because the name is initially kind of confusing. Crema comes from the Italian for cream, but this is a foam, this isn't cream. Why did it get its name? It goes back to 1948 to 1950. Achille Gaggia has got this new espresso machine. It's brewing at much, much, much higher pressures than anyone has brewed with before and the espresso coming out of his machine has this weird foam on top. And initially people are like, \"What's wrong with the scummy foam on top of your coffee?\" And he turns a negative into a positive. He starts to advertise his machines as having crema cafe naturally naturale. Natural cream coffee or natural coffee cream, I don't know. This is a wonderful stroke of branding genius in my eyes. He names one of the great things about espresso and further cements his reputation or place in history as a father of espresso. So the name sticks. At no point, do we really ever argue it and at some point that Italian word becomes an English word to represent the foam on an espresso. So why does it happen? Why is it unique to espresso, what's going on here? Crema begins in the roasting process. When you roast coffee, you generate CO2. It's a kind of by-product to some of the reactions that go on inside the coffee bean as it goes brown. Things like the Maillard reaction or the Strecker degradation. They produce CO2 as a by-product. That CO2 is trapped inside the coffee bean and if your coffee bean is fresh, there'll still be lots and lots inside it when you come to put it in your grinder to make yourself some coffee. So you grind your espresso nice and fine. You tamp it down, you put it in and you brew it. That hot water comes into your brewing chamber and hits that coffee. Now, one of the properties of water is that the higher the pressure that water is under, the more CO2 that it can dissolve. So that's what's kind of happening here. As the water is passing through those grounds at nine bars of pressure, any CO2 that's in them that is available is getting dissolved into the water. Essentially you're kind of force carbonating your brewing liquid at this point using the CO2 in the ground coffee. The moment, however, that the coffee leaves the basket and it goes from being in a pressurized environment to an atmospheric environment, right, there's no more pressure on the coffee anymore. Well, the water has become super saturated with the CO2 and it can't keep hold of it anymore. It can't keep it dissolved and so it comes out of solution as a bubble. I'll give you a brief visual explanation of this one to hopefully make a bit more sense. We're gonna need two things here. This, not particularly full bottle of espresso. This is old espresso, it's brewed a little while ago. It's got no crema on it whatsoever, but it is espresso and what I'm gonna do, is carbonate it. I'm gonna sort of mimic the espresso brewing process. From that perspective, I'm gonna force carbonation into the liquid and it'll be done so at high pressure, and when we get rid of that pressure, well something interesting should happen. So to force carbonate it, I obviously need a tank of CO2 like this one. So I'm gonna use this, I'm gonna just push some air out of here, 'cause air inhibits carbonation and then... So it might not look like it, but the excess CO2 is dissolved now into the coffee below, just like when you're brewing espresso. And so when I release the pressure... And look, just like on any soft drink that you might expect, a layer of foam has formed. Now with espresso, the carbonation is kind of different. It's not as intense as it would be in a soft drink. You wouldn't get as bigger, coarser bubbles coming out of solution as you would do in espresso. The foam in espresso is much, much, much finer, but the principle is really the same, which begs the question, why does coffee foam? In order to explain this, very quickly we need to talk about why things foam in the first place. Generally speaking, a foam is a bunch of air bubbles trapped in a liquid and something in that liquid is called a surfactant, a surface active agent. It's something that wraps itself around a bubble of air and it makes that bubble strong. Now, the reason it wraps itself around a bubble of air, more often than not, is that part of that thing really hates water, while the rest of it quite likes water. So it's desperate. It's sort of repelled by water. It's desperate to find anything that isn't water. A gas bubble is a wonderful thing, because all the bits that hate water can face the gas, all the bits that like water can face the water. Now, in espresso there are a lot of different compounds that are surfactants. In fact, caffeine at a high enough concentration will act as a surfactant, but it isn't really playing a role here. There's been a lot of research done on this and broadly speaking, they think the active surfactants in espresso are probably things like melanoidins, a protein derived, roasting byproducts. There are other things in coffee that do play a role in foaming, but they may not be the primary drivers of foaming. And so that's how we get crema. We've got our espresso, you dissolve in the melanoidins, some other compounds too, CO2 gets dissolved in as well, leaves the basket, CO2 can't stand solution, appears as a bubble inside the espresso and then gets trapped, wrapped up in all these lovely surfactants and made strong as a foam. But somehow crema retains more of a mystique than say, the head on a pint of beer, but they're basically the same thing. They've happened for the same reasons. But what is it about crema that just gets people so excited? Now firstly, it might be the color. Crema looks stunning. Now the color is tied to a couple of things. It's primarily tied to the color of the liquid down below. Now, espresso looks like it's just one very dark brown color, but it's not. A less extracted or a weaker espresso will produce a less brown foam, stands to reason, but it isn't just concentration, because roast level also plays a role here. The darker you roast coffee, the darker the color of that liquid is gonna be and therefore the darker the foam is gonna be. In addition, the darker that you roast coffee, the more CO2 that you produce and it isn't just roast. Traditionally in Italy, robusta plays role in many espresso blends. Now leaving aside the debate on whether we should call it robusta or Coffea canephora, we'll come back to that another time maybe, the presence of robusta has been kind of desirable to many Italian roasters for a long time, not just because it's cheap and not just because it has low acidity and high body, but because it gives you more crema. In fact, studies suggest that robusta typically has about twice the CO2 content after roasting than Arabica, which is super interesting. But it comes with one more twist. Robusta typically has less oil, less lipids, less fats in it than Arabica. Now you might've made meringue and at some point you might've learned that getting a little bit of egg yolk in your egg white is a no go for foaming, because in that particular foam, the fat in the egg yolk provides an alternative to the air bubble for the proteins in the egg white, which means you have a much, much, much less stable foam, because there are choices in a way. It can go for the fat, it can go for the air. Same is true, kind of in espresso. If you're brewing coffee with Arabica, chances are your emulsion, those little tiny droplets of oil that pressure have emulsified in the liquid below, well those oil droplets are actually working against your crema. The higher the lipid content of the coffee, the less stable the foam is gonna be and that's been backed up by quite a lot of research. Now people will talk about crema as if the emulsified oil in the crema is a really important part of it and what makes it good. Yes, there is emulsified oil in the crema, but only because there's emulsified oil in the espresso liquid and the liquid made the foam, but it's working against the crema's lifespan by being there and as a side note, you might then wonder, if I paper filtered my espresso, if I got rid of the oils in my espresso, would I have longer lasting crema? That's a good question. We ran a little test. We pulled two shots side by side. One of which had been paper filtered using an Aeropress filter at the bottom of the basket. Both of them had nice crema. Both of the cremas lasted as long as you would want them to and certainly longer than the sort of lifespan in which you would typically want to drink an espresso within. So not worth the extra step from that perspective. Now, one more little aspect that came up a few times in the papers, and this goes back to how espresso looks is, is tiger flecking or tiger stripes or whatever you wanna call that flecking that you'll often see on the top of an espresso. This is very common when you brew with a lot of different coffees, they're typically more of a kind of medium to medium dark or dark roasts, very light roasts, you won't get as much flecking on there, because these flecks are little tiny pieces of coffee. They're just tiny particles of ground coffee that have made it through the basket that are stuck in the foam. These look beautiful. They look really good, both in the cup and under a microscope too, actually. They look kind of interesting there as well. There is speculation in the scientific community that these tiny pieces of coffee actually help stabilize the foam. It's kind of an interesting idea. Having read a bunch of papers, I'm not necessarily sure I truly understand why that might be the case and I'm not sure that I've seen that in the real world. Interestingly, they did note that robusta doesn't really produce that much in terms of the kind of tiger striping or flecking on top, which I just thought was an interesting little side note. Now all of this leads us to what I think is the most important question, which is, is crema good, is it desirable? Is it helpful, is it necessary? Before I answer that, I wanna talk about two other quick things. Firstly, this video has an ad in it and therefore it has a coffee giveaway.

If you wanna get deeper into the science, there's one particular paper I would recommend strongly as a starting point and I'll put in a few little supplemental references that you might find interesting too. But let's talk about, is crema good? And from a scientific perspective, it's interesting. It's not as clear cut as you might think. Now, crema is a great piece of feedback. It says you've brewed the espresso pretty well. It doesn't say if the coffee was good or bad, if it was well roasted or badly roasted, but it says you've brewed fresh coffee slow enough to produce a good dense foam, you've done okay. Or you can think of it another way, if you brew a shot that doesn't have good crema, something has definitely gone wrong. But does it really enhance the sensory experience? And here it's interesting, because broadly speaking the answer is kind of, but no. Now, years ago I got myself in trouble with the internet for advocating skimming off the crema for an espresso. It wasn't even my idea. It had come from the coffee collective in Denmark who've been doing it for americanos, I did it with an espresso and was astounded by the difference that it made. Try it for yourself, brew an espresso, get a couple of teaspoons and skim off a layer of crema, stir and drink the shot and you'll find a substantial reduction in the bitterness and kind of roasty quality of that espresso. It might also be lacking and you might argue that it's more effort than it's worth and life is fine. You can just stay and drink your espresso and you can have a nice time. And I won't argue with you there, but this has been backed up by proper research too. There was a paper published by Dr. Britta Folmer and others, I think she talked about it in a Rico talk, that sort of said that varying the amount of crema, essentially varied the presence of the roasted note, I think was their language, the kind of roastiness essentially of the coffee, more crema gave a more intense, kind of a roasty quality to it. Now that paper did also talk about how the sort of perception or very top level, flighty aromatics varied with different levels of crema. Essentially they were more perceptible with more crema, but did also say that broadly speaking, from a sensory perspective, there were not strong differences in the taste profiles of the espresso, based on how much foam they had, outside of this roasted note that really varied across all of them. For me, skimming espresso massively reduces the bitterness. And I think in part, because all of those fine pieces of ground coffee that are trapped in the foam, well they get whipped out and taken away and you don't have to taste them. If you've ever ended up with any amount of grounds in your mouth for whatever reason, you know that they're not a fun time. We enjoy, we taste with more than just our mouth and our noses, how things look has an impact and a great looking crema does enhance the joy, the pleasure of espresso, even if it doesn't do it in that kind of objective way. I'd like to think crema plays a role in the kind of tactile aspect, but I'm not sure in a blindfold if I could tell the difference between one that had lots of crema and one that kind of didn't. The texture of espresso primarily comes from the concentration of the liquid, as well as the particular compounds that you've dissolved, which is kind of down to the coffee that you started with. Now, I did wonder if you could actually cheat and get more crema somehow. So I did try force carbonating coffee beans. Essentially, I put a bunch of coffee beans in a bottle, squeezed out as much air as I could and then aggressively carbonated them. Didn't really seem to make any difference, even if I held it under pressure for a little while. So in case you're curious, I tried it for you, not the biggest result. Such is life. So a quick summary, Arabica produces less crema than robusta, but darker roasts produce more crema than lighter roasts. Fresher coffee will give you more crema. The color of crema is about how dark the roast was to start with and how strong the espresso that you've made it and that's kind of it. Crema is beautiful, but you don't need to chase it. You don't need to worry about it. Eking out a little bit more may not necessarily give you better tasting coffee. I'm interested to hear your thoughts though. What didn't we discuss? What should we have talked about that we didn't? Did you go down a rabbit hole of chasing as much crema as you possibly could and then find that things maybe don't taste as good as they could? Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below, but for now I'll say thank you so much for watching and I hope you have a great day. Lots of you have been asking about the French Press poster. It's now available. We worked with an incredible artist, Ashley Elander Strandquist and she's done a beautiful job.", "videoID": "j5rygXblZJU"}, {"title": "The Best Bean To Cup", "text": "Today, we're gonna be comparing six different bean to cup machines. Machines that kinda make a promise. They say, \"just give us beans, just give us water, we'll take care of the rest. We'll make you delicious coffee.\" We're gonna find if that's true. Now, I have six different models here to compare, as chosen by my Patreon supporters, and they're pretty big, so we're gonna have to go a little bit wider to show you everything that's on the bench today. Now, they're gonna run up in price. So starting at this end is the Melitta Barista TS. That's \u00a31,000. The cheapest thing we're gonna look at today. These get expensive, I'll warn you now. Next up is the De'Longhi Dinamica Plus. That, I think, was about \u00a31,200. Next to that is the Gaggia Accademia. This was \u00a31,250. Next is the Siemens EQ.9. \u00a31,700. A bit of a jump up in price, but again, a jump to the Jura Z10, just under \u00a32,200. Finally, on the end here, this monster is the Miele CM7750, charmingly named, and also \u00a32,500. So, unlike a lot of the comparisons, there's a very big spread on price here, but, you know, there's a big spread generally and you kind of wanna know are they good value for money? Do they make good coffee? And so today we're gonna break it down into three sections really. We're gonna talk through each of the machines when it comes to pulling shots, brewing coffee, how are they to dial in, what's the coffee you get out of them taste like? Then we're gonna talk about milk drinks. These are, I think, very important. All of these machines have an auto milk frothing function. Do they make good texture? Do they get the temperature right? Are they worth owning? And then the third section where we'll talk through the machine's build, the kind of user interface, all of the kind of bits around it. Are they annoying to use? Are they delightful to use? Are they well built? Do they feel cheap and flimsy? And at the end, hopefully, I'll have an opinion on which of these I would recommend. Actually, before we jump too deep into stuff, I do wanna get a couple of things out of the way. Missing from this lineup is the most requested machine, which is the Breville or Sage Oracle Touch. That is not, to me, a conventional bean to cup machine because a human is doing quite a key piece in terms of moving coffee around and actually maybe being involved in puck prep a little bit, or at least having an overview of what's happening there. So it's a different machine. It's a different category. Maybe the best of this can go head-to-head with that in the future, but it sort of didn't belong here. Second, I'm not gonna do an extensive walk through of each of these machines. There just isn't time. I'm not gonna go through menus, or features, or that kinda stuff too much. Really, what we're assessing here is which of these machines can make great coffee, and that's espresso, those are milk drinks, and how is the experience of achieving those drinks? That's what we're looking at. There are loads of videos on YouTube of these machines, full walkthroughs, kind of tear downs, all that sort of stuff is there if you want to go deeper on one particular model, but today we're just gonna focus on making coffee. Onto the testing. Onto the Melitta. So brewing espresso with this was okay. Now I will say up front, the espresso we're gonna get out of this is not traditional espresso. I made a whole video about dialling these things in and talking about how you have to use longer ratios. So, start with the dose on this thing. This thing at maximum dose would get to about 16, just under 16.5 grams of coffee, which is a pretty decent dose. It's the upper end of the machines tested. So generally I was pulling longer shots. It didn't seem to compensate for increased dose. So if you asked it for 60 mL but you had your dose set to maximum, you would typically get about 55 out. So that kind of worked. 16 to 55, surprisingly worked pretty well, nailed some decent extractions. I did do a bunch of testing with staler coffee with this, and this is the first machine that very clearly was doing some aeration to create additional crema. So somewhere in this brew chamber, it's kind of foaming the drink up a little bit. So it looks great, but you know, slightly artificial. There's fresh coffee in now, obviously, but I did want to kind highlight that a few of these machines do do a little bit of aeration to the crema to give you a more pleasing visual experience on your coffee. So with the dose set to max, the drink set to intense, we're just gonna pull, I think, 60 mLs out, which should give us about 55 in the cup. Let's brew. So a pretty thick layer of foam on top. Looks good. We'll get to the robot noises today. That foam looks a little pale, but that's 'cause, again, it is aerated. It's kind of foamed coffee rather than traditional crema. Now, this machine has two bean hoppers, but they both feed into the same grinder. So essentially a different side of the trap door opens to allow different doses in. This is one of three machines that have multiple hoppers, but they all feed the same grinder anyway, which is kind of weird. There will be some mixing inevitably, so if you're kind of putting decaf in one side, know that there may be some ground coffee of fully caffeinated coffee in and around the grinder that may have a tiny bit of cross contamination. The coffee from this has been decent. I would say it's well extracted. We tested out, it was hitting 20% extraction. Not particularly strong, but none of them are gonna be particularly strong for that kind of an extraction in this kind of thing. Grind is one finer than factory. They kind of discourage you from adjusting the grind until you've made at least a hundred coffees, but I would still adjust the grind, but I wouldn't go all the way fine on this one, for sure. So when it comes to espresso, a reasonable quality of brew. I could certainly turn this into another drink and have it taste pretty good, so would say for the espresso sort of purity, bang for buck on this one is actually pretty decent, it being the cheapest machine. So the De'Longhi Dynamic Plus. I, obviously, have made fun of the advertising of this machine and going into it I wasn't really sure what to expect when it came to espresso brewing, but I will say it is a standout in a number of ways. This thing brews differently to most of the other ones, in that it will actually grind quite fine. In fact, it'll grind so fine that everything falls completely to pieces. And if you grind it on the finest settings, your extraction falls through the floor. It's just awful. Channels terribly. Kind of weird that they'll let you grind so fine when the machine clearly cannot handle it. Now, factory temperature setting was really low. I had to crank it to high. Low, it tasted even sub 80 degrees Celsius and the cups were nice but incredibly dull. Hot, much better. Much more interesting. This dose is relatively low compared to the others. The maximum dose I squeezed out of this was about nine grams and the yield therefore was about 34 grams out, 35 grams out, to give close to a four to one that tasted pretty good. This doesn't do any sort of fake crema stuff. If you put stale coffee in this, you'll get ugly, ugly espresso. But of course we have fresh coffee here today. Well, let's make some espresso. Now, obviously, this is a smaller yield than some other machines, so if you're gonna turn this into a milk drink, you might wanna put two of these in the bottom if you're gonna make a big cup or, you know, have a smaller cappuccino in the morning, if that's your thing. How does it taste though? Pretty good. If anything, I would make this shot maybe a little bit bigger. It's got quite a lot of intensity for its size, which is interesting. The extraction is relatively high. It tastes sweet. That has complexity. The acidity is balanced. It is a decent espresso, of a sort. If you're interested in the ground setting used for this, 'cause I know some of you might be, I am at grind setting three. This thing, as you can see, is a single bean hopper for your fresh coffee beans, but anything finer than three things really fell apart with this machine. But at three that kind of turbo shot style, lungo thing, tasted good, extracted really well. Was a little bit impressed again, especially for the money. This is \u00a31,200 and so at the lower end of the price points, but competing when it came to espresso brewing. Making coffee with the Gaggia Accademia initially was very frustrating. I found myself chasing this machine around a little bit more than the others. Really sort of struggling to get a decent extraction, but I got there in the end. Programming on this isn't too painful. You can sort of set one, two, or three for your dose size. Maximum dose I got out of this was about 9.5 grams. This really needed a good 4:1 ratio, so we were about 9.5 to, I think, 45 grams out. Once I added the longer pre-wet in the programming functions, extractions were pretty decent. It's not the best espresso brewer of the group. It was, I think, quite frustrating to use overall, but it got there in the end. Now, one thing to note, I ended up having to go pretty fine on the grinder. The grinder says adjust it when it's running, but it's really hard to sort of grip the knob without taking off the cover of this thing here. But the moment you take it off, this little magnet is gone and it knows the cover's off and it won't operate. So just as a side note, it should really come into UX/UI, but when it comes to grind adjustment, a bit annoying for me. One other thing before we brew some coffee. Often, after the pre-wet it seems to kind of sneeze out a little bit of water from the lines. If it's been rinsed, it looks like clear water, but it just doesn't seem particularly appetizing to me. You know, I kind of wish it wouldn't do that. The other machines don't do that as much. This one seems to do it quite a lot. As you saw there, brews run really pretty fast, which is sort of notable, but that's, I think, the longer pre-wet contributing to that. And certainly, your total contact time is a little bit longer with the longer pre-wet function. The espresso still just tastes a little empty and I know that's because it's a longer ratio. There just hasn't been as much sweetness in the cup as with other brewers out there. Maybe that's an evenness thing. I'm not entirely sure. The coffee is okay and I think if I was drinking it in another drink, I wouldn't be noticing the sort of faults of the cup as much, but as a straight espresso it tends to be just a little bit more sour even at higher extractions, which suggests uneven extraction and just lacking in a little bit of sweetness. It's not unpleasant. It's just not as good as some of the other brews out there. So let's talk espresso with the Siemens EQ.9. This one kind of threw me for a loop the first time, actually. There is a strength selector on the front here and you can kind of scroll down and it will let you go from extra strong into double shot strong plus. Once you get a double shot, it is literally that. It's gonna grind and dose twice in a way. Not in the same dose. It'll kind of pull a shot and then pull another shot on top. So for today, we're just gonna sit at extra strong, which is the maximum dose for a single sort of basketful. In this case that's about 12.8 grams. So it was the maximum dose I kind of measured of the kind of dry weight here. And as a result we're aiming for about 50 mLs out, right? Kind of four to one. The grind on this just really doesn't get very fine at all. At the finest grind setting, I was kind of surprised at just how coarse the coffee still was. In addition, there's no kind of fluffing of the crema here. It's a little bit more what you see is what you get kind of thing. So let's push the button and I'll make an espresso. Now, this is another dual hopper setup and I actually quite like the system for switching between the two. There's just a button on the back on the top of the machine that lights up on the relevant side of which hopper you're drawing down from. This is kind of preferable to the other implementations I've seen of which hopper it kind of pulls from. Anyway, that's not the point. The point is the espresso, and the espresso hasn't been the best. At a 4:1 ratio, a little bit above here, it still feels a little under extracted. Even at the finest grind, that as I said, is still pretty coarse. It's not so fine that we would get channeling. It just feels like it needs to go that little bit finer. With a darker roast I might be okay, but with specialty I really struggled to get much above 18 to 19%. I just wanted a little bit more extraction, really, just to kind of get a bit more texture, a little bit more sweetness, a bit more complexity. I don't mind that it's not as strong as it could be. I just wish it was a bit more interesting as a shot. It's not bad. I just feel like it's leaving some goodness in the puck that you throw away at the end that I wish it didn't. So the Jura Z10 was a machine that I think I had some expectations for going into this. When I started in coffee nearly 20 years ago, Jura were around and I was selling domestic machines and they were kind of the premium brand in the bean to cup space and I think they probably still are for many people. This thing is expensive, but can it brew good coffee? Now, on the surface you don't seem to get much in the way of control. You just get some pictures of coffees that you might want. What's interesting about this machine is that as you start to brew you can adjust things on the fly. You get a window of time in which you can change the strength or how much coffee is being ground and a window of time in which you can change the beverage size. That's kind of interesting. You can leave it like that as a one-off. You can save it as that kind of future program, but interesting. As you first look at the machine, though, there's no way to adjust the grind manually. That's actually hidden away in a digital menu, which is unusual. So there you would need to enter programming, choose the drink, and here you can now see you've got some grind control. That's kind of weird and I don't know how I feel about it, but that's the way that they wanna do these things. It does mean, theoretically, you could program a different grind size for a different drink and that's a lot of flexibility if it works as well as it seems to. Generally speaking though, I don't like to do that. I wanna get one thing dialed in, get one extract, and then do with that whatever I want to later to make whatever drink I wanna to make, but the idea is interesting. Let's get the coffee going. While it is a noisy machine, it does produce the best looking shots out of any of them. It's definitely doing a good amount of aeration of the crema. This is not normal crema. This is kind of like foamed coffee in a way, but it looks great. The pour looks good and something about it looks a little bit more appetizing than the other shots from the other machines. Dose wise, a maximum dose is about 16.5 grams and so we're producing about 55 grams out for a balanced espresso. It's pretty good. It's probably, probably the best of the machines when it comes to pulling a shot. This feels like it just has a little bit more texture, a little bit more fullness. It feels that little bit closer to real espresso than maybe some of the other machines. It's just maybe fractionally better than the best I got from the De'Longhi. It's not a huge improvement by any stretch, but it does feel just a little bit more capable. Now, it might be that the way that it looks as it pours is influencing me, you do eat with your eyes a little bit, but it does make good coffee. It's doing a pretty good job extracting the coffee. There's enough control over all the necessary bits that it's kind of easy to dial in, and tweak, and adjust, so of these machines when it comes to espresso brewing, this is, you know, in the top spot or definitely in the top two spots alongside the De'Longhi. Before we talk about brewing with the Miele CM7750, I should explain how this particular unit ended up on the bench. To choose these machines I put a call out to my Patreon supporters. they could pick a manufacturer and a machine. And what we did is per manufacturer, I picked the most requested machine. And when I went to the website I saw it was expensive, but I couldn't really see the size of it. It's monstrous. It's huge. I mean, it's two and a half thousand pounds, so you feel like, I don't know, more is good, but it's a lot. It's just very big. And on the website it didn't look that big, but it's really big. Brewing espresso with it has been frustrating, if I'm truly honest. This, again, is a machine that feels like it's not really built to work with light roast specialty coffees. The grind adjustment is hidden in the side here. On the side panel is a little switch. It's okay at it's finest setting. Some of the machines aren't. This one is fine. It's still actually pretty coarse. You get three hoppers on top of here, which again is super weird. Just one grind there for your money, but three hoppers. And it'll sort of open a trap door to feed the grinder from whichever one. Again, contamination is kind of a concern if you're really worried about decaf or caffeinated coffees intermingling. The actual brew process is annoying to dial in. The kind of process is hidden behind several menus. It's one of those ones where if you wanna change the portion size, the beverage mass, you have to kind of press go and then hit stop at the appropriate sort of time. It hasn't always replicated that amount particularly accurately for me. And so overall a bit frustrating, but also kind of absurd. Let's make some coffee and you'll see what I mean. It's very noisy. Why did that move?  Why add a motor to a part that on every other machine you just move up and down with your hand, and that works fine? Why put a point of failure there? I don't know. The coffee looks good. It's another machine aerating the crema a little bit to kind of give that artificial foaminess. The shots look quite nice. Taste wise, under extracted and for a couple of reasons. This did not achieve the programming that I just wanted. It shorted me, I think, eight or nine grams on what was requested, but more than that, the grind is just to too course. I've added an additional pre-brewing stage to this to try and increase the extraction and that hasn't worked. I think this is a machine that genuinely just struggles with the very light, very dense coffees that specialty people may wish to enjoy. Specialty people? Specialty coffee lovers. Maybe that's better? Weird coffee people like me. I would say it's probably the weakest of the group when it comes to brewing specialty coffee and just the most frustrating to dial in with, make changes to. Yeah, I think unfortunately, despite being the most expensive, what you're getting for your money is not more advanced brewing technologies. We're gonna go into the milk testing next. I'm gonna make a cappuccino with each of the machines. It just seems a good benchmark for foam quality for that kind of stuff there. I'm gonna be using a milk alternative, 'cause that's what I would choose to drink. Just so you know going in. On we go to testing. So the milk steaming set up on this one is the box of milk on the side, the tube that then runs into the brew unit or also the front end of the brew unit. Let's see what the results are like. Now, texturally, this is not looking superb. It's gonna benefit, I think, from a little bit of a stir and as you kind pull it back some of the foam here is actually okay. There's just a few big bubbles from right at the end, but I suspect most of the texture's kind of adequate. That sounds harsh, but you know what I mean. In fairness pretty, pretty good. Like the coffee taste is decent, as we discussed before. And, obviously, we've heated milk not too hot. That's good. So the temperature I would say is good for me, might be a touch cold for some people, but I think that's a nice temperature. Texture is decent, but not outstanding. Overall, it's really not a bad drink. I'm not upset by the quality of milk foam. I feel it could be better and if you gave me a traditional machine I think I could make it notably better, but for automation, I would call it kind of reasonable. So let's talk about milk with this thing. Now, the attachment for the milk, the little sort of cool box, goes in the front here. It slots in actually to the place that the hot water spout sits into. This thing does the kind of milk first coffee second. So we'll have it in a nice glass for that traditional sort of latte macchiato style look, because why not? Let's go. There's a little dial at the top to control your foam level. I'm set to the middle. Let's make a cappuccino. Okay, we've got drink. It needs a mix. Kind of a interesting layering effect going on here, but let's give it a stir. I'm gonna call the foam quality on this disappointing. Big bubbles, not a particularly tight fine moussey micro foam. Not horrific, but 4 out of 10. Temperature wise, it feels a little hotter. A sort of upper end of where you'd want things, but not too bad. Obviously, we're having a relatively small espresso to start with. For a single shot this would be kind of the max drink size you might have. That might be just right for you. But flavor wise, decent. Obviously, the extraction was pretty good. As long as the milk is not overheated or anything weird has happened, it should taste pretty good. So flavor, good. Texture, I feel like I just want a less dry foam, a tighter knit foam, a moussier foam. This is not delivering on that front. So milk with the Gaggia Accademia. There's this large carafe that clicks onto the front and this little piece here actually has two positions, which is notable. One is to the side where milk will come out into your cup. The other I really like. When you bring it back to the sort of handle position, that's a rinse position that will rinse the unit into the drain box. Just neater, nicer for me, overall. Let's see what the texture's like though. Texture of the foam, kind of okay. I have this set to, I think, a normal amount of foam, not like extra foam, 'cause I don't want too much foam. I would say probably comparable to the De'Longhi's foam quality. Not horrific. You just can do a lot better in the world of milk foaming. I don't really like the angry purge of steam right at the end on top of the cup. That seems to be a very strange  design decision or a workflow decision. Overall, it's not a bad drink. There's a good extract of coffee. The milk is not too hot. The texture is just where it falls down a little bit. The EQ.9 is interesting and stands out because it has an integrated milk tank here. Like it's built right into the side of the machine and I don't know how I feel about that. It's kind of weird that you would have a hot machine and wanna build a cold thing into it. I would imagine it's pretty well insulated, but I suppose from a workflow perspective, from a look perspective, it's nice to have it integrated and not have a tank and an awkward little hose running between the two. As for the drinks that it makes, well, let's find out. Having given that a mix I have to say the quality of the foam is actually quite good. It's a little bit dry, but not too bad. The bubbles are pretty tight. It looks pretty moussey. There's a nice quantity of foam for me on the drink. So really, really not bad. You can tell the coffee lacks a little bit of something in there. There's a little bit of acidity creeping through from that brew that isn't quite what I want it to be, but actually the milk is pretty good. I would imagine with, again, a more developed roast this kind of a drink would work really well. I would say it's decent. I would say that's good milk foam. It's not outstanding. You could do better with a traditional machine, but it's actually very good. So as you look at this machine right now and this setup, you'll notice something a little bit unusual. The Jura has the little tube that feeds the head here where it'll do the foaming and heating but no container. You can buy an additional container, but for \u00a32,200 you don't get it for free, which is kind of wild, but also kind of in line with how a lot of premium brands operate. They might argue that to include it with it would make it \u00a32,300 or something like that and people didn't wanna spend the extra. I don't know. I find it kind of weird. Granted, you can just stick it into a container of milk or milk alternative and away you go. There's nothing else to wash up apart from the tube itself. So maybe that's good. I don't know. I find it kind of a weird decision from a brand perspective, from an experience perspective, but what's the actual drink like? Now, this cappuccino looks like a very foamy affair. The see what we actually get. That seems like a pretty accurate representation of what it promised. Now, that's a good amount of foam and the foam for this quantity, which is a thing, obviously, the more foam we have, the higher the chance that it's dried out a little bit, it's not bad. It's not outstanding. It's sort a 6.5, 7 out of 10. As for the taste though, pretty good. It tastes as you'd expect. The milk's a good temperature, actually. The texture of the milk is pretty good for drinking. Touch dry, as I said, but overall really not bad. And I would think drinks more like a flat white or something else would work even better like this. Yeah, it's a good extract of coffee mixed with, you know, a nice temperature and texture of milk. Pretty good. Really pretty good. You know, there are certainly cafes serving worse than this but there are cafes serving significantly better as well. And we, once again, return to the Miele. The milk system, again, is a sort of separate container here. It's just a glass container, which is nice. Feels premium. Not particularly good for sort of thermal retention or keeping the milk cold. And that feeds into the bizarre uppy-downy head here. Let's make a drink. If you're watching this with headphones, I'm really sorry. This machine just appears to be an auditory assault. It still just won't be quiet now and this sort of fan or whatever seems to run for a while. I'll try and talk over the top of it. The process of dialling in milk drinks is not great. It's another one where you have to sort of put your container underneath, fill it to the point that you want, and sort of hit stop and save. Not super accurate in its recreation or replay of that particular recipe either. The milk foam, though, is quite nice. Like that's a nice level of foam for a cappuccino. The foam is nice and, you know, tightly foamed. It's not flawless. It's another 6.5 out of 10, but really not bad. Temperature's pretty good. The drink is let down by the taste of the espresso being a little bit weak and under extracted. Attaching this the first time is annoying because right now this thing is up high and so you have to sort of start brewing get it to drop down enough that you can connect the little tube. Just kind of bizarre to see the up down thing with the tube on the side. I don't get it. I don't get it at all. I'm gonna stop talking about this now because the sound is just winding me up, but overall, the drinks are okay. I'm maybe, you know, struggling with this thing a little bit. So the Melitta here, it did pretty good coffee. It did decent milk foam. How is the rest of the user experience on this machine? And if I'm honest, quite poor. I would say first and foremost these buttons are just bad, particularly if you don't use the sliders. If you use the little slider thing here at the bottom, that's kind of a nice touch. That's good. But if you actually wanna use say the plus minus buttons, they are miserably unresponsive and irritating. The build quality overall is kind of fine. You know, they've hidden away the grind adjustment inside the side panel here so it's not obvious to you. There's a lid that is frankly bad on top of these things here. I just think it looks really weird the way that it sits up like this. I don't understand why it isn't flush. I know it's easier to pick up, but they've also put a little groove here to get your finger into to lift something up, so why make this giant thing that's just bad? I think dual hoppers aren't easy to recommend. I would say that. Like it works okay as a dual hopper, but I'm not a huge fan of it. Just overall, I found this a frustrating machine to work with but it's by far the cheapest. And actually if I was buying one of these just thinking purely about espresso, it would be a contender because for its price point it kind of bang for buck is pretty good. I think sometimes about, you know, what it would be like to try and fight the user interface before I've had coffee and I would imagine a great deal of rage. It is, for me, actually a deal breaker. UX/UI really, really matters to me and even though I think it makes good coffee, especially for the money, the buttons here alone are just too frustrating. You may not have these same rage issues, though. If you own one of these, I'd really be interested to hear your comments down below about how your experience has been with the buttons. Let's start with the build on this and it does feel a little cheap and plasticy, but it is at the lower end of the price points we're discussing in today's video. The footprint overall is a big win for me. Like the use of space is very clever. I like it being a small machine. That's good. As for the sort of front end user interface. The screen is nice. The user interface okay. The accuracy of the touch points is a little bit low for me. You know, I've mis-pressed espresso quite a few times and sort of started a cappuccino, though thankfully, it's relatively easy to abort the process. The programming is a little frustrating. I wish you just had an option to add five more milliliters to your espresso versus what it is, but to program your sort of desired espresso size it requires running the machine, measuring as you brew, and stopping it at your desired setting. So every time you wanna increase the size of your shot, you'd have to kind of break out the scales, go through that process. It's a little bit convoluted to me. Whereas other machines will just let you add five mLs to the next brew. That's much easier. That, to me, is far more preferable. I suppose there's more granularity in this but I don't always want granularity. I just want to get to a better coffee as quickly as I can. Overall, okay. Not spectacular, but really not bad to work with. The EQ.9's build and its UI. Well, firstly, there's a big jump in price. We're at \u00a31,700 here. That's only \u00a3500 more than the previous machine and you would expect an improved fit and finish and I think you get that. Generally, I would say this is a good looking machine, of a particular style, sure, but the lines are good, materials feel good. It feels well built. Not a huge footprint, but not particularly small. The front here, I actually quite like. I quite like the combination of these buttons with the display here. I think it keeps it simple enough in that day to day you're not interacting with anything particularly complicated, but you can quickly and easily make small adjustments. I think as a UI/UX experience, pretty decent. The grinder, the lack of ability to go particularly fine does seem like a flaw in this. And the grind controls in the back of these things here feel cheap and flimsy. Do you know what I mean? It doesn't feel like a robust piece of this unit. But everything else, I think, is pretty well done. You kind of feel like you understand what you're getting for your money in terms of build compared to the cheaper models there. So the build of the Z10 feels, looks pretty premium in this particular world. Certainly within these group of machines this felt the most premium or luxurious. It's little details like the bean hopper is heavy, it's weighty. It's kind of a weird design and I don't love the bean hopper being the size that it is. It's really big, but it does feel nice. The material feel nice. The click wheel feels nice. The touchscreen is responsive. They've made sure that the drinks are far enough apart on the display that you won't accidentally press the wrong thing and it's a very simple user interface. Below the hood it's easy to access things like drink settings, or if you push and hold this button you can get into a lot more kind of programming settings around cleaning, around other programming in the machine. And there's a host of features under there, but they're mostly kept at arms length, kept out of your field of view because it just wants you to think about making coffee. Overall, I get why they have the reputation that they do. It feels very well built. It feels very well made. It feels that little bit premium. The fact that you've got, you know, the blue LEDs over here for the crisp, cool water, and then the warm LEDs here when you're pulling shots of espresso. It's a little obvious, but it's also just a nice touch. I find hiding the grind adjustment away a strange thing. It requires I trust the machine quite a lot, but it seems to produce good tasting espresso, so I can't really argue with that. Now we return once again to the Miele to discuss fit and finish. I'll be honest, I do not understand the price of this machine. For two and a half thousand pounds, the fit and the finish is not great. Like it's quite a cheap feeling plastic. It's a gloss plastic on this side. It's a kind of brushed effect here. Doesn't really work super well for me, but you may feel differently. Three hoppers and one grinder doesn't feel like the feature set you might want it to be. I don't know when you'd want three different sets of coffees slowly, you know, staling inside a little hopper on top of a warm machine. At least you have a big cup warmer on top, which I guess, you know, it maybe feels like a machine for an office, right? Like that's the sell here, which is you should be able to make lots of coffees for lots of people rather than just at home. But if I was in an office, the noise alone would mean it would need to be a long way away from where people work. Let's talk about the UI, because it and I did not get on. The screen is not particularly beautiful. The information offered is pretty poor. Finding things within the menu is not particularly intuitive. I didn't really like the touch screen. I didn't like the button layouts. I just sort of struggled with it. And that's just me. You may not have as much of an issue as I do. One other note in testing, this machine loves to rinse. It really does. All of the machines will run periodic rinses. I just feel like this wanted to rinse more than the others and the more a machine rinses, the more it draws down its water tank, the more it wants you to refill it, empty it out the drain box. They just nag you a little bit more. The upside, obviously, is that you have a cleaner machine on the inside, but I feel like this one is just on the side of a bit too much rinsing. And if it makes my notes in testing, then it really stands out. And that was just one thing I wanted to highlight. And so I confess that through the lens of price and experience I've really struggled with this one, probably more than the others. I feel like maybe it just didn't belong in this lineup and it's built for a different environment than the home. And so I'm cautious of being unfair, but I still struggle to really see why it's so expensive for the feature set and sort of experience that you get. Let's get straight to the answer to the question if I was given unlimited budget, which of these would I buy? And the answer probably is the Jura. It's a lot of money though. \u00a32,200 would buy you a very nice grinder and a very good espresso machine. You'd have to do a bit more work, but you would get better results. But within the category, I think it did really well. The espresso was very good. The fit, the finish, the build is good. The footprint is reasonable. It's a good machine. Not the best milk and interesting that, you know, the best coffee and the best milk did not necessarily line up. But overall, UI was good. Lots of positive things to say about it and you can see why it's at the top end. The glaring omission of a milk container is kind of weird, but I guess I'll let that one go. However, I do want to talk a little bit about the cheaper end of things. Actually, these two here showed pretty well, particularly the De'Longhi. Now, obviously, I've teased the De'Longhi's advertising, but I thought it performed really pretty well. For the money, it was up there in terms of shot quality. The milk was fine, you know, again, unspectacular but kind of decent. The footprint is small. It's well put together. Good UI. Yeah, I think it's good. Is the Jura twice as good as the De'Longhi? I'm not sure. I think this is probably the best value machine in this group that we've tested here today. And I actually think the Melitta was okay. The UI was kind of a deal breaker for me. If that was fixed, then that would be much more interesting, but it was a good little performer. The others, you know, in some cases quite frustrating, in other cases okay, just outperformed. But an interesting test, I think, nonetheless. Now, as I always say in these reviews, I don't get to keep these machines. My Patreon helps buy these things and as a result I give them away at the end of this to some of my Patreon supporters. It makes me very happy to give these things away, especially 'cause I certainly don't have room for them here in the studio.", "videoID": "iZEM1cC86t8"}, {"title": "Dalgona Coffee - Explained and Upgraded", "text": "Today we're going to talk about this thing. It's what most people called Dalgona Coffee. It's the internet sensation sweeping the world and I love it when coffee is a thing that is everywhere 'cause it means we get to talk about it. We get to get a little bit nerdy about it And so what is this thing? What is this craze? Well, it's a milk drink topped with this thick, glistening, glorious, unctuous, creamy, rich beautiful foam heaped on top Is it any good? I don't know. We'll drink it and we'll find out. Now, its name is a little bit confusing because it kind of comes from Korea but it doesn't. This kind of frothy coffee thing is common in lots of parts of the world But this drink got its name in Macau, confusingly. There was an actor, Jung Il Woo, who was there and he said it tasted like Dalgona which is a Korean  street snack. It's a little bit like honeycomb - you melt sugar and you add baking soda and you chill it down and you get this kind of foamed, hardened sugar. It's delicious who doesn't love that. And he said it had that kind of honeycomb taste. It's honeycomb coffee, basically. But the Internet, the world immediately anglicized and everything and so it became Dalgona coffee even though that's not how you say that word but Well, I should drink one, but not this one. We should make one from scratch. Start at the beginning and then taste that. So let's talk about how to make it in the traditional way. Well, I think a big part of its appeal has been the simplicity of it as a recipe. You need kind of three things to get going maybe two more things later, but basically, the fun bit, three things. You need your instant coffee. puncture that seal for freshness  Now this whole thing is done volumetrically as a recipe, so what this here to do is use two units instant coffee. So let's say two spoonfuls. Let's get a reasonable level. Here. Now I hate volumetric recipes, so I'm going to measure this just kind of get the ratio about right. So that's six grams of coffee. We add to that the same volume of sugar, which turned out to weigh considerably more. So that's 21 grams of sugar. About the same volume of water, and that's it. And that's about 20 grams of water. Now, you whisk it for a miserably, miserably long time. I'm going to be using this little guy which I quite like. He's actually addressing whisk but I think for this purpose he's gonna work pretty well. I guess time for a time lapse. So after your three miserable minutes of whipping, maybe four, you end up with a very soft, gooey, moussey, meringue-like foam. And this is I guess the interesting bit the beautiful bit the bit that captures everyone's attention - that texture. Let's talk about why that happens. Now, I've seen a few different explanations of this most of which I've kind of disagreed with a little bit. Including one from Howard McGee which made me feel weird inside because he taught me so much. Anyway, here's my explanation. The first time I saw it I thought that looks a lot like a meringue before you cook it, obviously. And it kind of is the same thing. Now, a meringue you've got a couple of things going on. You've got egg whites. They're providing the sort of the foaming properties of that thing and you've got sugar to stabilize the foam and here coffee is providing the foaming agent. Now when you roast coffee, you create a bunch of compounds called melanoidins. These were identified by a paper published, I think, by Illy or the researchers at Illy, that these were the foaming agents in espresso. They allow crema to happen, they form a stable foam. These I suspect are the very same foaming agents here that they're typically called surfactants which is a shortening of surface active agents. They are things that wrap themselves around bubbles and make those bubbles strong in milk for your cappuccino. Well, proteins there are playing the role of these surfactants. So here in coffee just having surfactants doesn't make a perfectly, stable foam. You'll know that because your crema on your espresso disappears within a minute or two. It kind of bubbles away and fades. What's happening here is a couple of things. We're whisking it to form a foam, but the liquid that we're making a foam out of is extremely viscous. We've got, you know, 20 grams of sugar in 20 grams of water that's a 1:1 syrup here. And we've also added six grams of soluble material. That's thick and gooey liquid now, right? That's sticky, so when you form the foam out of such a viscous liquid, it means that your drainage is very slow. And the smaller your bubbles can be, the stronger that foam is going to be. A small bubble is inherently stronger, than a much, much larger bubble. That's what we've got here. We've whipped air into a sweet coffee like liquid. And we've beaten it until the bubbles are tiny, but that foam is very, very stable And so to finish the drink traditionally you need a couple more things. You need some ice. You need your milk or milk alternative. And then all you need to do to finish this is spoon on your foamy, gooey coffee thing and of course It will float because it's a foam it's mostly air. You'll see it obviously increased in volume - a great deal - and this kind of is with all the gooey, drippy bits  what people call Dalgona coffee? You've probably got some questions. Is it good? Let's find out. No, not really. This is a preparation method. What you get out of it is as good as what you put into it. This isn't a transformation. We're not creating flavor. This tastes like sweet instant coffee and milk. And whether I whipped into a gooey, glossy, wonderful foam or not. It's still It's still sweet instant coffee and milk. It's not horrific because it's sweet and there's some dairy to mitigate that bitterness But it's not delicious. Now your next question will be \"Okay, okay, maybe can I make this out of espresso?\" And the answer is probably not. The problem with espresso, confusingly, it's that it's too dilute. Making it this way, when we've got six grams of instant coffee to 20 grams of water, well, we have a much, much, much, much, much stronger liquid than we could ever hope to produce from espresso without making that espresso taste disgusting. If you try to just sweeten espresso and whip it, you will get a foam out of it eventually, but not a stable foam because it's too dilute. It's not viscous enough. It will drain out of that foam far too quickly. You could try and concentrate your espresso, I guess. Two ways spring to mind, you - or three, I guess, probably just two. You could heat it - essentially you could reduce it on the pan. Don't do that, though, that will taste disgusting. and also when you heat coffee like that you create some unpleasant compounds. Just - I don't advise doing it. The other thing I could think of would be doing something like pulling a shot and putting it into so like a chamber vacuum. Where if you put a vacuum on it, it would boil as a liquid at room temperatures. So you wouldn't be adding heat, but you could still evaporate out a lot of water. You'd lose a lot of aromatics, but I guess it would work? You'd want to remove probably half the water. I don't have a chamber vacuum but I guess, if I did, I could test it that way. And so the next question is, well, do I have to whisk it 400 times with a whisk? I don't think so. There are a number of different ways to achieve this kind of foam, and I looked at a few of those. So the first and most obvious one would be something like a paddle mixer that you would use to make meringue - very good. On the internet, you've seen a lot of people using like a hand whisk that works very well. You could probably use something like a stick blender. And I also suspect you could probably get something like a milkshake machine to work if you were trying to make large volume of this stuff. The principles are very similar throughout everything - which leaves you with one question left, What about, what about, good instant coffee Now before we do that - that's what we're gonna round this video out with - I'm gonna get some good instant coffee out in a second, I do just want to have a little bit of a PSA with this one, a little bit of a warning, this is a single beverage and in making this I pretty much used all of the coffee foam that I created and that coffee firm had six grams of instant coffee in it. That is about three and a half standard two hundred mili cups. That is it is a lot of coffee plus 20 grams of sugar right? So, so this looks cool, but bear in mind, it's very strong. Just go easy on it. That's all I'm gonna say now I get sent coffee sometimes, and a little while ago some lovely people at the Belleville brewery in Paris, they sent me some of their instant coffee and I used it now and then when I've needed instant coffee. And it seems sensible to use it again now. Now from the last recipe, we worked out the kind of mass ratio. It's about one to three to three. So that way I can just weigh how much is in one of these and I can use the right amount of sugar and water, and not fuss about with volumetric things that are nonsense 'cause mass all the way. So I'm gonna add about 10 grams of sugar and about 10 grams of water. And now I'll whisk it again. This was very interesting. Initially, I could not get the nice coffee to foam. And I think part of that is to do with the way that small companies are making instant coffee being very different to the way that much bigger companies make instant coffee and I think essentially I had over diluted it. And so I needed to use more sugar. So as a slightly complicated workaround, I added more sugar, but it wouldn't go into solution so then I made a quick workaround, heat it up, got the sugar into solution, but it still wouldn't firm. So then I put it in the freezer to chill it back down again because it's all about viscosity right. And, and the cooler a surface is, the more thick and viscous it gets. So - that worked. So if you're having trouble if you've started with hot water and you're having trouble getting a good foam going, cool it down. Chill it down. That's very important it's a great quick way to get where you need to go. The cooler the syrup is, the better that coffee syrup will foam. So let's let's get on with it. Let's make a let's make a good specialty Delgona. Do bear in mind that this is one full sachet. so, it's a - it's a full cup of coffee here, even though it's not that much of a lovely, foamy, friend to sit on top. So here it is a specialty coffee version. Is it better? Is it good? All right, then get down with that. That is like a little little coffee ice cream going on here. Cold dairy, sweet coffee. None of the harsh bitter burnt, Robusta-ey, generally unpleasant qualities that most instant coffee has. This is pretty okay. I could get down with this. I mean, it's very sweet, wow. These have a lot of sugar in this, a lot of sugar. Let's give it a stir. Now it looks gross. I mean I just tasted sugar. That is incredibly sweet. A little bit of coffee there. There's a little bit of coffee there, not a lot of coffee actually, a lot of sugar. Mmm-hmm. If you got some instant specialty coffee lying around you haven't you used it, or haven't found a use for it? You stuck at home, you want to do something interesting? Yeah, make this actually that was that's not bad. That's not bad. I'm okay with that. But remember the rules of the game. You're just trying to whip air create a really dense foam in a coffee syrup. That's that's all you're doing. You're whipping a coffee syrup and the end result is a coffee syrup.", "videoID": "WHmpgMsW-aA"}, {"title": "Product Review\uff1a Oracle Touch by Sage\u29f8Breville", "text": "So this is a review of the Oracle Touch espresso machine. Now it's made by a company called Sage in the UK, or better known as Breville in the rest of the world. Now, I'll start with the truth, which is, for a decade, I haven't had an espresso machine at home. And to be honest, I haven't really wanted one. When people ask me, \"What espresso machine should I get \"for my house?\", well, I ask them a question back. \"Do you really want a new hobby?\" Because that's what espresso at home is. For most people, it's an investment in equipment, but it's also an investment in time. When I got started working in coffee, I started selling little domestic espresso machines and I know all too well that the romantic idea of getting up at the weekend, reading the paper, making a little cappuccino, that's very appealing to people, but it's not true. You skip the bit where you turn on the machine, you wait for it to get hot, then you dial in two or three shots to see how things are tasting, then you pull a couple of shots, and then you spend some time cleaning up. And for me, well the idea of paying two pounds for someone else to do that, to make me an espresso, that seemed like a good deal. Now at home, I typically just brewed filtered coffee, so taking this home for a little while, well that was the first time in literally ten years I've made espresso at home and it was interesting. This is a 2,000 pound espresso machine and that's quite a lot of money these days and a lot of money to invest in an espresso machine. Especially in one that's labeled as a bean to cup. For people who didn't want to hobby, that was kinda your choice, right? If you didn't wanna do all the hard work, then you just push a button and the machine did its best and you got coffee. And they all had a problem that made them quite finicky, quite difficult to extract well with and prone to breaking down. There were trying to work out how to get coffee from a grinder into a brewing chamber and then to get rid of it. And that moving of ground coffee both wet and dry is pretty difficult to do and Sage's solution is pretty simple. You just get the human to do it. So this machine comes with a portafilter and a grinder and it's all built in as one and you're going to be the one that moves ground coffee around, that's going to be your contribution to the brewing process. So, the way this thing works is kind of interesting because it's kind of against the typical obsessive, geeky, wanna control every factor and they know espresso making is hard and so what they've done is take away some of the variables. What this means is that the way the grinder works is that when you lock it in, click it into place and you click across to the right hand side, it'll start grinding. It'll grind, dose, tamp, the whole deal, all in one go, leaving you a prepped portafilter ready to brew. So you lock that in and you hit go. Now, it's a touchscreen, and this means you've got lots of choices and what it lets you do is choose the different kinda drinks you wanna make, choose the grind setting and choose the brew time for each one, and that's another key part. This doesn't let you control the amount of liquid going through, like a volumetric might or with weighing scales or something like that. It's gonna brew at a fixed pressure for a fixed amount of time. Now this is no bad thing. By and large, what you might wanna do is use your consistent dose setting and therefore use a consistent brew time and then simply adjust the grind setting, finer or coarser to get the desired amount of liquid that you want in the kind of ideal brew time. So I'll just set the brew time to 28 seconds, I'll just use my grind setting to control my espresso brew ratio. Speaking about brew ratios. This things, the set up it has, it doses quite a lot of coffee into the portafilter, it's kinda dependent on the basket that you're using. Typically I brew coffees that taste good at a one-to-two, to about one-to-two point two as a ratio, so if I put 20 grams in, I'm getting between 40 and 44 grams of liquid out in my desired brew time. Here, I probably say with those kind of coffees, you probably want to push them to one to two point five, so if you have 20 grams of ground coffee, you probably want about 50 grams of liquid out. So to be honest, with certain lighter roasts, shorter, tighter shots of espresso, closer to a ristretto, even like a traditional, normal espresso, they're a little bit harder to do. If you enjoy that kinda thing and you're very texture driven, then lighter roast may not be the answer for you and you may wanna brew with a slightly deeper, more developed roast that's gonna give itself up a little bit more easily. Sage made waves with their first espresso machine, had the really good temperature control, all of that stuff is still here, so they've done the kind of hard work on consistency and control, while trying not to overload you with too many variables. So it brews pretty good tasting espresso. I got some very tasty shots out of it. It was pretty easy to use. It required reconfiguring how my brain works a little bit with the fixed dose and fixed time and just manipulating with grind, but I didn't mind that too much at all. One thing that this machine does incredibly well and Sage has done for a little while now, is steam milk beautifully. Now this, the automatic steaming of milk, is not new on commercial equipment for sure. You know, there's been big commercial espresso machines that have been able to automatically texture milk to a really beautiful foam. Certainly you can pour a great latte out with it, that's been around for a while, but these guys have been doing it more and more on domestic machines and the quality is frustratingly good. When you can do something that good at home, you really have to question why this kind of technology just isn't everywhere all the time. And I get that the lack of craft may upset some people, but there's really no excuse left in the world for serving anything other than a really beautifully textured milk drink. Even if you can't pour latte out on the top, it should still have great texture. That technology is now very much available. So a couple of quick things, you can program your milk temperature. It has a little thermocouple on the end of the steam wand there that senses the milk's temperature and stops at the right point. You can adjust texture of the milk as well and one neat little feature is when you're finished steaming, when you push the steam wand back in, it purges itself automatically. Again, just thoughtful use of technology to make our lives a little bit easier. A few quick likes and don't likes. Things I like: The touchscreen. Actually, it's great. This is not a Wi-Fi enabled machine, but having a touchscreen means you can do walkthroughs for setting it up, you can do troubleshooting, you can offer a lot of guidance. The touchscreen is perfectly fine in terms of usability. I think that's a really nice upgrade to these kind of machines. I think the steaming is excellent. One thing, and I particularly love, is that when you remove the drip tray and if you twist the dial, you can just move your machine around the counter really really easily. That's just great. I love that you can load water in the top, so you can fill it from the front if you've put your machine in your kitchen it's the back, but you still have a fully removable water tank that can be accessed from the back. That's kind of nice thinking. Things I don't love as much: The grinder does suffer the same problem that many other grinders do, which is as it gets hotter as you use it more, it's grind setting does shift a little bit. So what I would tend to do is, because I would just make a couple of drinks in the morning and that was it, I would have the machine switch itself on, about half an hour before I wanted to get up, it was nice and hot, I would come down, pull a shot, clean up, be done. If I had to pull two, three, four or five shots, then I know my grind would change, but at the end of doing that, I would just reset my grinder back to the original lumber. That way when I woke up the next morning and it was ready to pull it's first shot of the day, it was at the right grind setting and grind settings held pretty well for me in testing. For me, the grinder is okay, I kind of wish I had more control again and again, I wish I had a little bit more control over the dose going in. Typically these doses are pretty high and that's not how I usually brew coffee. So again, I'm probably not the target audience here, but I have to be honest in the things that I would want to change or want more control over. And lastly, there is the price point. It's 2,000 pounds. That's not cheap and that I know that's not a bad thing, you get a really well built, good quality machine, you get good support in the UK and other places, but you can't help but mention that price, it's a little bit higher than a lot of other domestic bean to cups. That said, I would anticipate that you're gonna have a lot less issues. This can run you through your own descaling programs, it's just less parts to go wrong compared to a traditional bean to cup. In summary, if you are an espresso obsessive and you wanna play with your coffee, this is probably not the machine for you. It won't offer you enough control, enough granularity about your coffee brewing. If you're someone who does actually want that coffee at home, cappuccinos in the morning, a little flat white, but you don't want a new hobby, well I guess Sage have built this machine for you and I have to say they've done a pretty good job. Thank you very much for watching.", "videoID": "fRBOxyu2b2Q"}, {"title": "The Best USA \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Grocery Store Coffee", "text": "Today we are looking for the best American grocery store coffee. Which of these big brands should you buy if you're stuck in the supermarket and you don't know which one to choose? The way it's gonna work is this: we're gonna run a giant head-to-head tournament. We've got 32 coffees here, so across five rounds we will get to an ultimate winner, and I have no idea what it's gonna be. Now, when you're watching me taste these I won't know what I'm tasting. You might see these little alphanumeric codes on the glasses. That's kind of the process of a kind of blind taste testing, so I have no idea what it is, but we'll make sure you can see what it is I'm tasting. And I've gotta tell you, I'm incredibly excited. I have wanted to taste a bunch of these brands for years. I've never had Folgers. I've never had Chock Full o'Nuts. I've never had Eight O'clock Coffee. There's loads here I've yet to try, so I'm excited to try them. And I don't really know what to expect, so I guess we should get on with it. Get on with round one and begin the tasting. Now, if I don't like the coffee that you like, and you've bought that coffee for ages, please don't think that's me saying you've got bad taste in coffee. The only takeaway I would say is, like, maybe there's a coffee here or elsewhere that you could enjoy more of that kind of a style. But I'm not out to offend people who like the coffee brands that I really don't, even if I have very strong negative reactions to them. Now, before we dive in, I should probably tell you what I think good coffee is. I will tend to prefer coffees that have a natural sweetness to them, that are complex tasting, that have very limited negative flavors. Again, the other way, I probably won't enjoy things that are harsh or very bitter, that have kind of rubbery, earthy, kind of woody flavors to them. I just don't enjoy those as much. Now, at the end of this, you'll work out my favorite coffee, but I'll also, at the end of it, give you some recommendations from everything we tasted across different roast levels. So it's not just maybe what I think is the best light tasting coffee, but also the best medium, the best dark roasted coffee here too. But it's time to begin, and I have no idea where we're beginning. Wish me luck. A difficult first round. This one, more bitter, kind of rougher tasting, but this one kind of weirdly papery and not really that enjoyable. So surprisingly, I might push through the darker roast. Yeah, something about this is just kind of weird and empty. This one, just way darker, way harsher. This one, much more pleasant in comparison. An easy win. Vegetables. Also vegetables. Probably this is the winner for just being a little bit less harsh, that tiny fraction sweeter, but they taste actually very similar. Super harsh, really no sweetness. Much, much, much better than this. Just like more sweetness, a little bit more complexity, kind of okay. Little chocolate, little roasty, but a little chocolate. Ugh. No, I know what you are. You're the one with chicory. You're the chicory one. Not for me. If you really enjoy this coffee, that's okay. I just really don't like this taste profile. Personally, I much prefer something with a bit more sweetness. This is really kind of weird. I can imagine maybe with a lot of cream it would be okay, but as black coffee, I'm not having a nice time. Heavily bitter. Okay, it's a lighter roast. It's kind of vegetabley though, like peas, green peas, but I think I'd rather drink this than that, so this is the winner. Okay, a little bit of sweet, kind of nice. Slightly darker. This one is the sweeter of the two, and for me, a little bit more complex. It's the winner. Pretty harsh, pretty bitter. Very roasty. Very, very, very bitter. This one also dark and roasty, but not as dark and roasty. Not loving either one, to be honest. Really not having a great time with either one. Begrudgingly, I will put this one through as the winner. Like a nice vegetable soup with a twist of lemon. No, no, I was a little harsh to this one. This one is lighter. It's got more complexity. It's quite sweet. It's got a little acidity going on here. This is the more interesting of the two. I feel a bit mean kicking this one out this early, 'cause it's actually not that bad compared to a lot of other stuff that might have made it through so far. But this is the winner. Acidity. This is a lighter roast. This is kind of interesting. It's weird, I don't know how light it really is, but in the spectrum of things today so far, it's pretty light. This one , weird. Super bitter for not super dark roasted. It feels dark roasted, but it has this additional bitterness that is quite surprising. This is just a much more interesting cup of coffee all around. The winner. Little dark, little diesely, like upper end of medium to me. Not fully dark roasted, but pretty dark. Super woody, like, super, super woody. Nothing else, like slightly burnt wood, and that's kind of it. This, I don't really enjoy it, but it's definitely the better of the two. It's burnt and it's woody. Oh no, it's burnt, and it's woody, and it's nutty, and it's slightly like musty tasting too. So again, worse coffees have been knocked out than this winner, but this is the one that's gonna progress to the next round. Little acid. Little acidity in there. Little complexity. Not necessarily the favorite flavors of mine, but okay. We're back to kind of peanut shells. Harsh, bitter. This is kind of weird, but it's definitely a more interesting cup of coffee than this one here, so for that reason, I will put it through. It's that classic, classic dark roast profile. Just all roast flavor. That's kind of it. That's the problem for me. This is really interesting. This feels like a very similar cup of coffee, but fractionally lighter roasted. So this is the one that's gonna go through this time. Okay, lighter roast, little bit of caramel in there, little bit of vegetables. No, it tastes like straw and jute. Tastes a little old and agey in terms of the old, sort of the raw coffee was a little bit old. This is a better cup of coffee, but this is more complex, some acidity, some sweet. This just tastes like the green coffee's had its... You know, had better days. I don't how to say this, but it reminds me of burnt ice cream in the worst way. Really like a creamy texture, but very harsh and bitter. Kind of the same. This is a tough one. Tough decision. I'm gonna put this one through for just being a bit weird. There's something about its texture, it's got a slight sort of spiciness to it and a creaminess, and that's really unusual and confusing in a cup of coffee. Which brings us to the end of round one. And I'm feeling a little bit weird, but we're doing okay. I've probably offended most people at this point who buy coffee from the grocery store. That isn't really the intention. But now we're gonna get into more interesting head-to-heads, more competitive. Let's see what happens. Let's hope everything gets better from here on up. Okay, you're still pretty roasty. Little bit kind of like peas, little bit vegetabley, but much sweeter, much more enjoyable, much less bitter cup of coffee. You proceed. Okay, little developed. Caramelly though. Ooh, now, very similar cups of coffee. Surprisingly similar cups of coffee. I wonder what they are. I don't know what the brands involved here are, but these are staggeringly similar cups of coffee, shockingly similar cups of coffee. I'm really kind of struggling to pick them apart. Okay, this is the winner. It's fractionally sweeter. That is less bitter. It is more sweet. It's a little bit more enjoyable and complex, but they're really quite close. Okay, little bit of vegetables,  little bit more bitter. Difficult call. I'm gonna go with the one that's a little less bitter, little bit sweeter, which is you. I'm not a huge fan of either, if I'm honest, but this is probably the better of the two. Ooh. It's surprising you made it through. Really super dark. Not a lot else going on there. Vanilla, caramel, interesting, friendly. An easy, easy win for this cup here. Okay, that's the one that had some acidity to it. Also some acidity, but less. This one is a light roast or lighter in the great scheme of things. This one is also light, but it's got a bit more brightness, acidity, complexity there. This one is not unpleasant, but actually lacks a little bit of character in comparison to this one here. So my winner. Back to more developed roasts again. Ooh, surprising that both of these made it through. This one is less dark, bit sweeter, bit more kind of soft and enjoyable in comparison. Winner. So this decision I just need to talk about, because I got it wrong, and I think it's the only one that I got wrong, but I do think I got this wrong. And I don't really understand why. I don't really understand what happened. But of all the judgements I make in this whole video, this one I think I messed up, and I just wanted to interject and say that. I think I was definitely struggling with tasting so many coffees of such different roast levels, that was surprisingly tricky. But yeah, I just couldn't let this one mishap go free. Little dark but not too harsh actually, kind of developed. Much harsher. No, no, no. Yes, this is, for like a medium, fully developed medium roast, a little acidity. It's got some stuff going on. This is definitely my preference. Okay, friendly , weird. Okay, I know it did well 'cause it was weird last time. This is the better cup of the two for me. A bit more acidity, a bit more complexity, and, frankly, just kind of less weird. If you have made it this far, and you wanna know more about how we're brewing these coffees, how we're tasting, the process of tasting coffee, I'll leave you a playlist on how to taste coffee, how to develop that skill down below, so you can learn more. That's the end of this round. On next to the quarter finals. Still like a little presence of roast there, but not too dark, nicely developed. Softer, spicier. Is it better? Difficult matchup. You know, they're kind of at a level, I would say. There's not a lot between them. I'll give the edge to this one here, but know that it wasn't a big victory. This one's lighter, brighter, bit more acidity, but it's not truly better in terms of flavor and complexity. There's something I like about this in comparison. It's caramelier, it's kind of sweeter. This has a little bit more zing, but I'm not sure I like it. I'm gonna put this one through. Controversial decision, perhaps. That's just a more approachable, enjoyable cup of coffee. A bit friendlier. Okay, little peanuty, little harsh. Much more interesting as a cup of coffee. It's a much lighter roast, but I think it's just a cleaner, sweeter cup of coffee. This one, I kind of have some issues with still. So this is a pretty easy win. Light, bright, clean, sweet. Similar, interesting these matchups are still happening. This has a slightly kind of grassier, straw-like quality to it that makes it just slightly less enjoyable than this one here. It's just a bit more kind of put together and enjoyable and balanced. That's the winner. It's semifinal time, and now I'm kind of curious whether, you know, this semifinal might be the actual final or not, but I'm probably more curious which coffee I've said nice things about that I'll be kind of shocked I said nice things about. I still don't what I've tasted yet. This has been so interesting, and a journey, a journey. Anyway, semifinals time. Nice, sweet kind of chocolate. Got a little fruit suddenly. I don't think I've noticed that before, but it's got a little bit of black fruit in there that this one does not have. This is so interesting. This now tastes kind of roasty in comparison to this, and this tastes fruity and juicy and enjoyable, so that's my winner. It's just amazing how these have changed by having different coffees to compare them to. Comparative tasting is so, so interesting. Okay, sweet, caramels, friendly, nice. More acidity, bit lighter, bit brighter. This is tricky. This is lighter and I'm drawn to lighter roasts, but it just feels a little bit empty in comparison to this. I would say maybe 85, 90 people out of 100 would probably prefer this one to this one, and that is in the back of my head. Yeah, I'm gonna put it through. I'm gonna put this one through. This one has some nice fruit. It's interesting, but I think this one's probably just a little bit more complete and balanced in comparison. Gotta tell you, I'm curious and stressed. I honestly don't know what's gonna be a winner here. I don't know which one I'm gonna say is the best of the grocery store coffees. Anyway, let's taste the last two. Some acidity, friendly, caramelly, not a bad cup of coffee. Doing kind of black fruit kind of nicely. It's a bit darker as a roast. I'd call that a medium and I'd probably call that a light actually, in the scheme of this whole tasting anyway. I'm torn. Now it's like this, it's really hard to pick. There's issues I have with both of them. This one feels a little underdeveloped. This one feels a little overdeveloped, little dark. I would say though, as like a paper filtered brew, this will probably clean this up a little bit. Before I tell you the result, I'm telling my favorite. Don't forget, I'm gonna tell you the best of which I think are the light, medium, and dark roasts that we have disqualified and knocked out. So there'll be a few recommendations after this one. I'm gonna go with it, I'm gonna go, this one has the most character. It has the most fruit. It's not a perfect cup of coffee, but I think it's kind of interesting. It tastes of somewhere, and that for me is a win. So I'm gonna say of the coffees we've tasted today, this is gonna be my pick. I don't what it is. Can I have this one please? Can you let me know what the disqualified coffee was? Oh, oh, destroying the place. Tim Hortons, no way! Okay, that's genuinely astonishing. That's shocking to me. I feel like that's genuinely surprising. I had a cup of Tim Hortons coffee some years ago, and I did not have a very good time. That's astonishing. I'm shocked. Let me find out what the winner is now. Oh, Silken Splendor. Philz, interesting. Is there any information  on what I've tasted here? As you can hear, this is the one exception, and this is interesting, the one exception to everything, which is we could buy almost everything pre-ground, this, however, came as beans. So it was grounded in an appropriate level. Did this give it an advantage? I don't know, but it definitely tastes like there's some interesting coffee in here. I am stunned by the results. I really wanna know how everything else kind of came out. I don't know what this means, but you can watch back, I guess, and know what tasted like what. Let me now go and taste everything one more time and give you some recommendations for the best dark, the best medium and the best light. So it turns out I needed a little bit more time and a haircut to think about these coffees, taste them again, and come back to you with some good advice. But before that, I can't help mention we have new Weird Coffee Person merch. We have this designed by Taylor Naoko, which I think is wonderful, if you need a brain taking a bath in delicious coffee, and I think that's what we all do every day. There's a Loveramics mug, there's a T-shirt, there's a print. Those are available now. There's a link down below. These are, of course, limited edition, so be quick. Let's talk about the coffees. Now, going back and tasting these again was definitely, definitely interesting. The Caribou, this was the lightest, I think, coffee here, and I think it kind of was made to feel a bit empty in comparison to everything else. But if you like light roast, if you don't like any roast in your coffee, then I think this is probably the lightest thing we tasted. I feel it was just maybe missing a bit of sweetness, a bit of complexity. But if you want light, light, light roasted coffee, this would be it. In the medium roasted category, it was kind of interesting. I think Dunkin' showed really well. I'm genuinely impressed by this. Tim Hortons, also, a little bit of a surprise. Both much more complex coffees in these bags than I've perhaps experienced in the stores over the years, but I haven't been to either one recently, so maybe I'm missing out. Starbucks, just kind of solid, dependable, very medium, medium roast. You know, I don't think I disliked anything about it particularly. You know, they buy good coffees, generally speaking, so, you know, this was a decent showing. The controversial final recommendation would be for a dark roast. I ended up thinking this was probably the best thing there. I think in the head-to-heads it lost out by being fractionally darker than the stuff it was up against, but I think the raw coffees in this are probably better, and so if you really like dark roasted coffee, this might be the better recommendation of the dark roasts that I tasted, even though I kicked it out a little bit early, I think, perhaps unfairly, which I think I mentioned in the video. But as for our winner, congratulations to Philz. A surprise to me. I don't really know their coffee.", "videoID": "pfqvTCgglYA"}, {"title": "Cloth Filters for Coffee", "text": "Today, we're gonna be talking about what might be my favorite type of filtration for coffee brewing. That's using a cloth filter for coffee. Broadly speaking, there are three types of filtration for coffee. There's actually more, but we'll just go with three for now. The most common one, the one that most people are familiar with is using a paper filter, something like a V60 or a Kalita or an AeroPress. And paper does a really good job of filtering out all of the fine pieces of coffee, all of the big pieces of coffee and usually all of the oils as well. At the other end of the spectrum, you have metal filters; something like a French press. That's a big metal screen. And that will typically let through more, especially more very fine pieces. Cloth for me is the best of both worlds. It sits right in the middle. It doesn't let through any fine pieces of coffee. So you have crystal clear looking coffee, but it does let through I think a little bit more of the oils. You have a different texture when it comes to the brew. Cloth filters are very common around the world. You'll see things like this often called Nel drippers in places like Japan. You'll see things like coffee socks in lots of parts of the world which is just like a long bag that you brew coffee in. The reason I love it is this perfect kind of hybrid of clarity and texture. And while you might think you'd wanna use it for heavier bodied coffees, I actually like using lighter bodied coffees in there. Things like washed Ethiopian coffees or washed Kenyan coffees, because it gives them this extra kind of richness, and heaviness and makes me wanna use all the words that give people like me a terrible reputation for just talking nonsense about coffee. But I can't stress enough how much I love cloth filtered coffee. So you might be thinking, if it's so good, why wouldn't I just use it all the time? They have a bad reputation. For kind of a good reason, it's not that they can't brew coffee, it's not that it's difficult to work with, it's difficult to clean and to keep clean. Maintaining a cloth filter is annoying, frustrating hard work. And for many people, it's not the return on investment that they want. For that extra work, it is the improvement in your coffee enough to justify how much work you have to do. Now, many people don't do the work and have a bad experience because it's really easy to make a cloth filter taste bad. You know what happens when you forget your washing in the washing machine for like a day and it smells terrible. Well, that's the growth of mildew inside your laundry. And that's what gives it that bad smell. Mildew loves to grow in wet cotton basically. That's like a perfect breeding ground. This right now is wet cotton. It's really easy to have that taste, to have that smell appear in a cloth filter. It's really easy to make them taste disgusting; because they trap little pieces of coffee, bits of oil in there, no matter how much you rinse them. Well, they taste like old oxidized coffee and forgotten laundry. And that, that is not what you wanna taste in your morning cup of coffee. I've talked about this being a lot of work to maintain a filter. Well, what exactly is involved? The worst thing you can do, is just use it, rinse it out and then leave it to dry on the side. That slow drying process seems to be when most of the bad smells and bad tastes appear in the cloth. So don't do that. Immediately after using it, let it drain out as much as possible, and then dump as much as you can of the grounds inside into the rubbish bin. Just get rid of those. Then you're gonna take it to the sink and wash out as much as you can from the filter. It's unlikely you're gonna do a perfect job here. Chances are, there'll be a few little pieces you just can't quite get out that look just embedded in the fiber. Don't freak out too much about that. It's gonna be okay. What you need to do now, is keep that wet until you use it again. If you're gonna use cloth every single day, then I would store the cloth in a glass in the fridge keep it cold, keep it completely soaked in water. And when you're ready to use it again, obviously throw that water out, give it a very good rinse, a preheat, and then you're good to go. If you wanna use it now and again, wash it as much as you possibly can and then put it in a bag, put it in the freezer. Leave it frozen until you need to use it again. And again, just run it under hot water to defrost it. There is some theory that freezing repeatedly will slightly degrade the quality of the cotton. I haven't had so many issues with that over the years. One last tip is that over time, you will slowly stain the cloth; and there is a way to undo that and actually give it a really, really really good clean. This stuff, this isn't necessarily a brand endorsement. I just know that this particular brand does work quite well. I spoke to someone from Onex many years ago, and asked them about what was the best thing to clean coffee. And they said, \"Use this;\" because this formulation for espresso machine cleaning, was actually based on their original formulation that they use to clean the cloths in giant earn brewers that people used to use back in the day. A teaspoon of this into hot water, leave your filter to soak in it, and it will come back shockingly clean. Like it does a really good job of getting rid of stain. You will have to rinse that a life out of it to get rid of any traces of smell or odor over the soap basically. But once you've done that, it's good to go. And it's really, really, really good at bringing a cloth filter back to looking good and tasting good again. To talk more about brewing with them, what I'm gonna do in a minute is brew one of these. And I'll also brew a V60 to talk about the difference in taste between those two things. But before I do that, I've got two things to talk about. Firstly, this video has a coffee giveaway.

So let's brew some coffee. I'm gonna brew this almost identically to how I brew a V60. If you don't know how that works, look up here. So bloom two to one to that of V60. I'm gonna give it a gentle swirl just to mix everything together and make sure we've got no pockets of dry coffee causing trouble. Now, a lot of the time in different parts of the world you see a lot of different techniques. Some people like to keep a very low bed, that doesn't bother me as much. I don't mind filling the filter up a little bit more like I would do a V60, I like that higher thermal mass. And I don't worry about water leaking out of the sides of the cloth. If you look at it, you can actually see very little is coming through the cloth. Mostly it's filtering through the coffee and out of the bottom. Now, a cloth filter has a little bit less resistance. That means your brews will be a little bit quicker. And obviously it has a little bit less resistance because it lets through a little bit more. It's literally bigger gaps between the fibers than there are in paper. As such with the same grind they would produce, say a three minute 30 brew for 30 to 560 on V60. Well here, it might brew in three minutes. That doesn't really encourage me to change the grind that much though, because it doesn't really have a massive impact on the extraction, the way that a changing grind would. However, if you do wanna go a little bit finer, that may just bring out a little bit more texture and up your extraction a little bit if you feel something is missing. So that brew finished just under three minutes, like 2:55 which is about what I'd expect for the same grind size that would produce a three minute 30 brew in a V60 with one of the quicker V60 papers. Generally speaking, I would let this cool down enough to touch before I try and clean it up. I don't worry too much about staining or that kinda stuff 'cause that's easy to fix later. So just leave it in the sink, leave it in the spare mug, leave it somewhere, drink your coffee, and enjoy it and then deal with this thing afterwards. So it's time for taste comparison. I have a delicious brew of coffee here; and conveniently, I have a delicious V60 here as well. So we have two brews. They are the same coffee, same grind setting, same dose, same water, same technique really. The primary difference is filtration method though, this brew did take maybe 20 seconds longer to filter than this one. Now this is quite a light roasted coffee. It's quite a light-bodied coffee. It's a washed Ethiopian coffee. It's very floral, very pretty, not a ton of texture to it but it's bright and clean in a V60 and very lovely. What about cloth? So good! So good! It just feels really lovely to drink. The texture and mouthfeel of cloth filtered coffee made well is a thing of beauty. It's my favorite filtration method for this reason. You get all of the clarity of a paper filtered coffee, with this extra layer of pleasure and delight on top. It really is so lovely to drink. If I'm gonna get just very pretentious, I would say it's like drinking coffee as silk, your coffee turned to velvet. I'm aware I sound ridiculous talking about coffee this way to most people, but I'm having a good time. So yeah, broadly speaking, if you're someone who loves ritual and routine, you can probably make a cloth filter work. It's all about not forgetting to do something. It's all about remembering to rinse it properly, remembering to keep it damp and kind of wet and cold the whole time or remembering to put it in the freezer, remembering to get it out at the right time. Remembering all these little pieces. If you're very good at building habits and rituals, then I think it's a very rewarding thing. If you're like me where you're barely functional before coffee, and you're quite chaotic and forgetful at times, you'll annoy yourself. 'Cause you'll have just left it out for a day and you'll be frustrated at the amount of work you have to do to bring it back to being a good tasting filter. It can always be brought back unless it's growing mold or something truly disgusting, but it can usually be brought back to being a good filter again, if you're willing to put in the work. How much it returns on that, is really down to how much you enjoy your coffee this way. I really do enjoy coffee this way. And so it's right on the cusp of a return on investment of my time. I use paper. I like paper because I like the brew and it's easy. And actually that matters to me. And I'm okay with that. The results from cloth, are wonderful.", "videoID": "dr_I3ZVKKb4"}, {"title": "1 Cup V60 Part 2\uff1a You Had A Lot Of Questions!", "text": "This video is sponsored by Squarespace. Today we're making a little follow up video to the V60 technique for a one cup brewer that I published I think just a few days ago. Now I'm very happy with that technique, I'm very proud of that technique, but it did generate a bunch of questions, and I thought it was appropriate to make a video to answer as many of them as I could to kind of clarify a few things around the brewing technique including the most controversial one of all. Was I wrong? Did I give you bad advice? We shall find out. Anyway, here's how it's gonna work. There's about 10 different questions or topics that I wanna talk about today. We're just gonna go through them one by one and hopefully answer the many different questions that you had. So the first question is kind of a question around swirling versus stirring the bloom. Generally, I like swirling the bloom for a few reasons. It's quick, it's easy, it requires no additional tools. It's pretty easy to be consistent. But as I point out in the video excessive swirling can kind of clog the paper. And for people that have a grinder that produces say more than average fines, it's a cheaper grinder. Is this still the best thing to do? And I would say maybe but it's probably worth trying a stir. A stir is something I used to recommend before I kind of got into swirling. Stirring might be a better way. The goal is just to make sure that all of the coffee is getting wet as soon as possible without excessive agitation of the coffee. If you stir one bit a lot, you'll start the extraction of that bit going more aggressively and you maybe don't wanna to do that. So, you're just looking to have a kind of even distribution of water from the beginning. And again, you're just trying to get the grounds that you can see that are still dry into the mix and that's it. So really not too much work, not too much stirring going on. Just a thorough mixing of water and coffee. When it comes to the end of the brew though, I would still recommend that just gentle swirl at the end. You don't need to use a spoon a second time. Now, a lot of people asked can you use the same technique on a two cup brewer? And there's kind of two ways to interpret this question so I'll start with the the easy one. Can you use 15 grams to 250 and the same ratios and everything else in a two cup brewer? And the answer is 100%, yes. They are, as far as the coffee's concerned, pretty much identical. The hole at the bottom is the same size, the angle is the same, the ridges inside are the same. So all the same things apply. If you've only got a two cup brewer, you don't need to buy an additional one cup brewer. A two cup will work well for a single 15 gram dose of coffee brewed to 250 mils. Don't worry about it. The more complex question would be could I scale this technique up all the way to say 30 to 500 grams? And I guess you probably could and it would probably work well. I like the original V60 technique because it was kind of the simplest technique to get to good coffee. And I know that didn't work across the entire range as well as I hoped, as in it wasn't perfect for a one cup brew. But I think for two cup brew, I really like it. I think it's simple. Relatively easy to do and easy to be consistent with. But if you wanna experiment with this, please do. I haven't done all the work to calculate, you know what the ideal pour rate is for that deeper, heavier bed of coffee, but it should still basically work well. If you do experiment, compare the two. Let me know your thoughts down in the comments below. Another very common question was about applying this technique to flatbed brewers. These are brewers like the April that I have here, or the Kalita or the Stagg or a bunch of others, sort of flatbed brewers. And the answer is probably, but I don't know. To try and come up with a good technique, we do a lot of testing and that is kind of going narrow and deep. We haven't done a lot of testing with this brewer. We haven't done a lot of testing with other brewers either. It is on the agenda, it's on the list of things we would like to do, but I can't with all certainty say yes, this will work perfectly well on those brewers. Though I can't immediately see an issue with the technique in terms of why it wouldn't work well, but if you experiment, again, let us know down in the comments below what worked and what didn't. So let's talk grind size because this is very heavily requested topic, particularly for the Comandante, where people asked how many clicks on the Comandante was my grind setting. And the answer is, for the Comandante, a little easier than the other one. The answer here is around 25 to 30, really depends on the coffee, it depends on the water that you're using as well. But it was that kind of a ballpark there for light roasts. For more developed medium roasts, I might be a little coarser. For dark roasts, I might be coarser again still. I don't really feel comfortable giving say a sort of target micron range of like 600 microns as a target size because particle size distributions are extremely variable. And just because your peak is there, it doesn't mean your total surface area matches mine. So your extraction will be different, your flavor will be different, your experience will be different. The best guidance remains, frustratingly, taste. Does it taste good? Does it taste empty, hollow? Is it missing something? Does it taste a little dry and a little bitter? You know, those are the kind of taste feedback things that you're looking for to guide you to the right grind size. But yeah, that's kind of it. I would say if you're desperate to know, start maybe around 30 for a typical coffee on here. You might need to go finer, you might need to go a touch coarser. But that's the kind of ballpark from absolute zero on the Comandante that I have here in the studio. Another common question was why did we use 10 second pauses between the pulses? Why that particular number? And that's a good question. We did experiment with longer pauses and letting the bed drain out, you know, entirely. What we saw there was once the water drains outta the bed, that bed rapidly cools down, which is kind of interesting, it just loses its thermal mass and it cools down and your next pulse heats it back up again, but not as much. And so we found that keeping sort of some water in the cone at all times helped with temperature stability throughout the brew. But that 10 seconds helped stretch the brew out, increase the contact time, give the bed a chance to settle again and not constantly be churned over and over again. Which could lead to more unevenness, more channeling potentially. There may be a better number. This may be 12 or 15, but 10 seemed nice, easy, easy to replicate. And that is a big part of what I'm chasing with the techniques which is it's easy to remember and it's easy to do, because the more finicky and overly specific it gets, and I know this is a more complex technique already than the original, but if I take it even further than that, it's just more frustrating to make coffee that way especially before you've had coffee. Now the next two questions are kind of linked to each other. It's about established and existing techniques that were out there ahead of time. One question is often is this just Matt Winton's recipe? Now, if you don't know Matt Winton he is a very skilled coffee professional. He's won the World Brewer's Cup and he has a five pour technique on HARIO's website and I'll link that down below. You can check it out. His is a little different. It's not as focused on kind of controlling agitation the same way that mine is. And I think he's using a slightly coarser grind and going for a different style of brew. But I still think it's a good technique and I still think we probably ended up at the same place for very similar reasons. I didn't watch his technique before making the video. I didn't really watch anyone's techniques. The way that we do testing is we kind of go variable by variable and then slowly start to build it up into a total recipe and test it out and see what works. So, I was aware of him and I had sort of a vague recollection of it, but I wasn't sure of it. But I think if you brewed his recipe and mine side by side there'd be a different level of extraction. I suspect I'm chasing a slightly higher overall extraction in terms of technique and style and end cup. But I think both would potentially be delicious, I hope. Coffee has no one good answer. And so, I would definitely recommend trying his version of the technique and seeing what you like and what you don't. The other question I got a lot was is this just Tetsu's 4:6 method sort of with a new spin? And the answer is, I don't think so. Again, there are a bunch of similarities and again, I suspect we ended up at similar places for similar reasons. As I've said, what I'm chasing with mine is replicable agitation and kind of control over the sort of entire brew. I think the 4:6 method is designed to be a much more flexible brew method where you kind of push and pull extraction around in different places to end up with different results. I think that's interesting, but it's ultimately a very different philosophy of coffee brewing. And again, I suspect the coffees that we each brew often or were sort of being brewed for that method and what I'm using might be a little bit different. Like I said, there's no one good answer. If you haven't tried it, you should totally try it. Moving on. One question that has popped up a few times is, can you use a WDT tool to kind of do a stirred bloom phase? What some people are calling the wet WDT technique or the WWDT just to make things impossibly complicated. Now there's been a few people have talked about using these as part of the kind of bloom process. I think it definitely is interesting. If you have one, have a play with it. It's kind of fun. It's amazing how clean these things come out having stirred wet ground coffee. They seem to come out pristinely clean, which is wonderful. It's worth an experiment. It's absolutely not worth buying one of these just to make a V60 with, but if you've got one in your coffee making setup, then yes, have a little play. I like the brews I get, but I'm constantly chasing the least possible tools and sort of stuff in my coffee making. So I tend not to use it. I think in espresso, it's getting to the point of being essential in a lot of home espresso prep. But for a V60, fun to play with. And if you think it really improves your cup, then keep with it. But, but overall, just an interesting little sort of mixture of different styles of coffee prep in one place. Now we have to talk about the elephant in the room. The thing that was the most controversial thing I said in that video. The thing that got the most criticism and the thing in which people think I am the most wrong about.

So it's time to address the area in which I might have been wrong. I might have made a mistake. I might have caused some controversy. Pretty mild controversy, frankly. The topic is preheating the brewer when you're rinsing the paper. I said it's perfectly acceptable to use the hot water from a kitchen tap 'cause I thought it was less wasteful and many of you disagreed with that and it's gonna take us to some strange places in terms of an answer, right? So one quick thing. Let me tell you why I prefer to use hot water from a kitchen sink. A few different reasons. Firstly, the hot water turns up pretty quickly most of the time. And so, I don't feel particularly wasteful when I run the hot tap. If yours takes ages to come through, yes, that should definitely factor into your decision. Secondly, I don't like sort of boiling water in a kettle to pour through this thing because that water's either gonna be tap water which is really hard and I'll get scale in my kettle. I don't want that. Or it's gonna be my coffee water which is ultimately relatively expensive and I don't really wanna waste that either. I make recipe water for all the sort of water we brew with here. So it's always consistent across testing, across videos, all that stuff. So that's why I like the hot water from the hot tap. If you do wanna use water from a kettle that I want you to use as little as possible. If you just pour your hot water on top and have it drain through, it does very little preheating with the plastic brewer. It really makes almost no difference at all. So you kind of need a steep phase. To do that, the best way, make sure your sink is clean obviously. Put your brewer in the sink and you know if the sink base is a little bit wet this will kind of form a seal and you can pour hot water in it, it will just sit in the brewer and very slowly drain through and do much better kind of thermal transfer. Much better heating of the brewer. A few of you suggested another way of preheating the brewer that is kind of interesting. I'll show it to you now. It makes me unsettled and I can't really explain to you why. A lot of you suggested using a kettle sort of to preheat the brewer by using the brewer as a lid for the kettle. And like I said, this feels kind of weird. Don't put it on this way 'cause it turns out this does nothing useful. It just makes the base of the V60 warm and the cone, the bit that you need to be warm, doesn't get that much warmer it turns out. So you've gotta put it on upside down like a funny little hat. I don't like it. It works, right, if you put it on this way around and you boil your kettle. Yeah, that, that's preheated, that's a hot brewer now. So that definitely works. But it's definitely not how your kettle is designed to be used. And so that kind of freaks me out a little bit. Obviously not every kettle has the right sized hole at the top. Some kettles have little lids, that's not gonna work. So in many cases this is probably not a viable option, but in some cases it may well be. Like I said, it feels weird to me to recommend it, but I can't deny it.", "videoID": "v5WQ1sZzW4o"}, {"title": "Kopi Luwak\u29f8Civet Poop Coffee\uff1a Disgusting or Delightful\uff1f", "text": "Today, we're talking about Kopi Luwak. It's one of the most expensive coffees you'll see out there. The price is often kind of a big deal. I know there are more expensive coffees, but Kopi Luwak does still technically hold the Guinness World Record for the most expensive coffee. I get a lot of messages about it. Is it worth the money? Is it a good idea? Does it taste better? Do people really drink it? If you're not familiar with Kopi Luwak, here is a quick summary. Kopi Luwak translates from the Indonesian as 'civet coffee'. It's made by collecting the droppings of an Asian palm civet that has been eating coffee cherries. And from its faeces, you can recover the undigested seeds that you can then clean up, roast, brew, and drink. You'll see it also sold as sometimes 'ferret coffee' or 'weasel coffee' if it comes from neighboring producing countries in that kind of a region. The marketing story is that there is a kind of novel fermentation that goes on inside the gut of the palm civet that changes the coffee. It ends up producing what's supposed to be a less bitter, smoother, delightful cup of coffee. Is this true? How did anyone even find this out? Would I recommend that you try it? Is it the real deal or is it just some kind of coffee equivalent of ortolan for the caffeine-hungry faecophile? Have I tried Kopi Luwak? I don't know. I honestly don't know. I might have done, but I don't know. Let me explain. And to do that, we should begin with the origin stories of Kopi Luwak. It's the 19th century, Dutch colonists have come to Indonesia, and seeing the opportunity of cheap land and cheap labor, have forced local people to grow coffee for them. Now, in typical fashion, those people are not allowed to enjoy or consume any of the coffee they're growing. They can't enjoy the fruits of their labors. But a few of them notice that the civets are eating the coffee. And then they notice that the civets are leaving the seeds in their stool intact. And some brave soul decides to kind of wash them off, roast them, grind them, brew them, and declares it to be delicious. And the Dutch, seeing some value that they're not extracting, well they jump on that and start exporting it too. And that's the beginnings of Kopi Luwak. And this is a story you see repeated in the marketing copy of lots of companies who sell this, kind of with a straight face. It's not a good story. Coffee has a lot of worse stories. There's some terrible stories in coffee's history, but this is not a good one and not really worth celebrating. But that's the origins of Kopi Luwak. Kopi Luwak lives around the fringes of coffee for a while. And then in 2003, Oprah Winfrey brings it to the forefront by brewing some on telly. And then in 2007, there is a film called \"The Bucket List\" that really catapults Kopi Luwak into the public conscious. - Jack Nicholson: Kopi Luwak - I heard about copy Kopi Luwak pretty early on in my career, and I kind of understood the draw of it. People like to taste disgusting things that are also kind of safe. People like to kind of push their boundaries. So I kind of understood the desire for people to taste something like this. But I don't think people really understood the implications of their interest in it. Now, up until this point, the production of Kopi Luwak had been incredibly small, estimates were in the kind of low hundreds of kilos per year on the upper end. And suddenly there's this huge demand for it. People were willing to pay very high prices for it. And then no one really knows what it's supposed to taste like. Inevitably, supply is gonna find a way to meet that demand, and the first thing to kind of scale up to do it was fraud. Now, this basically meant people were taking low grades of coffee and basically saying, \"No, no, this is Kopi Luwak.\" And you would taste it and you would say, \"This doesn't taste very nice.\" And they could kind of wave it away by saying, \"Well, what did you expect?\" You know, fraud has happened in coffee over the years in lots of different places. It wasn't uncommon for people to smuggle coffee across borders, let's say from Ecuador to Columbia, because Columbian coffee was able to attain a higher price than Ecuadorian coffee at the time. This was a different kind of fraud, but it led to scientific analysis to kind of understand if there were actual chemical markers to prove that Kopi Luwak was Kopi Luwak. And it turns out there are. You can do assessments of the aromatic compounds and other aspects of the raw coffee, and say definitively this is from the gut of an Asian palm civet or it's not. But no one's doing those tests. There's no real incentive to do them for many people. They just wanna sell this thing at a premium price, and they don't wanna take a chance that what they have isn't the real deal. I think way back in sort of 2005, 2006, someone told me that four times more Kopi Luwak was sold than was actually produced. And this was before \"The Bucket List\" kicked everything off, so I'd imagine that problem is only getting worse. The second aspect of Kopi Luwak production to scale up with demand was caged civet coffee production. Essentially people would capture wild civets, cage them, and force feed them coffee, kind of battery farming Kopi Luwak. I did read one paper that almost proudly stated that over the course of a season of coffee harvest, a single civet could produce 14 kilos of finished product. Though, I'm pretty sure that someone has found a way to force more coffee cherries into that civet and up the yield from them, which is disgusting. Caged civets suffer in just about every single way. They're living in cramped, dirty cages. They are force-fed diet of just coffee cherries, which is not healthy for them. It's just a life of cruelty and captivity, and it is awful. You'll see almost all Kopi Luwak sold as wild civet coffee, but you'll realize pretty quickly this simply cannot be the case. And actually back in 2013, the BBC did an undercover investigation into one of the wild producers and indeed found caged civet farming at the heart of it. I don't think this is uncommon. The stakes are too high. There's too much incentive. There's too much money to stop this kind of fraud happening. Now, the original story goes that these wild civets would eat only the ripest coffee cherries. And then once they were in the gut, combined with their kind of diverse diet, you had this really unique fermentation going on. There is some science to support this. You know, there are kind of unique chemical markers around Kopi Luwak. For example, Kopi Luwak seems to have a lower protein content at the end of that kind of process. Some would argue that the proteins get involved in a lot of roasting reactions that lead to some more bitter compounds, and this they say is why Kopi Luwak is less bitter. In addition, Kopi Luwak does have less caffeine in it. Though, it's a pretty small reduction. This is not a natural decaf. Now, all of this cruelty, all of this potential of for fraud, all this money, is it really worth it at the end of it? Well, most seasoned coffee tasters who are doing blind tastings of Kopi Luwak, generally report that it doesn't taste very good. My own experience? Well, I was told I was tasting Kopi Luwak, and what I tasted was low acidity. It wasn't unusually low in bitterness. It was kind of earthy and a little bit wild, and it was not particularly delicious, and it kind of reminded me of a number of other low-quality coffees that I've had that have had similar attributes. Of course, I cannot be 100% certain that what I tasted was actually Kopi Luwak despite the assurances of everyone around me. So with you knowing now what I know about Kopi Luwak, I have hope it makes sense that I would say, please don't drink this coffee. Please don't fund an unnecessary and cruel aspect of the coffee industry. If you've got money to spend and you wanna kind of blow someone's mind, there are some really weird and wonderful fermentations that are done in a safe way that are way more traceable, that are just way more interesting, and ultimately enjoyable. Go and pick up an experimental fermentation from one of a host of different roasters who have that amongst their offerings. Now, I have a terrible feeling that someone watching this is gonna think, \"Ooh, an issue with transparency. That's a problem that the blockchain could solve.\" No, no, you can still submit false, fraudulent information to the blockchain. And all you're doing is writing with a very permanent, very wasteful marker into the ledger. In fact, I'd argue that it would probably enable fraud by giving a kind of veneer of authenticity to a fraudulent product. So please, no blockchain. If at the end of all of this you are still desperate to try a gastric fermentation and you want absolute traceability and transparency, then you can take inspiration from a gentleman from Portland, Oregon. You know, green coffee is pretty widely available. You can pick it up pretty cheaply. And if you can manage to get it down without chewing, then it'll probably survive intact through your own processing. And you'd have to kind of harvest it, and wash it, and clean it, and roast it, and brew it, but if that disgusts you, why are you even interested in Kopi Luwak in the first place? To be clear, I'm actually not recommending you eat green coffee. Please don't eat green coffee. I'm just saying someone did that. It's an option. But really, just don't. I'm gonna wrap it up there. That is my take on Kopi Luwak.", "videoID": "pkbuFwHnJQY"}, {"title": "Aldi's Absurdly Cheap Single Cup Brewer", "text": "Aldi have a new, super cheap coffee machine type thing. And we're gonna look at it today because this thing, this is a little filter brewing thing that comes with a little stainless steel-ish travel cup. This whole thing is 16 pounds and 99 pence, That, that's - that's barely more expensive than a bag of good coffee, and for a brewer and travel cup, how bad can it be? I can't get into an Aldi product thing without talking about the previous video I made about an Aldi product, which went down controversially. They made a very expensive bean to cup thing that was seemingly cheap, but I thought it was really terrible value for money because it performed quite poorly for the money that you spent. That didn't come across very well. I think people thought I was being very anti Aldi. I have no beef with Aldi. Well, that's a lie. They made an espresso martini flavored cheese. I'm not sure that's forgivable, but I didn't eat it, I just know it exists and that freaks me out, and the coffee-infused bacon, whatever. I feel like they're trolling me sometimes, but they made this and a few people alerted me to it. I grabbed one of the last ones available online and for \u00a316.99, I'm really kind of curious. It would have to be awful to be not worth the money. Just a quick overview of the whole brewer. This is like a little mini home batch brewer. And I suspect the technology inside it, if we opened it up would be pretty much identical. You've got a water reservoir at the back. You're gonna put your water in. It does have a nice little feature to show you how much to fill. They've done a kind of cool stepped thing to show you where the sort of fill lines are, that's nice. It comes with a reusable sort of, I think probably nylon-style brew basket, shower head, obviously. And then underneath, you've got your travel cup. Now it looks fancy stainless steel, but inside is of course, plastic because this whole thing is \u00a316.99 I'll probably keep saying that a lot. Now see down here, there is a little display and you've got an on off button that's starts or stops your brew cycle, useful. You've got hours and minutes to set your clock and then you've got pro. Now, initially I was like, this is pro for professional. The answer is no, it's pro for program, but it means that you can program this to come on in the morning and brew for you at a certain time. I did a big review of a bunch of different, good home coffee brewers, and some of them didn't have this feature. This thing, \u00a317, has this feature. There's no excuse. Please just build this in. I think it's useful. It clearly can be done cheaply and easily. So points to the Aldi brewer from the get-go. But what we need to do really right now is brew some coffee with it and find out, can it brew good coffee? Brew. You get some very dramatic steam coming out of here. It's kind of nice, it's a little bit... spooky. Now we are gonna make a bit of a mess now. You've got your reasonable mesh bed. It hasn't made a terrible mess of this. You know, I don't think it looks too, too bad. It doesn't look great, if I'm honest. Let's give it a taste. I'm gonna decant it though, 'cause I don't wanna drink out of this 'cause it'd just be too hot. It's okay, it's okay. Now in the past, I did make a video about the problems with cheaper coffee brewers and how you can mitigate some of those problems. I'm not doing that stuff today because I just wanna see out of the box, what you get for your 17 English pounds plus shipping. So I'm kinda curious how this thing is performing on a kind of technical level. I'm gonna brew again without coffee in there 'cause I don't actually need coffee for this particular test. And I'm gonna put a couple of temperature probes into this little shower screen here, right? And they're gonna be connected to my computer and we can data log second-by-second, the temperature of the liquid as it's coming out into the shower head. I would expect it to start on the lower end of things and get hotter and hotter and hotter. That's how these brewers typically work. That may not be the case, but that's what I would expect anyway. Oh, and it will have a bit of an advantage having recently been used. So you know, the start might be hotter than it would be if you hadn't used it for a day or so, because the whole system is that bit hotter. So the probes are coming out of here, they're in the shower screen now. They're going into this data logger that talks to my laptop, and we're gonna just log what happens as I push go. I put two in today because when I was testing batch brewers, if I used just one, it was possible to get a kind of weird reading sometimes. So let's see what's going on. That was, not necessarily a surprise. It did exactly kind of what I thought it was going to do. It definitely didn't hit super high temperatures super early, which I think is notable. Are you done, are you finished? So that was super interesting. It kind of went as expected. The temperature climbed through the brew. It was kind of the, started off in the sort of high 80s and then it spend a long time in the mid 90s, which I'm not actually that against, but it crept right up towards pretty close to boiling point at the end. And you see this interesting flat line right at the finish when actually there's no more water coming through with just steam in the system. So I'm not gonna say this thing passed with flying colors. It did okay, it did kind of as expected. It didn't perform in a weird way or a disappointing way. I'm okay with how this performs. It certainly didn't perform worse than something three or four times it's price. I guess the question is, should you buy something like this? Or should you spend the same money on a super cheap setup, which will give you better results? So that's what we're gonna do next. I'm gonna pit this thing against me with a really cheap setup. So in this corner, we have the Ambiano, the cheap \u00a317 Aldi filter coffee machine with stainless steel-styled takeaway cup travel cup. In this corner, something a little bit cheaper. I've got a \u00a35, one cup Hario brewer, a little V60. And I found the cheapest comparable one of these I could on the internet. This cost \u00a36.72. So I'm in for like \u00a311.72 or a little cheaper on this side, which I'm gonna use as an excuse to not cheat, but you know, not make it very silly. I'm gonna be using a kettle with these, but not pouring kettle because that's an additional expense just for coffee making. So I'm gonna use a regular kettle. I'm gonna pour kind of my V60 technique with the normal kettle. It's totally doable, but that's what's gonna happen. I am gonna use a scale 'cause I used a scale to weigh the grounds going to this brewer. And I'll use the scale to weigh the grounds going through this brewer. I'm also gonna weigh the water going into the V60. You can argue about that if you want to, but I feel good about it. So that's just the way it's gonna go down. One more twist. I felt it was gonna be very easy in a blind tasting to pick apart this one, because it has a mesh filter. It'll let through a lot more sediment pieces, a little bit more oil. It'll texturally be quite a different brew, and that's not a bad thing, it's just not good for a head to head test. So I won't be using this. I'm gonna put a paper filter in here. Let me get my box of filters. We keep a reasonable supply here at the studio. I'm gonna use, I'm gonna use, I think like a, like a Kalita starter filter. I think it's gonna just about fit. Should, ooh it pops in very nicely. To make this a fairer game, I'm not even gonna rinse my V60 paper, 'cause I'm not rinsing this paper either. I'll start this brewing, and while it's brewing, I will begin to brew with my V60. Interesting, that's a pretty comparable brew time for both of them. I'm not gonna worry too much about how it could have dialed the grind in. Same water, same grounds, same coffee, same kind of contact time actually. It's really down to is the machine doing a better job than me? Let's find out. It will be the traditional triangle test we like on this channel. I'm gonna step out of the space. Three bowls will appear on the table when I get back. One of them will be odd. I must find it and decide if it's better or worse than the other two. Can I tell the odd one out. As is tradition, there will be one slurp. So my feeling having had a little taste backwards and forwards is that this one is the odd one out. I'm gonna say it's the odd one out, I'm gonna say, I think it's this as well. That's my guess. Let's have a look. Thankfully I appear to be correct, which is a great relief. The reason I would say it tasted different to the other two was primarily in the finish. actually. It was difficult to taste when they were quite hot but as it cooled down, it tasted a little harsher in the finish, which to me speaks to that higher brew temperature toward the end of the brew just pulled out some stuff that wasn't quite as clean and sweet. This brew was a little sweeter. Interestingly, I think it could have gone a little finer if I was dialing these in all over again. I don't think I'd changed the grind on this, but I would on this one, I'd go a little bit finer for the V60. Let's not worry about how and why. I don't think this is a poor showing. Do you know what I mean? I feel that you want me to give you some sort of like percentage improvement and I would say, this is, this setup, this cheap, cheap setup with a simple kettle, all of those things bumps your quality, 20, 25%. That's a good amount of increase. So that is a better, tastier cup, no question. It's not an enormous difference though, right? Like I'm gonna regret saying the number because it's a ridiculous thing to say, but I think this doesn't do a terrible job. You can do a better job with an almost cheaper set up as long as you've got a good grinder, good water, a basically okay technique. Then you can get better coffee than you can do from one of these things. I've gotta be honest. I do have significant concerns about the longevity of this thing. At that price, you are buying the cheapest possible components. This thing is not gonna last a lifetime. It absolutely isn't. And I don't like the idea of buying disposable things. I don't like disposable clothes, I don't like disposable kitchen equipment, especially electrical goods. That's a really bad thing. So I have a concern about that. I can't say this will fail after a year. This will fail after two years. It's not really possible to do, but you just have to look at the price and think, did they put the hardest wearing components in this? Probably not. As always thanks to my Patreon, I could buy this and I'll give it away to one of them. And I'll sweeten the deal. I'll throw in the V60 and the extra travel cup too and maybe some coffee or something just to make it a more enjoyable, little win for them. I appreciate the support in letting me do this sort of stuff.", "videoID": "Xg5ZabSh2P8"}, {"title": "Ultrasonic Rapid Barrel-Aging Coffee - Weird Coffee Science", "text": "MMM! You'll like it! We create a wave by disturbing the surface of the water. I'm still hearing that click from the speaker Oh, it's bursting with ultrasonic. Hi, welcome to today's episode of Weird Coffee Science. The sort of intermittent show where I dress like a grownup and pretend to know what I'm doing. Today it starts with Kickstarter, I suppose. I was sent a link to an ultrasonic cold brew coffee maker that people are trying to get funded. And I shared that link with my Patreon and I said would you be interested in me backing this? Do you want to see a review of this? Is this interesting to you? And broadly they said, yes but several people sent me emails separately. And the common theme of those was that you can just buy a cheap ultrasonic bath. Like this one, this is a jewelry cleaner but it is a heated ultrasonic bath. And they said, you could do it yourself. You could do that whole thing for cheap. Someone else sent me a link to a video on ultrasonic barrel-aging. And so I thought, yeah, let's do that. Let's look at ultrasonic coffee brewing and ultrasonic rapid barrel-aging of coffee. That seems perfectly sensible. First thing I want to do is have a quick look at the impact of ultrasonics on an infusion brew. So here's the test. I'm going to make two kinds of French presses. I'm going to brew 15 grams to 200 grams, 75 grams per liter kind of ratio. I'm going to grind and steep for four minutes before breaking and cleaning and doing all that good stuff. One, we'll sit in an ultrasonic bath with the ultrasonics running for the entire brew. And the next one will sit in the heated ultrasonic bath without the ultrasonics brewing, as our kind of control. Because these things are heated or can be heated, at least, I wanted to see what the actual impact of the ultrasonics is outside of the impact of additional heating on extraction. We'll just filter those out through paper and then have a little look a little taste and see what's changed. So we'll put this into the bath now and I will turn it on. So we're all done. And interestingly the crust is still there still fully formed, though as I lifted up now, it is starting to fall. We'll give it the traditional break and clean. What I'll do now is I'll just strain it through a V 60 filter. Now, just looking at this is really interesting. This is a very, very cloudy cup of coffee right now. Much cloudier than I would have expected, especially post filtration which suggests that anything that suspended in there for whatever reason is so fine that it's made it through a paper filter. That's really, that's really interesting. It's really taking a long time to draw down as well. Now I was curious if there would be any obvious agitation of the grounds. If there had been that crust would have been knocked down much earlier on in the brew. The crust survived pretty much intact on that French press for the entire four minutes that was in the bath. But while this is draining, let's go on with the second, the control, where it goes in the same bath at the same temperature, but, but no ultrasonic waves. I think we're done there. Looks much less cloudy and it's draining through, just looking at, it way quicker. And that liquid is so much clearer. Now I got so impatient with the ultrasonic brew draining that I actually grabbed an arrow press, put a couple of paper filters in there to make sure that they did a good job of filtering and I pressed the last bit through because it was just taking so long to drain. The resulting brew is incredibly muddy and cloudy which is going to present a bit of a challenge for what I want to do next. When this has finished draining, before I taste them I'm going to have a little look with my refractometer to see if there's much difference in the strength of the two brews. The challenge here is that suspended material will give me a funny reading on a refractometer. You need clarified liquid because really refractometers are checking the speed of light passing through coffee. What you want is a kind of clear path. So it's only the dissolved stuff in the coffee, stuff that you're measuring, that is interfering with lights passage through coffee, changing the refractive index. That may not be the case here, but I'll have a look. See what kind of results we get and then of course I'll taste it. Because that's kind of the point of these things. I'm too curious. I'm going to taste first. I'm going to taste first. It shouldn't interrupt or change too much. Let's start with the ultrasonic brew. Sorry for the slurps. Interesting. Very full, tons of texture. Let's try this one. Interesting. Obviously much cleaner tasting. A little crisper in that regards. I don't know if we're going to get good data out of this, to be honest, but we'll try. Let's get a little tiny droplet of our control on first. Interesting. And let's try it a little droplet of our very cloudy other brew. Now this shows a much higher reading. But you could argue that's because the suspended material in this brew is changing the refractive index and giving us a false reading. I don't know if the taste corresponds to the notable jump that this is suggesting. So in this case, I don't think this is a great measure. I have tried filtering this a couple more times and whatever paper filters I have here in the studio can't really clarify this adequately, which is interesting. From a taste perspective, I would say there is a difference. There is a jump in extraction. Now, a lot of people are pitching this kind of technology not for hot coffee, but for cold brewing of coffee to increase your extraction in an environment where you don't have heat energy from hot water to do that extraction work. I would say that there is probably some credibility to that idea. I don't think that's going to be a huge impact unless you know, your sound waves are creating some sort of agitation alongside it. This doesn't create much agitation if any, at all with the ultrasonic sound waves. So it's an interesting idea for cold brew. I'm not going to talk about cold brew today. I will at some point probably, maybe, I don't know. But, there's maybe something here. There's maybe something interesting in increasing your extraction using ultrasonics alongside using the hot water, jacketing the brew during the extraction too. But this isn't where we want it to end today. No, no, no. This is, this is stage one. There is a part two to this. But first there's two things to talk about. Number one, there's a coffee giveaway.

That's maybe why you clicked the thumbnail in the first place. Now barrel-aging is an interesting thing. A while ago, I got to spend some time in some whiskey distilleries talking to distillers and food scientists, and they categorized the impact of barrel aging as having sort of three groups of reactions on the thing that you're aging. Now, in this case, they were talking about whiskey and whiskey was then aged in these oak barrels typically that have been charred on the inside. So group one, they called additive. Which is flavors from the wood leech into the spirit. And those are the most obvious ones, I think. That kind of oakiness, the woodiness that you get in barrel-aged things. And then you have the subtractive. Now, when you char the inside of a barrel you create carbon. And that carbon is active carbon I guess, similar to the active carbon found in most water filters that mop up negative tastes. So having that carbon inside there does take away some unpleasant flavors typically which is also interesting. And then you had a third category that was kind of transformative where there was interactions to create new compounds. It wasn't just existing compounds from the wood leaching into the liquid. They were working together to create something new in terms of flavor. And in some cases, oxygen may be playing a role as well. We're not going to get all of those three groups in this particular experiment. And the reason is that I went out and I bought some Oak chips for flavoring stuff. This little bag here is full of just wood chipped, Oak barrel. It's been toasted. It has had some heat applied to it but there's no active carbon here. There's no burn to bits. So we won't get any subtractive reactions. We will get some additive stuff and we will get some transformative stuff potentially I guess, but that's likely what's going to happen here. Now, these little American Oak chips suggested that they needed to be soaked in hot water for 15 minutes before using and you've maybe noticed them over here the entire time. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to brew just like a V 60 and I'll brew a little bit over half a liter of coffee. We'll then divide that into three separate experiments. One will be a pure control where it will just be left on the side here. Ambient temperatures just to see what kind of infusion happens that way. One will be heated in the bath and infused that way. And another will be heated in the bath alongside the ultrasonics running to see exactly what kind of an impact each of those things is having. Can we add flavor? Is it good? Is it recommended? I've strained my Oak chips, they are now ready. I have half a liter of coffee ready to go and we'll be doing a four minute infusion to match brew times for reasons we'll come back to at the end I'm going to use a about 1% weight of these damp chips which means about a gram and a half of these things which is not very much to 150 mils of coffee. What I will say as they start to infuse is that these are incredibly aromatic. And in many cases I'm not a huge fan of Oak flavor. In wines, this is just a personal thing, I don't really like very heavily oaked wines because it doesn't really taste of the grapes or where they're from. It just tastes of oak. It's rarely used with a delicate touch in a lot of wine making, but a lot of people like that kind of quality, it's just not me. These smell pretty great. And I could understand how these aromas could work pretty well with coffee. So I'll be interested to see how they combine, how they work together. But that is one of the reasons that I'm using only a one and a half grams to 150 mils. I did look at another YouTube video where they were doing this with spirits, cream, apple cider, a bunch of different stuff. They were using a much, much, much higher dose and had some pretty transformative results. But I think they really liked the results cause they really liked the flavors of oak and that's okay. I just don't like it as much. I want to see if you can use it in a more subtle, delicate way where it's a sort of piece of the puzzle not an overriding flavor across the whole thing. Got my three cupping bowls ready so I can start to strain. So ambient control our heated control And into the bath that goes on, goes the ultrasonics. So the last one is done and I will add one more control of just the coffee itself without any Oak to see how that is. So let's taste, let's start with nothing tastes like a nice cup of coffee. Good. Let's start with some oak chips just left a hangout, ambient temperature, very subtle very little flavor there from the oak. There, but it's not particularly strong. Well, that's interesting having a sort of warmer jacket around the brew really made no difference to the extraction there. Ultrasonic. Yeah, much stronger. It's there almost in the finish. It's this kind of warming, quite pleasant addition. I would say, if you wanted to do this you could probably wrap it all up into one single moment. I would go very slightly heavier on the Oak chips if you like that. But there is a pleasant addition, even at a 1% ratio. You could therefore put your ground coffee in with some Oak chips and some hot water, and then brew it in an ultrasonic bath and end up with kind of an interesting zero to barrel-aged coffee experience in four minutes. And that's kind of cool. Now these things, while this is cheap-ish. They're not cheap cheap. I'm not going to leave links to this cause I'm not, you know, hugely in love with this particular bath but any cheap jewelry cleaning one will work similarly, I presume. Anything that basically does ultrasonics will work. It's an interesting way to get barrel-aging without having to use a long time and our likely exposure to oxygen which would create a lot of oxidized kind of flavors that are just less delicious to me anyway. So you can have your cake and eat it. You can have those heavier richer kind of whiskey like qualities in your coffee if you want to but you will begin to mask where the coffee is from, its variety, its process, all that kind of stuff. So it's one that has an ethical, aesthetic, kind of quandary to it, whether it's good or bad to do but it is still interesting to see how quickly you can get you know, extraction of flavor using ultrasonics. What did I miss? What didn't I try? What do you want me to see me do with this potentially? Maybe I'll post some extra videos to Instagram or somewhere.

You doubted me, you thought I'd given up on the clear coffee drinks. You thought that because now I was doing other things there will be no more clear coffee drinks, but look, look what I've got. Now, this is from Rolling River, I believe in Oregon, and this is not available anywhere. I think it's like a locally available thing that is hard to get. So thank you to Eric for dragging this across the ocean and giving me this bottle. This is very much appreciated. So this is a coffee flavored grain spirit, I guess. And clearly, 'cause it's clear, they've put the coffee in before a final distillation process. I'm intrigued by this. The coffee is roasted by Coava, that makes me feel positive. I've heard good things about it so far. Maybe we're gonna have a good day. Maybe we're gonna have a good day. Maybe I'll drink it myself. Let's get it open. I'm nervous 'cause I think this is gonna be good, but if it's not, I'll feel bad. This is supposed to be good, whether it's cold or not. Now I instinctively would make these things cold, but I was told no need, it's good times. So straight into the glass we go. Let's have a little smell. Let's have a little smell. Not bad, quite boozy, like quite spirit-like as a smell, not a ton of coffee in there so far. That is... Now, that is pretty good. That is quite a delicate usage of coffee. It's quite clever, I'll give it points for that. It's not sledgehammer coffee flavor that causes pain to the face. This is soft, warm, sweet coffee flavor. It's quite a nice selection, I guess, of coffees flavors in there. I mean, it's quite hard to taste something that's 40% alcohol. It's okay. It's interesting 'cause it kind of comes and goes, it moves in and out. There's this moment where you're just hit by alcohol and you know, this sort of soft, sweet coffee appears, then it runs away again. And then it pops up a little bit later on and it sort of hangs out for a minute and then it's gone. I would say that this is interesting because I think it'd be quite an easy coffee spirit to mix with because the coffee's not that strong, you get these sort of warm undertones of coffee flavor but you wouldn't have those big, big, big, you know, like ugly coffee flavors that so many people seem to think that people like. No one likes those. No one likes those. This is good. My criticism would be, and there's gonna be criticism, there must always be criticism, that it's a little nice. It's a little nice. It's a little soft and sweet and friendly. It could be a bit more, interesting? That's harsh. But it's friendly. It's friendly. This is easily the best clear coffee drink I've ever drunk. That was a low bar, but it is what it is. Like it's not bad, I'd be intrigued to mix with this. So there you go, Rolling River. Well done. I don't know if I'm disappointed or happy that I had quite a nice time. I'll give this a little go. Now I'll take this home. I'll maybe mix a few cocktails with it, see what comes of it, see if I change my mind in any meaningful way. But I would say if you like coffee booze, then if you see this, it's maybe worth picking up a bottle. It's all right. It's all right.", "videoID": "mPoturQr92Q"}, {"title": "The Ultimate French Press Technique", "text": "This is how to get incredible results with a French press. We're looking for a really delicious cup of coffee with none of the silty-sludgy stuff at the bottom. If you're in a hurry this really isn't gonna work for you. This is a really great way to make coffee but it's not very quick. You need a little bit of patience that will be rewarded. You need to get some delicious coffee. Delicious means fresh, like freshly roasted, and you're gonna grind it fresh if you want the best possible experience. This will work with pre-ground coffee but it won't taste as good as it could, so grind fresh. I would recommend starting between 60 and 70 grams per liter. How you like it, is up to you. Get some digital weighing scales. This is gonna seem insane but I promise you, it's incredibly useful. There are two reasons to use it. You brew coffee that tastes really good, you wanna do that every single time you brew it, and, therefore, knowing what you did is the way to get there. The alternative is that you brewed a bad cup of coffee. Now you know what you're changing when you try something different the next time, and it will make life so much easier. Fresh, clean, soft water. Don't brew with hard water, don't brew with unfiltered water. If it doesn't taste delicious on its own, it's not gonna make great tasting coffee. So, here's how this is gonna work. When you grind your coffee, put it in the French press. Ignore what most people say, don't grind super coarse. Grind something more likely described as medium. Boil your water. Don't worry too much about this, as long as it's boiled, and then pour the right amount of water on top. I might brew 30 grams of coffee to 500 grams of water. And then, we're gonna let it sit for four minutes. just hang out, wait, be patient. We're gonna grab a couple of tablespoons. With one of them, we're gonna stir the crust that forms on top of the coffee. a lot of it will start to fall away, and then you'll be left with some bits on top. Some foam, some floating bits. You wanna scoop those off, just throw them down the sink, it's fine. Now, here's the bit that seems difficult. I want you to do nothing at all for at least five minutes. Now this is a little frustrating 'cause you feel like you've brewed the coffee, but even if you pour it into a cup, it's too hot to drink right now anyway, and the longer you leave it, the better it's gonna taste. As you sit, all of those floating bits start to fall down to the bottom of the press, and settle in that bed of coffee. This is exactly what we want. We don't want those in the cup, we want those stuck down at the bottom of the cafetiere. After five, maybe seven, eight minutes, now you can drink it. When you put the plunger in, do not plunge all the way. All you're gonna do there is stir up all the sediment, all over again.", "videoID": "st571DYYTR8"}, {"title": "The xBloom Review\uff1a Is Great Filter Coffee Easy Now\uff1f", "text": "Today we're gonna review this. It's the xBloom coffee brewer, something new and unusual because it's both a bean-to-cup filter coffee machine, but also a pod machine, which is something you don't see every day. It's a little bit unusual in its design. The whole idea behind this is to kind of make a promise. Is to say, you, you there, do you love delicious filter coffee? Do you find the process of brewing it annoying and kind of irksome? Do you find the whole idea of dialing in a recipe eye rollingly irritating rather than kind of fun? If that's you, this is who they're trying to reach. They're saying this machine's gonna take all the pain away, make life easy, and make you kind of perfect, well-brewed filter coffee each and every time. How will it do that? That's the question. And ultimately, will it do that? Will it deliver on its promise? That's what we're here to discuss. To explain how this whole thing works, we should really start with the pods, which are these. Now, this is quite a large pod, and inside of here will be maybe 15 to 16 grams of coffee, depending on which roaster has put coffee inside this thing. Now, when you peel open the pod. Very satisfying sound. You'll find inside coffee beans. And those coffee beans are sitting inside a very neatly folded coffee filter paper, because this pod is not just for storing the coffee, this pod is a brewing cone and brewing filter paper, all in one. Now the magic of this happens when you touch the pod  to the top of the machine, because at the base of this pod is an RFID chip that has just told the coffee machine what the coffee is, and it's communicated a recipe to it as well. On the front of the machine you can see a kind of visual representation of that. It's showing you firstly grind size, so how finely or how coarsely it should grind the coffee. Then the brew temperature, how hot the water should be. And finally the kind of ratio of coffee to water. At this point, we pour the beans in. We put this thing in the little tray, the little holder. Make sure it's level. That is important. And then if we push go, it's gonna grind coffee and start to brew. Now as it's brewing, you can hear it's pretty loud. You can hear both the little gurgling of the water heater going on, but you can also hear quite a loud little PC fan, that's sitting inside the body here, keeping anything steamy away from the precious electronics. And then you can hear that. A little jiggle, a little agitation of the grounds at the end of the bloom phase, something actually I'm kind of into generally. I like a little swirl of a V60, sometimes a stir, if that suits you better. Here it's doing a little side-to-side jiggle. At this point, after a period of bloom, it will begin to pour the water. And how it pours the water is another way that it's being unusual, clever, and a little bit interesting. As you watch this brew, you can see that the stream of water is moving around on the coffee bed and it's doing that in a very clever way. There's no mechanical piece here, nothing's rotating. Instead, right at the exit of the spout are four I suppose, conductors, and by passing a charge through them you'll have a kind of electrostatic pull on the water. So as you sort of vary the charge around the conductors, you can vary the pull on the water that sort of changes its direction. And without doing anything mechanical, you can move a stream of water around. Now because the fan is genuinely pretty noisy, I'm just gonna wait until it stops brewing to talk to you about the coffee that it brews and some more about this particular pod. So the the brew is now done and it seems important to point out that there's one big difference between this and other pod machines that make filter coffee that you might have seen. And that's speed. This brews in a similar way to someone who's brewing a pour over, which means that the brew process takes minutes, not seconds. If you've used things like K-Cups, or Nespresso Vertuo pods, or other kind of pod systems, they tend to prioritize very rapid brewing. Now, there's no real noticeable warmup time here Once you turn it on, and put a pod in and start brewing, it goes pretty much straight away. So it's quick, but the brewing process is relatively slow. This brew is obviously a little bit too hot for me to taste properly right now, but it is a good opportunity to talk about the pod. Now this will probably drip on the table, but nevermind. This pod. Now, the pod itself merits some discussion. Most people are very anti-pod machines because they see pods as contributing to waste, be it an aluminum pod, be it a different kind of pod. People are generally anti-pod from a waste perspective. xBloom's approach has been to make this thing fully compostable, which is broadly good, with the exception, of course, of the RFID chip at the bottom. So if I was gonna compost this, I would need to from the bottom here, remove this little RFID chip. That would obviously need to be disposed of separately to the rest of this pod. Now a quick note on composting, it doesn't feel as neat and clean and simple as I wish it was. And that's not an indictment on compostable things. That's an indictment on composting services where most people live. Where this studio is, for example, if I put this into my food waste to be composted, it along with any other packaging will be removed because they can't tell what's compostable and what's not. So it all gets taken out. If I can try and put it into my garden waste, again, destined for compost, that will also have any packaging removed and taken out. So for me here, the best thing to do would be to put the ground coffee into my food waste. But this pod, regardless if it's biodegradability, is going to end up in landfill in many parts of the world. As I said, I'm not criticizing them for that decision. I just think it's important to talk about, you know, compostable stuff and how it actually figures into our lives and our waste disposal systems. And I wish composting was kind of better. The RFID chip is, it's a point of conflict for me. I understand that they're chasing convenience for the end user. And actually this is a very convenient technology. It's a very quick and neat way to communicate enough information to have a recipe be transferred over or information about the coffee be transferred over. I think about what the alternatives could be. It would either be something like image recognition where either you're gonna take a photo of the pod with your phone, or this would have a camera, but I really don't want cameras in smart devices in my kitchen. Or you could do something like the Nespresso Vertuo system that uses a barcode in the brew chamber and it scans that. But this doesn't really feel like a place where I want a barcode scanner hanging out. So I struggle with it. I understand why they've made the choice. I just feel like this has to be excess cost and excess waste in a system, and I would hope for a better solution in the future than this. This definitely makes me feel a little uncomfortable despite how well it works and how seamless it makes the whole process. Ultimately, I think it will be one of the biggest points of pushback from the broader coffee community to this machine and this particular system. Now, this tasting glass that I will drink from soon, once this is cooled, just a little bit more, did come with the coffee machine. It was included in the kind of Kickstarter package. In addition to that, I got 32 of the pods from four different roasters. That was good. Most of those are now gone. I've drunk a lot of them. I also got this, which was quite nice, is a little a sort of solution to a problem. This is some Third Wave Water. I've got five sachets there that would make up five gallons. This is minerals that you would add to distilled water in order to have the right minerality for brewing delicious coffee. Because it's one of the variables that has this massive impact on cup quality, on how delicious the coffee is, that's actually really hard to control. So they're trying to set people up for success from the beginning, which I appreciate. And the one other thing that came with it, which we'll have to talk about a little bit more 'cause it needs a bit more discussion, is this, which is designed to be a kind of reusable pod to allow you to use any coffee that you want to use. That I think is a good thing. They're obviously, you know, sensitive to the idea that people don't want to feel locked into a system. You know, it's one of the criticisms of pod systems is that you can only buy the coffee in the pods. You can't brew the coffee that you wanna brew. They've said, no, no, no. If you put in let's say a Kalita 155 paper filter, you can, you know, tap this on top, build out a recipe, and you can brew whatever coffee you want to brew. And to explain that a little bit more, I should probably show you the app that comes with this. Because I do like the fact that I don't have to use an app to make a coffee. I don't get have to get my phone outta my pocket in the morning. I don't have to suffer dealing with technology. I can go beep, pour, brew, and have coffee. That seems kind. But the app lets you do quite a lot. If this brew wasn't to my liking, I could make a change to it, or I can build a recipe for a coffee that xBloom don't know about. So I'm in the app and at the start of it you can sort of browse some of the roasters that they're working with. I will say they're working with a selection of great roasters who buy and roast great coffee, which is good. I'm pro that. At the top you can see the machine, I can tap into the machine. Now to explain things, if I put a pod on top,  you'll see that it detects the pod and I can actually tap into that. Now in a situation where I may wanna tweak a pod's recipe, well, I can do that very easily. The first page is quick edit. And you'll see if I tap that, then I can just move these sliders around. Obviously, the smaller the number on the grind size, the finer the grind. Let me come out of there though and show you get creative, which I suppose if you're building out a recipe on your own, you might wanna look at this. Here you can see a little bit more information. And as you watched that pod before, you see it did sort of multiple pours rather than one continuous pour. And you can edit each of those continuous pours. So here there's quite a lot of little pours in this particular recipe. I can sort of swipe across and see them. And I can change the volume of each pour, it's brew temperature. I can change the pattern with which the spout dispenses water. I can do a little vibration before or after. And it can also change my beverage size and my grind size at the top. Let's just say I wanna take that, oh, just a touch finer. There we go. Now when I save that, I can save that as a brand new profile, which is interesting. Now, if I wanted to, I could even turn this profile into the default for this particular pod, which means that whenever I use that pod without getting my phone out, it would use my profile, and not the one that's kind of baked into it, which is nice if you feel like you know more than the machine or you want it to brew differently than how it wants to brew. And this is something I've definitely thought quite a lot about, but I'll tell you about that in a little bit. Overall, I think a well-built app, pretty easy to use. That's kind of all good. I'm not really gonna complain about that at all. We're not done talking about this though. We'll come back to this. But I do need to now taste some coffee and talk about how that has been. That is a pretty well-brewed cup of coffee. I would say it's not a particularly flawed cup of coffee, but at the same time I would say that it is not reaching the absolute full potential of the coffee. And I think there's a couple of different reasons for that. One of those is kind of wrapped up in a philosophical discussion. Let me take you back to my first experiences with this machine. When we got it out of the box and we started brewing with it, the coffee it produced was extremely disappointing. It was extremely under extracted. If you know a little bit about extraction science, that'll make sense. Basically, when you grind coffee, about 30% of it is soluble, but you don't want all 30%. Typically, people are looking for somewhere between 20 and 23% of the coffee to be extracted into the cup below. If you get less than that, the brew is not only weak, but not really balanced and sweet. And that's what we were getting. We were getting kind of 17% extractions, weak under extracted brews. The grind was too coarse. At that point you're like, wait, wait, wait. The whole promise of this machine is that you just put the pod on top, pour the coffee in, it takes care of everything. How could this be wrong? And the issue was ultimately one of a grind calibration. Now having spoken to xBloom, they're very confident in how they calibrate these at factory. But I definitely had an issue with this machine that was relatively easy to resolve. Inside the app there's a setting to go to for the grinder. And you can run an auto calibrate function to kinda recalibrate everything. And that has definitely improved the coffee that this thing is brewing. Now extractions are more like 19, 19.5%. That's the kind of range where, I don't know if I am struggling with the roaster's interpretation of the coffee, or the machine's delivery of the roaster's brew method, right? Like, the roaster chose the grind setting, the roaster chose the brew temperature, and the ratio, and the pours, and all of that stuff. Were they aiming for 19.5% in the cup or is my grind still a fraction coarse? I don't know. I don't know the answer to that. It's not a bad cup, but I know it could be a better cup, and that leaves me a little bit kind of confused and conflicted. It could be, it's doing exactly what the roaster wanted and they prefer that kind of lighter extraction, that not kind of, they don't wanna get into the 20s, they don't wanna go higher. They prefer this. And that's not wrong. If that's what they like, that's what they like. There's no right and wrong in coffee. It is kind of annoying. I wish there was a right and wrong. I wish there was a this is doing exactly right or it's not. But it's brewing pretty good coffee. But I, if I had this, I would definitely be in and tweaking the recipes, certainly from a grind size for most of the pods that I've brewed. Not by a lot. I think, originally I would say the original grind setting was out by like six or seven steps on the grinder. Now, I might adjust one or two. So it's definitely improved. But, you know, as an experience that promises maximum ease, I'm not sure that's entirely what I was delivered. These things happen. This is a Kickstarter. I paid $400 for it, not $800, which is the list price. And the nature of backing a Kickstarter says you are getting a discount 'cause you are taking a gamble. And the issue that I had was minor and easily resolved. So I'm not out to sort of damn xBloom for this issue because it's been fixed and the coffee is much better. But it has wrapped me into this weird philosophical conundrum where I don't know how the coffee's supposed to taste, which is kind of weird. Now, there is one other issue I wanna talk about that is not to do with the grinder, but is to do with how it sort of delivers water, and how the kind of pouring thing works. If you get nerdy about pouring water onto coffee, which unfortunately has happened to me, you'll know that if you have a stream of water fall into the kind of coffee brewing liquid, then that's a good thing because the sort of energy of the water falling is translated and it will agitate the bed underneath. If you pour slowly enough that the pour breaks up into droplets, what you see is actually that energy becomes sort of dissipated and as the droplet hits, the energy kind of goes sideways but not down. Like it doesn't seem to churn the coffee underneath the same way. Here, the water breaks before it hits the coffee bed. And so I think it's doing less agitation that I would say is desirable. To double check my theory, I did separately have the machine grind some coffee that I brewed with a pouring kettle. And it's not the most scientific of tests. But in those comparisons I preferred the pouring kettle each and every time. I just preferred that additional level of agitation. It just felt like the coffee was a little sweeter. I got a little bit more out of it. I wish the stream did not break before it hit the bed of the coffee. Let's talk about the price of the pods. You buy them directly from xBloom and they have a couple of different price points. In my money, in the British Sterling, 32 pods cost \u00a339 or \u00a326, which is I think around \u00a31.20 per pod or 80 pence a pod. At 80 pence a pod, you are closer to specialty pod, kind of prices. Even though most specialty pods contain five or six grams of coffee, rather than 15 or 16 grams of coffee. \u00a31.20 that is much more expensive. I'm not saying that coffee should be cheaper, I'm not saying that at all. I'm just saying it is relatively expensive per cup. Now this unit is a 110 volt unit. This is not built for Europe. They have not launched in Europe. They are launching May 25th I think in North America, so US and Canada. 220 volt is coming later. I'm obviously running this on a beefy transformer underneath here to make sure we're all safe and sound. Now you can argue, coming back to this, that you don't have to use their pods. You get the reusable pod with this. But this is suddenly comparable to kind of going back to having a V60, and a grinder, and a pouring kettle yourself. And going back to doing the work of dialing in, of deciding how to pour, and deciding how hot your water should be. You know, you still have to go and build a recipe for this. And so this is kind of interesting to me because it's very nice to have it. It's nice not to have people feel like they're locked in, but actually the lock-in still happens from a workflow and convenience perspective. I don't think people who buy this machine are gonna be using this all that much. Lovely if a friend gives you a bag of coffee to try and play with, and you're like, \"Oh, I can brew that.\" But it'll be a bit of work, a bit of decision-making. I feel like this machine appeals to people who don't want to do the work and the decision-making. So it's a kind of weird one for me. But I think it's a very good thing that they've done it and I'm pro them shipping this. I think that's a good thing. While we're on the topic of good things, I would say that the grinder inside this is a good grinder. It's a conical burr grinder. It does, I think a very good job. I like the cups that it's capable of producing. So from that point of view, you're getting a pretty good grinder inside this. I'm not sure it's at the level of something like the Ode Gen 2, which I think probably makes better tasting coffee, but it's not that far away. Like, it's still making tasty, sweet clean cups. There's not too much mess. There's a little bit of mess around the grinder. This plate here comes off. There'll be a little bit of coffee inside and on the underside. Different coffees seem to have different static quantities. It's a little bit messy, but not horrifically messy by any stretch. If you look under the grinder, you'll see a little kind of paperclip thing. That's doing a little declumping distribution work from the bottom of the grinder. Obviously, the coffee's coming into here and being spread between the four holes to distribute it evenly into the filter paper, into the pod, which is pretty good. It does have these four little mound that you see in the pod, and I wish I could kind of get in there, and shake it level before the brew starts, but that's not really what they want you to do. So I'm not sure I'm gonna recommend you try and do that. But overall, I don't really have much in the way of complaints about the grinder. But I do still have some other complaints, I'm afraid. Firstly, probably the biggest one for me that's kind of confusing, well, it's tied to the dimensions. Now, this machine is very tall and for some people too tall, if you're trying to, you know, operate this underneath some kitchen cabinets, this may be a little bit too high. It is a very tall machine. And they've chosen to go very tall, not very wide, and a little bit deep, but not really very deep. As a result of that, the water tank, oh, is very small. It's very small. It is at its maximum capacity 700 milliliters. That means that you can brew two cups out of this before you need to refill it. Not three, just the two. A typical cup's gonna be around 250 mls, so it's not like a seven 50 ml tank where you might squeeze three cups out. It's two with a bit left over. There are environments where I could see this machine working like an office, but then if you have to refill the water tank every two cups, suddenly I feel like the office would be constantly complaining about the coffee machine that you constantly have to fill up. And if it's, you know, you and someone else at home making coffee in the morning, every day you're filling the tank. If you wanna brew two or three cups a day, you're filling the tank. It just feels like they could have made the machine a little bit deeper, a tiny little bit wider, and given a substantially larger water tank to it that wouldn't have been as frustrating for most people when it comes to the kind of refilling piece of this thing. It just feels slightly anti the whole high convenience, easy experience that the rest of the machine is trying to offer. In terms of other nitpicks, the display on the front, I kind of don't get it, really. When you put a pod on top and you see the recipe come up, that isn't really information I can read. At best, it's just telling me that a recipe has been communicated, but I can't really see, you know, any numbers here. It's just a rough representation. In addition, I feel like a little bit of a lie. At the top of the brew temps here it says 99 degrees Celsius. This thing can run its water heater at 99 Celsius, but it can only produce water at 95 Celsius from the dispense. It just seems a little bit odd to tell me one thing, but actually in the app and other places offer me a different number. And so in conclusion I find myself a little bit impressed and a little bit disappointed by the xBloom, but ultimately kind of hopeful. There are challenges that I hope they can fix and overcome. The RFID chip as one, the sort of breaking up with the stream as another. It's doing a high convenience thing and it's doing a reasonable job. I just wish it was doing a slightly better job on the extraction. I wish the extractions were just a little bit higher so that I was still confident that, that's exactly how the roaster wanted that coffee. And I definitely, definitely, definitely don't have a calibration issue still. I still worry that this grinder is set one or two steps coarser than it should be, despite me running the calibration on it. But I can't know that because I don't know what the roaster was trying to achieve. You get my frustration here, right? Like, you understand that kind of gray area is, to someone like me, maddening. But it's brewing good coffee. And if it gets more people drinking great coffee and buying good coffee from good roasters, that I think is probably a good thing. Not everyone wants to go through the rigmarole of dialing in a grinder doing all that stuff themselves. They like the fact that you can get a grinder, and a kettle, and a robot in between them. The price, list price, which is $800, which they're now selling on their website for, is definitely a challenging price. That's a lot more than a good grinder and a kettle. That, you know, the cost of the convenience, the cost of the robot in between is pretty high. Having paid $400 for it, I feel pretty good about that value. But if I was paying 800, that is to me a tougher sell. But now I want to hear from you. I think they've shipped about 1000 of these, a bit more now.", "videoID": "hM1cP555xt4"}, {"title": "Why Modern Espresso Is So Ugly", "text": "Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking: This is clickbait. It's not. I will explain. And, you might also be thinking: Well, actually, I make beautiful espresso. And I'm sure you do. The short version of this is that espresso now tastes better. But, we should go back. Back to maybe 15 years ago when espresso was very beautiful. Now, the gold standard of espresso, when I go into it, the gold standard of how espresso should look was, without question, David Schomer. Maybe it was just that I was, you know, young and impressionable at that time, but I don't think there's really ever been a more beautiful kind of pour than the sort of stuff David Schomer used to do. The way the espresso sort of fell from the spouts. It was just, it looked so good. The way we made espresso was really, we were trying to use a lot of visual information and so it's not particularly surprising that I look back at it, that we were optimizing what we were doing for the best looking espresso because it was how it looked that informed the decisions we made about whether something was good or bad. Whether it was pouring well or badly. There's kinda three separate things I want to talk about. One, I want to talk about the way espresso falls from the spouts. That's changed. Two, I want to talk about how it kind of looks in the cup. The crema. And we're gonna talk about tiger striping, too. We'll get there. So let's talk about the way that, you know, the coffee pours. How good it looks. 'Cause these days, espresso as it pours does not look as good as it used to. Tastes better but it doesn't look as good. And there's a couple of reasons for this. Ultimately, the recipe, the way that we've brewed, has fundamentally changed. Back in the day, grinding fresh was kind of new and the way that the coffee was dosed was to use the basket. To fill the basket as a way of dosing a consistent amount of coffee. This was way more coffee than people had used in the past. For like that very traditional 14 gram double espresso from Italy, we were suddenly doing kind of 20, 22 gram doses. Along with that, well those didn't taste very good, if you didn't adapt the way you roasted, right? Like, it was really hard to extract 20, 22 grams in a normal basket, so people started to roast darker. Now, let's talk about water for a second. Little tiny bit of science here. Water is a polar substance. Each water molecule has a kind of positively charged end and a negatively charged end. So if you let water hang out, it kinda wants to stick to itself. That's what creates surface tension and it has a property called cohesion. Right, it wants to be attracted to itself. It also has a property called adhesion where it wants to stick to other things because of this kind of magnetic charge. Now there is something you can do that messes with adhesion and cohesion. That messes with water's relationship, its magnetism to itself: And that's dissolve stuff in it. So the more stuff that you dissolve, the more stuff gets between the water molecules and the harder it is for them to stick together. Why is this relevant? A good question. Let's go back to looking at how an espresso brews. So at the start when the espresso brews, that first liquid coming through the puck that is chock-full of soluble material. And as a result, it's not very sticky anymore. So that espresso falls straight down from the spout. As your espresso progresses, you'll notice that it starts to cling a little bit more to the spouts and it starts to sort of arch inwards. And that's really just saying, how strong is the liquid flowing through. Now, the way that we've changed brewing has gone from massive doses in and relatively short doses out. Which meant that almost your entire pour was chock-full of solubles. It still might be under-extracted at the end of it, 'cause you've just got so much coffee to extract but it looked beautiful. And we would often stop, sort of brewing, the moment that it seems to be a little thinner, that it went kind of blonde or whatever we said back then. That was the end point. It was purely visual. Now that we know that actually there's still good stuff coming out of the spouts at that point and typically would bring lower doses again. We had kind of shifted back from like 20, 22 down to like 16 to 18 grams. We were also brewing more liquid in the espresso. So it's getting bigger, therefore, pushing more water through and that water is gonna be weaker, it's gonna have less dissolves stuff in it. It's gonna cling to the spouts more. And I kind of miss how good old espresso used to look, right? Like that old-school massive dose, it just looked so pretty. It looked so good brewing. I think, like in competitions you'd be watching people's pours to see at what point they started to cling to the spouts a little bit more and sort of lose that straight beautiful drop there. And these days, they don't drop straight down for long. Pretty quickly they start to pull inwards and that's just the way that we're brewing has changed. It's changed the nature and the strength of the liquid coming out. So that's why, that's one of the reasons, that espresso is no longer quite as beautiful as it was before. Well, one other subject, I do wanna talk a little bit about crema. Now, I am not the biggest fan of the taste of crema. Like it doesn't, you know you get a spoonful that's not good and taking it off an espresso and drinking that without its crema is an interesting and enjoyable little exercise. So it's important to remember that crema is really just a foam of the liquid below it. It's not different or separate. It's not special. It's just foam, right? And the color of that foam is pretty much related to the color of the beverage down below. Now, as I've said before we're pulling ultimately weaker shots of espresso. Better tasting, better extracted, more balanced, more flavorsome you might argue. Not as textured and rich and decadent but, but delicious. Now that liquid is weaker. And as a result if you make a foam from a paler liquid you'll get a paler foam. And don't forget, the color of coffee itself comes from what are called melanoidins, like brown byproducts of roasting. And the darker you'll roast something, the more of these there'll be. The deeper, the richer the red brown you'll have. You can't get stunningly deep red brown crema from pretty light roasts. It can't be done. You haven't generated enough of those melanoidins and those kind of compounds that give coffee its color. Very dark roasts will produce darker, richer looking crema and then also produce a bit more CO2. They'll age a bit quicker, so they'll degas faster 'cause they're more brittle and that roasting process kind of makes the whole coffee bean more porous and so it does age a little quicker, but fresh it will have more CO2. In addition, if you really want to get into the old-school, if you are still using like a little tickle of robusta which I believe for a long time, for example David Schomer, a little tickle of Robusta in there. Robusta has less oil in the bean naturally than arabica does. About half the amount. And oil is the enemy of foam. If you've made meringues, you will know this to be true. Right, like fat destroys foam for reasons we'll maybe talk about another time. But don't forget, robusta will give you not only more crema but longer lasting crema. More stable crema. Doesn't taste good, I think, most of it. There's better, there's worse this is not the time. And the last thing I wanna touch upon is what we typically call tiger stripes. It's like a beautiful flecking across the top of the crema. It looks very beautiful. You feel like you've made something very beautiful when you make an espresso like this. Now, this whole rant actually came from a trip I took recently to Italy. And I pulled some shots. And one of the shots I've pulled of kind of local coffee there just looked very pretty. And it reminded me that espresso doesn't really look like this day to day anymore. And I felt a little nostalgic. I felt a little sad but it was also, I was like wow maybe that's something to talk about here, in terms of the science of coffee and why things are the way that they are. Now, tiger striping that's essentially just lots of tiny piece of ground coffee trapped in the crema. And as you brew, typically you're espresso pour hits one side of the cup, drags the foam underneath and it kind of pulls the remaining crema across the cup, causing these kind of flecks to spread out as you brew. Again, to kind of brew this way you would need to be grinding quite a brittle coffee, so you get a lot more of these tiny little grinds that come out at the start. You do sometimes see them with lighter roasts and that kind of stuff, but it's relatively rare compared to how it used to be. And those are a few thoughts on why modern espresso doesn't look as good as it used to. I'm not out here, trying to trash-talk what you make, what you enjoy that's not the point. And if you like the old-school style of stuff, that's okay, too. I'm not trying to say that it's worse. I know I said that it tastes better now, but it's maybe more to my tastes, I guess. I'll hold my hands up there. All I'm trying to say is that it's kind of interesting, the way that modern techniques have impacted the look of espresso. And that maybe, you know, it's okay to be a little nostalgic for how things used to look. It was a very satisfying part of being a barista, producing gorgeous-looking shots. You don't taste most of what you make in a day, so if it looks fantastic that does feel kind of good. Anyway, I welcome your thoughts. I don't really know what you're gonna say.", "videoID": "nYFb43tEylk"}, {"title": "The Best Espresso Machine Under \u00a3500", "text": "Welcome.Today, we are looking at five espresso machines under or around 500 pounds. This was a follow-up to a previous video, which was the best espresso machine under 100 pounds. Here we are, 500 pounds and anything between 100 and 500 was on the table. First up, we have the Lelit Anna that was 350 pounds, we have the DeLonghi Dedica, 189 pounds. By far the cheapest in this category, but had a lot of requests to look at this and this seemed like the best opportunity to do so. We've got the Rancilio Silvia, 529 pounds is what I paid, so technically out of budget, but I've seen it for around 500 so it was worthy of inclusion here. We've got the Sage Bambino Plus, that was 399 pounds and at the end here, we've got the Gaggia Classic Pro, also 399 pounds. Important note here, I'm gonna use these as mostly stock. I'm not going to modify them heavily, with one small exception. Where I can I'll be using a better basket. These two machines both came with pressurized portafilters only and it was such an easy thing to switch out that it seemed worthwhile doing and in this case with the Gaggia and the Rancilio, they're both 50 ml portafilters, I'm gonna use a better basket for them too for the espresso testing. That does put the Lelit at a slight disadvantage, because it will be using its stock basket which isn't as good as a VST basket but it's a 57 mm portafilter and I just couldn't find a basket in time that was of a standard that I was looking for. As to how these were chosen, there was really one criteria, which is that they were broadly available in lots of different parts of the world. There were other machines that were proposed, mostly by my patron group, but I picked these because they're kind of the most available and easier to get and therefore giving this the widest utility, I hope, to you, the viewer. So here's how testing is gonna work. Firstly, I'm going to talk through each individual model in terms of its build, construction, how it's kind of felt to use, some of the ergonomics there then the important stuff, we're gonna pull some shots of espresso with each of them and I'll talk through the kind of espresso I was able to get and if one of them maybe pulls better espresso than another. We'll do some simple milk steaming tests, both how quick it is and the kind of quality of milk that the steam ones on these produce. At the end, we'll wrap up, talk through which one of these will suit you the best based on what you want from an espresso machine owning experience. Let's start with the Lelit Anna. Now I'll be honest, going into this Lelit was not a brand I knew particularly well. 350 pounds buys you a pretty solid build. Using this didn't result in the machine sliding around very much. It's got a nice weight to it. The things I like bless about the build, if I'm honest, well, the water tank. Now, it just feels a little bit cheap. The way it works, you've got a couple of horses that go in here and then just a large plastic tank and the cutout in the side, I don't think it's a great way to assess how much water is in your tank. As a common theme today, we're gonna complain about the valves, the steam ones. Generally they just feel a bit cheap and plasticy and I know I'm used to commercial equipment, but yeah, it feels okay. The buttons, fine. Nicely made, work well enough. What is a nice inclusion is the pressure gauge here. That is very helpful. That's a big plus for me on the build of this thing. However, the drip tray is one part of this that I don't particularly like. It's quite fussy to get in and out. There's no float in the drip tray, so you have no real way of knowing how full it is. So I always feel nervous, if I have to tip a drip tray to lift it out. That makes me concerned if I've got this a little bit too full. Now the DeLonghi Dedica is coming in at a disadvantage. It is substantially cheaper than anything else here. And you can tell that from the build. Where there might be a lot of metal in other machines, there's a lot of plastic here, even with that kind of chromed finish at the top. Its footprint is tiny and that might be a big advantage for a lot of people, but it is light and you definitely have to grip this thing when you lock it in. And for me, my instinct to grip, is to grip it around here and with my big old hands, I've occasionally pushed buttons while trying to hold the machine in a funny sort of way. And the drip tray is really very small, but it has the convenience at least of having a float to let you know when you're about to make a terrible mess of your kitchen. Water tank, removable, easy to use, clear plastic. Overall, it's what you'd expect for the money. The Rancilio Silvia is built like an absolute tank. It is by far the heaviest of the units here. Once it's on the counter where you want it to be, it's going nowhere. This was the easiest to lock in or remove the portafilter from, simply because of its weight. It was not going anywhere on the counter. Buttons, switches, very nice high quality stuff on here. You can feel the sort of build quality of kind of parts here. The steam valve is probably the best of them in terms of feel, though it still does feel like a domestic steam valve in many ways. The water tank is again, a bit of a weak point for me. It's not a great experience to remove. You've got your two horses, again it's that white plastic material, but you have no real insight into how full your tank is unless you open the lid and have a look. Drip tray, the depth and size isn't bad, but it's actually quite difficult to see how much liquid is inside it and there's no float or indicator on here to let you know that it's too full. So again, this drip tray has caught me out. The Sage Bambino Plus is a more expensive machine, but it has the build quality of something a little bit cheaper, because they spent the money on features rather than build. So lots of plastic all over the machine everywhere. It's very light and that makes it a little bit annoying to get a portafilter into and out of, it will move around on the counter unless you're holding the machine. But the other details are generally pretty good. The water tank, easily removed and it does have instructions for cleaning printed on the back. The portafilter, a little cheap and plasticy. The buttons at least feel reliable. They are a manufacturer making a lot of things with a lot of buttons, so you would expect those to be of good quality. It's not a steam valved machine. It's an electronic steam controller, which I think is interesting, but we'll talk about that when it's time to steam some milk. The drip tray is a little bit small, but it does at least have a float in there to let you know that you've got too much liquid and it's time for a little cleaning. It's a tricky one. The build doesn't feel as nice as other machines. It doesn't feel as solid, it doesn't feel as hefty but their design decision was to spend money on features, not on build and we'll see later on how that pans out. Before I get into the Gaggia, actually I need to have a quick disclaimer or disclosure, I guess my first ever coffee job was working for a company that was Gaggia UK, selling Gaggia Classics. This was back in 2003. That company no longer exists. It was a great company, I'm very grateful to my first boss, Raj Beadle for encouraging me into a coffee career, shout out to Raj. And he now has a separate business that sells these and I bought this from him. So full disclosure about the whole backstory of me and Gaggia there. The build is really very good. This is the Classic Pro, which is new to me in some ways. It has better switches across the top here, it's got a different steam wand to the kind of traditional I think they're called Panorella wands, but the build is solid. Brushed stainless everywhere, water tank can be accessed from the front and you can pull it out through the front if you want to, which makes changing water very easy, but you can just still pour in the top and fill this way, but one little gripe, we could say, the portafilter on this thing doesn't feel great. It's solid and it's hefty, it's a 58mm portafilter, but just the finish around here didn't feel premium in a way that some of the other portafilters do. Drip tray is reasonably deep, but again, no float to indicate that you're about to make a horrible horrible mess. Overall, for 399, the kind of build you would expect from a premium machine. So here's how espresso testing is gonna work. I'm gonna take a coffee that I know very well, I'm gonna use a fix recipe across all the machines, which is going to be about 18 in, to 38 grams out, in the region of 28 to maybe 32 seconds depending on the machine and the kind of setup. I want the machines to do the best job they can with the recipe, but by keeping this kind of fixed and using the same grinder, we'll be able to understand something about the pressures that the machines are putting out. Now, the first one up the Lelit, does have a pressure gauge. The others do not and they do not as the standard, all run at nine bars, which is massively frustrating, but we'll discuss more later and I'll share at the end, the different grinds settings used on the same grinder for the same recipe, just so we can see some differences. But first up, let's discuss espresso on the Lelit and having a gauge on here is really nice. Let's pull a shot. Now, before we taste, we need to stir. So I've upgraded my spoon selection. That's very important. So I'll be stirring with the fanciest little teaspoons from the 1940s, cause I'm a fancy man. Now I have to say, I have enjoyed the shots from the Anna. They have been generally sweet and balanced. What they're lacking often, is a little bit of heft, a little bit of texture, a little bit of body. That might be a function of the basket maybe not being quite good enough to allow a really fine grind for the kind of recipe I would want. So I would hope for a touch more body in the mouthfeel of the shots that I've had, but overall it has made me very tasty espresso. A little bit impressed by the Lelit. DeLonghi Dedica is a funny little machine. It has a very frustrating portafilter. So I changed the basket on this. It came with a standard pressurized portafilter basket which I don't wanna use, so I put a normal 50 formula basket in, but to do that, I had to have sort of damaged the portafilter further. It has a little insert inside it. Looks a little bit like this. I couldn't get the basket in without taking this out and in taking this out, there's a little screw here that holds the plastic piece in place. The coffee now drips out of this too. So it's a bit messy, but it's the only way I could get proper espresso from this. You don't have a ton of height between portafilter spouts and drip tray, which makes getting scales and cups under there not impossible, but not super easy. A little bit more clearance is always appreciated there. Let's pull a shot. Hmm. Now this needed a coarser grind than the Lelit and I think that's interesting and the extraction is notably lower. Now this doesn't air on the side of hot and if anything this tastes like a slightly cool shot to me. The acidity is very pronounced, the texture is okay. It doesn't feel like we've had a great extraction here. And I would say for lighter roasts, this will be a difficult setup to get good espresso from. It's running, I think at quite a high pump pressure, it's not running at a hybrid temperature. Those two things in combination, with lighter roasts will make it an enormous uphill battle. The more developed the coffee gets, the easier it's gonna be to extract and I suspect the better the shots you'll have and if you like medium through to dark espresso roast then you may have a good experience here. It's not light years better than the cheap DeLonghi that we tested in the sub-hundred pounds category. It is a little better for sure, in terms of shock quality, but not light years better. So broadly, pulling shots with the Silvia is quite a pleasant experience. The buttons are very nice, the portafilter feels very nice, but my complaint is brew temperature actually on this one. It runs a little hot. Often, you can hear and see a good amount of steam coming out of that group head. That's not ideal. So you might have to do some temperature surfing, where you pull out that very hot water by dumping it into the drip tray and then you try to catch it as it reheats at the right point to get the best possible shot. People have other mods for this but we'll talk about modding at the end. I've changed out the basket in this to a VST basket, 'cause I don't really rate the basket that came as stock. So I'm gonna use that instead. Well, economically while the drip tray is a little bit annoying, it doesn't drain super well, having that width to work with is very nice. Let's talk about the espresso. Now I've had a range of shots from the Silvia and they've all been pretty good. Having a good basket in there lets me grind finer, that's good, extractions have been even when I've used them naked portafilter. The frustration for me has been temperature. I've had shots that have had a harshness from brewing a little bit too hot, a sourness from brewing a little bit too cool. It wanders around a bit in temperature and that for me is a frustration. You can get very very good espresso from this, but you'll also get occasionally frustratingly, just kind of off espresso, from the brew temp being in a funny place. So the Sage Bambino is an interesting little machine, but unfortunately it does come with that pressurized portafilter that I just don't want or particularly need. I get that they exist for people who just want an easier life and don't want a nice grinder, but we're trying to get good espresso here and these things are worthless. So we're gonna use a proper basket in this and pull some proper shot. It's a full featured machine and you can play with stuff like pre-infusion. It's quite easy to do manual pre-infusion if you want to get into that thing, which seems contrary to having a pressurized portafilter, but they really do seem to be trying to capture the whole wide audience. There's a ton of distance from spouts to drip tray which suggests that people wanna put scales underneath. The shots, well, let's pull one now. Texture is actually okay, but it has used the coarsest ground setting so far for that flow and that doesn't yield the best tasting shots. If you're using a lighter roast like me, again we're back to that sour espresso, reasonable texture, reasonable mouthfeel but I think it's gonna be a difficult machine to absolutely get the best out of with lighter roasts. I'm just frustrated by my inability to access more features in the machine that are so key to good espresso when it has so much, you know control over other stuff like pre-infusion and shot volumes and all that sort of stuff you would want. Not bad, simply not the best of the group. So now the Gaggia Classic Pro, a machine that I'm sort of familiar with, but not. Now pulling shots from this was broadly pretty enjoyable. Again, got rid of the stock basket. Get rid of the stock basket, put a VST basket and still in there's the portafilter that I don't really love it and with a different basket, the fit is a bit frustrating here. Now one feature, this thing has, is it has a solenoid valve as a pressure release valve that dumps any excess pressure at the end of the shot into the drip tray. That does make back-to-back shots quickly, relatively easy. You don't get what someone once described as portafilter sneeze, when you immediately release the portafilter and some pressure leaks out like that. So the shots, let's pull a shot. Now, as you can see from the shot, one frustration that's very clear is the spout to drip tray height. There's not a lot of room to get a scale and a set of espresso cups in there or a cappuccino cup or whatever you want to use. Secondly, this thing definitely runs at high pressures. That's kind of a well known thing. And we'll talk about modding that later, but it did allow me to pull shots at a much finer grind setting than anything else. However, like the Rancilio, the temperature does wander around a little bit. It is possible to have it overheat and have some steam when you flush the group head or have it run below temperature. So a bit of a temperature surfing routine will yield you the best tasting espresso. As for how this shot is, pretty good. Not overly acidic, but it has a certain sort of harshness that I associate with higher pump pressures. Now that could be, and may well be confirmation bias, right? Like I'm seeing something that I expect to be there but that shot floated at a nice kind of time, 18 in 38 out in 28 to 29 seconds. That shouldn't have kind of texture and quality of woodiness and bitterness that hasn't been present in other shots. Again, we'll talk about modding, but as stock, it is frustratingly close to great, but the espressos aren't superb. Milk steaming it's a really important part of a good espresso machine at home, so that's what we're going to look at next. First test is very simple. It's just power. I've got 150 grams of cold milk, I'm gonna steam it to 60 degrees Celsius on each of the machines and we're going to see how quick it is. So aside from the speed test, which was interesting, let's talk about the actual experience of steaming milk. Now the Lelit was okay. It has underneath it, sort of auto frothing attachment, a regular steam wand that I wanted to use because that's significantly better, than using the little attachments that it comes with. It wasn't super well powered, but I got some reasonably good milk texture out of it. I wasn't upset by it. Not the slowest, not the worst. Steaming was okay. The DeLonghi Dedica has this automated sort of steam wand part that helps add foam, add air to your milk for you. This was the most difficult to get great texture from. You've got pleasantly fluffy milk, but if you wanted something a little silkier, a little bit easier to pour a latte out with, you'd really kind of struggle here. The Silvia was a beast. This was the closest to steaming with a commercial steam wand of any of these machines. It was incredibly quick, incredibly powerful. I've been steaming milk for a long time and so I loved that, but if I was new to steaming milk, this would be intimidating, this would be tricky. I would make a mess a whole bunch of times before I got my milk texturing down. So not the easiest, but if you know what you're doing, a real pleasure to steam with. Now the Sage was a surprise. You could tell going in, that milk was a big part of it's sell. It's got a full featured set around milk steaming, so you can use it as a manual sort of milk steamer, which is what I would do and what I did and the results were really very good. I thought it would be slow, but actually it gave me lots of time to do what I needed to do, to have a phase of adding air, and sort of stretching the milk and then going into a phase of kind of rolling it around. The end result was very good, not the quickest, but kind of easy to learn with. If I was teaching someone to steam milk for the first time, this would be a good machine to do it on. Now it does have some extras. It's got some automated milk steaming that lets you choose your end temperature. There's a little thermometer built into the drip tray and it'll let you choose your texture as well. That's great, if you don't wanna get into how to steam milk and you want some good results, that's kind of impressive to me. And again, where they've skimped on build, they've really gone hard on features and milk is a big one here. So this was a pleasant surprise. The manual stealing was very good. Now with the Gaggia, I was actually a little disappointed. It felt underpowered. So much so that I had to steam twice to check that I hadn't done something wrong or you know, something had gone awry, but actually we repeated exactly the same result on both tests. I had no problem stretching the milk, but where I wanted to kind of roll it around and texture it and mix it. That's where it just didn't seem to have enough pressure and power and that was a bit disappointing and it was notable that it was the slowest of them. I got some great texture out of it. I just wanted a bit more pressure from it. So what I'll do now is I'll summarize very quickly, the kind of overall experience of each of the machines. The Lelit, I was a little bit impressed by. It's a new brand to me, it's the first time I've used one of their machines, there's a couple of little weak points on it, the milk steaming and the basket that its ships with and the fact that it has a 57 millimeter portafilter for me is a slight frustration, but it produced good results. And I think with a better basket, you'd get a notable increase in shock quality. I think it's very good value for the money at 350 pounds and comparing it to say something at 190 pounds, you could absolutely see where your money is going. That DeLonghi is okay, for the money, but it's a machine at that price point that says to me it's worth spending more. You get better milk steaming, you get better shots, you get a better build, you get a better experience all around. So I really wouldn't recommend the DeLonghi necessarily, but I would understand if you were really budget-constricted you can get okay espresso from it. It might frustrate you if you want really great textured flat whites or cafe lattes. The Silvia is the closest to a commercial machine of the group here. It's right at the beginning of that kind of prosumer category where you get sort of miniature commercial machines for the home. The steaming on this thing really impressed me. The build is fantastic. It is heavy, it's hefty, it's very well made. All of the componentry seems extremely good, but for 529 pounds, I'm annoyed that if I owned this I would wanna mod it further and that would cost me at least a hundred pounds plus to add a PID to it, to control the temperature for it. Now there is a substantial community out there of Silvia owners who will help you out. There's tons of guides, there's tons of kits. You would be joining a kind of ecosystem of owners and people who modeled these machines if that's what you're into. I would just be slightly frustrated that at the most expensive machine, there's still stuff I want to tweak and change. That has a pretty substantial impact on the espresso. Now the Sage is super interesting. It's about the same price as the Gaggia, but they couldn't be further apart where you might have a substantial modifying community for the Rancilio or actually for the Gaggia, you're not going to find one for the Sage. This is not a machine you're gonna tinker with or play with, it's not one you're going to get under the hood and mess with. It's too complicated. It's just not built that way. It does have a ton of features and I think they've really identified an audience of people who want good espresso, great milk drinks who don't necessarily wanna become hobbyist baristas. This is for somebody who wants a very enjoyable experience, who maybe wants to go through the process of making their own coffee, but they don't want to have to spend too much time investing in their own skillset. Now to round us out, we've got the Gaggia Classic Pro. Now I did enjoy using this, I know there's a little bit nostalgia for me, but it's well-built it can pull good shots. Like the Silvia, I would want to modify it to have better brew temperatures and actually I'd probably want to modify it to do better brew pressures. All you would need to do is change some springs and bits inside the over-pressure valve, it's not very expensive and you'll get much better shots. But it requires you voiding your warranty, opening this thing up, tinkering with parts inside and that's not for everyone. And the way that they're built, they seem to carry a lasting value and that's kind of the difference. I expect these two machines to hold their value much better than these two machines. The Gaggia, was pretty good. I like this machine, I think for the money it's good value. I wish it had a bit more steaming power. I wish the temperature was a little bit more stable. I wish it brewed at nine bars, but you can fix those problems. Personally, if I got to keep one of these, which one would I keep? Well, I'd be torn between these two probably, because I'm open to modding and I'm interested in that. So these two are in a similar category. But if milk is important, this really is a fantastic little espresso machine for milk steaming. But of course, I don't get to keep these.", "videoID": "7HIGdYy5of4"}, {"title": "How I Dial-In Espresso - Part #1", "text": "Today, I'm gonna talk to you about how I dial in an espresso. What I've got in my hopper here, is a coffee I've never used before. I've never tasted it. I don't really know how to dial it in, the grinder's definitely not set up for it. So I'm gonna go through the process of dialing in, going through adjusting my dose, my grind, my recipe, my ins, my outs. All of those things to get the best tasting shot that I can. Now, the audio in here is not great, so I'm gonna be talking to you afterwards, talking you through the process and I'll try and capture as much as I can of what's going on here behind the machine. So this is the setup. I'm using a Mythos One and using a Black Eagle Gravitech and a little old house there to track my doses. It's an 18 grand BST basket in there so I'm going to dose about 18 grams disturbing the poke with a teaspoon like this is not ideal, but if you're trying to get somewhere quickly, it's okay as a way to kind of trim your dose down without messing with the copy too much. I'll explain more about this particular technique a little bit later in the video. Now, this coffee, I had a quick look at at the start and it was pretty light, right? So I could see for espresso, it was going to be a challenge. I didn't know much about it it was a single origin coffee but it was a pretty light roast. So this first shot, I'm just going to see what I get you know, see what the grind is, see where everything is, that's my starting point. Now this shot was bad. If you look at the recipe, you're talking about 18 grams in 40 grams out in 34 seconds. So my gut feeling was that would be a little bit slow, taste-wise harsh, muddy, intensely sour, unpleasant not at all good and the aftertaste was bad. We've brewed too slow. I wouldn't say necessarily overly under extracted but it's just not a particularly delicious espresso. So I'm going to go a little bit coarser I'm going to keep the dose at about 18. I'm going to aim for about 38 out and I'm just going to track my runtime to see where my grind is. Like I'm looking for something in the very late twenties I suspect to taste good but that's just, you know, typical of my kind of setup and my kind of espresso preference. So let's see how this one brews. The shot finishes in about 25 seconds and it doesn't taste good, it definitely tastes under extracted. We've definitely brushed too fast. I have made too big of an adjustment to my grind I've gone too coarse. So that's what I'm going to do now. I'm going to work on just moving that grind just fractionally finer to get me closer to where I want to be. Again everything else I'm really going to keep the same. So here's shot number three. And just by going that little bit finer we've gone a little bit slower, we're at like a 27 second brew time now, just a little slower but definitely more extracted, the espresso did taste better a little bit more extracted, a bit more balanced but it's not quite there yet. Again, I'm going to take my grind up just a little bit finer here I feel like I'm trending in the right direction, shots are tasting better. I just want to up that extraction a little bit more. Now at at 18 in 38 39 out in 29 seconds, it's looking pretty good. The shot isn't bad by any stretch but I still feel it could be improved. I'd still like to get more extraction out of it. So as I'm cleaning up here, I'm thinking about it and I'm thinking, why don't I just keep the grind where it is and just push a little bit more liquid through it. I'm using the little decent dosing funnel just to help redistribute the coffee. If it's not perfectly distributed coming out of the grinder that just helps provide a more, even bed before tamping. So all I'm going to do is, is basically repeat the shot but let it go from 38, up to 42 grams that's going to give me more liquid in the cup. I'm going to lose some concentration but I'm happy to trade that off for a bit more extraction and a little bit more sweetness. And this shot, this shot is really pretty good. I enjoyed the shot, it had good clarity. It still had enough texture it was on the more acidic end but ultimately that's the raw material that I'm working with in this situation with a lighter roast I should have realistic expectations about how much acidity I'm going to have in my balanced end espresso. Now I do think I can improve this recipe a little bit further. I think there's one last change that's worth making before I make that change. I'm just going to tell you about this video sponsor, which is Skillshare. Now Skillshare is an online learning community with thousands of classes covering different creative and entrepreneurial skills. I'm a Skillshare premium member and that means that for my $10 a month if I sign up annually, I get access to literally every single course it's unlimited access which I think is fantastic. Now I definitely use Skillshare to help improve my video making skills, to improve my approach to producing better videos for you. But there's a lot more to it than that at the moment I'm enjoying Thomas Frank's productivity masterclass. This is the kind of class we'll pick up something in every section one little thing to improve the way that you work. And I would recommend it really highly but you don't have to take my word for it. Because Skillshare is sponsoring this video, you can sign up with the link in my description and you get two months free Skillshare unlimited access to everything there. Thanks to Skillshare for sponsoring this video. And so we're back to this final change. Now, one thing I want to do is actually just drop my dose a little bit more. I want to up the extraction here a little bit more. So I'm going to go a little finer again. I'm going to go from 18 down to about 17 but I'm still going to aim for 42 grams out. So again, this is a much weaker kind of recipe here but I think I'll be rewarded with a little bit more extraction using this coffee makes extraction a little easier. I can go finer, there's less coffee to extract and by using this higher ratio, I stand a much better chance of getting a more balanced espresso here and that's what I got. This was super drinkable, super tasty, sweet, clean not a ton of texture, but enough to still feel satisfying. Now when making this video it became clear that this is just one coffee. This is just one opportunity and I can't really get into every aspect of dialing in without exploring lots of different coffees lots of different styles of espresso. So I'm going to make this a series, this is the first part. This covers a kind of light roast high grown single origin espresso.", "videoID": "lFwJF-_SUr0"}, {"title": "Coffee Brewing Ratios Explained", "text": "That is real coffee, as delicious as the best cup of coffee, you've ever had brewed. - Today, we're gonna talk about ratios for coffee brewing. How much coffee should I use to brew a cup of coffee in terms of filter coffee? Now I'm gonna talk about this in three separate stages. I'm gonna talk about why I'm gonna recommend a certain type of ratios of using grams per liter, and then I'm gonna talk about kinda finding your ideal ratio. And finally I'm gonna talk about why I might recommend a different ratio for different brewing methods. So first thing, why would I recommend grams per liter? There's a number of different ways people do recipes and ratios. The most common ones still is to recommend scoops per cup. There's no international standard for scoops. A scoop can contain about seven grams. It could contain about 10 or 12 grams. Now the problem I have with scoops or cups or tablespoons or teaspoons, or all of that sort of stuff is that they're volumetric measurements. Which means that they'll have massive fluctuations in actual weight depending on a few different factors. For example, if I were to use, let's say a dark roast, medium ground coffee and I have a perfect level scoop of that, that might weigh around seven, seven and a half grams. If I went for a light roast finer ground coffee, that might weigh eight, eight and a half grams, well over 10% more, and that's me being really careful in loading the same volume each time. It's very easy to have small variances in that volume result in pretty big variances in the gram weight that you're using. In the day-to-day morning coffee brewing, using scoops will mean that some days your coffee is good and some days it's not. Even though you seemingly did the same thing, but volumetric measurements, they're just not very reliable. Then there's the other commonly used ratios of like one to 14, one to 15, one to 16. These break my head, I can't deal with these. They kind of work completely backwards to me. Those kinds of ratios are pretty useful. If you know how much ground coffee you have and you wanna work out how much coffee you can make. That is never a problem I have, in the mornings. Usually, I have a desired amount of coffee that I wanna brew and I wanna work out, how much ground coffee I need, you know what weight of coffee I need to start with. So, using a one to 15 ratio. I can't do the maths on that, if I need 500 mL of coffee, I'm not dividing 500 by 15 first thing in the morning. However, if you give me a grams per liter, well, if I'm brewing half a liter than I need. If at 60 grams a liter, then I need half that, which is 30 that's not, I don't need my phone and a calculator for that. I can just do a quick little bit of maths. I like it also because typically a cup, an average cup is about 250 mL of brewing or about eight ounces and that scales really nicely. Whether I'm making one or two or three or four or more, two to the grams per liter ratio. You know I'm using half a liter, a full liter, three quarters of a liter. The maths is never complicated. And there's one other kind of ratio that deserves a special place in hell. The mixed unit ratio, if you are recommending grams per ounce, get out, get out, go away, you do not belong. Just get, that's all. What are you doing? That's the worst thing in the world. Don't, ah, I mean, you know, the Imperial, I have no time for that to begin with, but don't be mixing Imperial and metric that is no, stop it. Rant aside. We end up at grams per liter. I think it's a really nice, neat way to work. So if it's a 60 grams per liter doing the mass with that, that's very, very easy. It's very, very usable. And this leads us into the second part of this video. What is the right amount of coffee per liter of water? And this is a really important point that becomes a little bit complicated. There is no correct ratio. There is only preference. The ratio of coffee to water you use is really gonna determine how strong the end cup of coffee is, how strong you like your coffee. that's up to you, right? That's, your decision. I shouldn't get a say. I'll give a good starting point, right? Like I think 60 grams per liter is a pretty good one-size-fits-all. Most people are happy with the resulting strength of a good brew, but you can choose 55, 50, 75 that's up to you. But, there's one complicating factor in the world of coffee brewing and that is extraction. I'll give a very quick primer on extraction. In ground coffee, about approximately, about a third of it is soluble material. It could be dissolved by water. Two thirds of it pretty much is insoluble. It's cellulose, it's kind of wood. You could steep that coffee, brew their coffee forever. You still have some grounds left over that you would throw away afterwards. You don't want everything that is soluble and available in coffee. You want, broadly speaking, for the sake of easy maths in the video to come, about to 20%. Some would prefer a little bit more, 22, maybe 23, maybe even more, but let's say for the sake of argument about 20%. If you do a good job of brewing your coffee, that will have a nice resulting strength, but if you didn't do a good job, brewing that coffee, that 60 grams liter would produce a weaker cup. Let's say, you under extracted it, you ground it to too coarse, you brew too quickly, however it happened, you end up with a weak cup. So if you're trying to change your ratio, if you're trying to work out your ideal ratio, you only want to change the ratio, once you're really happy with the taste. If you've brewed a cup of coffee and you think that was delicious, I just wish it was a fraction stronger. That's the time to change your ratio. If you brew a cup of coffee and you think that's a bit weak, it's a bit sour, it's not really delicious. Don't change your ratio. Change your extraction. Grind a little finer, steep, a little longer, agitate a little bit more. Those things need to be fixed first before you mess with your ratio. Once you're happy with taste, sure experiment. In my life, I kinda wandered around in terms of what I prefer in terms of the end strength of my cup of coffee. It's a personal thing. Whatever you like is okay. There is no one answer to this question. This brings us into the third part of this video, which is why I might recommend using a different ratio for different brewing methods. Now you can broadly divide all coffee brewing methods into two camps. Percolation and infusion. Now with percolation, water is passing through a bed of coffee. In infusion, all of the water, and all of the coffee are hanging out together during the brew time. A pour-over is percolation. A French press, an AeroPress. Those are infusion methods. Now, I would recommend using a little bit more coffee for an infusion method than I would for a pour-over for a percolation method. I'll explain why. Let's imagine for the sake of argument, we're gonna brew a liter of coffee and we're gonna use 60 grams per liter. That's a good starting point, and in this theoretical brew, we're gonna extract 20% of the coffee, right? So it means that of those 60 grams, about 12 grams were dissolved and brought into the liquid coffee. Now when you brew a percolation, when you brew a pour-over, not all of the water that you pour in, ends up in the brew. Typically, about two grams per gram of coffee get absorbed by the ground coffee. That bed still contains a good amount of water and that water never really got involved in the brewing process. So what you have in the resulting brew, is 12 grams of coffee dissolved in round about 880 grams of water. If you take a French press and you do the same thing, you brew 60 grams per liter, those 12 grams of solubles that we've extracted, that 20% extraction, that's now dissolved into a thousand grams of water. All a thousand grams we're involved in the brewing process and those solubles are distributed amongst the whole thing, that makes that brew weaker, even though it's the same extraction. That's why if you want a similar extraction and a similar strength, I would recommend using more coffee, in my infusions. 70 grams, maybe 75 grams per liter of water. If you dive into extraction theory and you start playing the refractometers, you'll notice that the software does ask you to specify if it's an immersion or a percolation, because it does affect your extraction calculations. But more than that, it really just affects the strength and the taste. So that's why with any infusion brew, any brew where all of the ground is in contact with all of the brew water for a period of time, even if in the case of an AeroPress, you're gonna push that liquid through the bed of coffee at the end. It was still an infusion. Any pour-over I would recommend about 60 grams a liter. Any infusion brew, I'd recommend about 75 grams a liter. I think those are both great starting points, but they're not the answer. Don't take it as gospel. Find your own way. Find your own preferences. If they are too weak too strong, well change them. Being consistent in how you brew, and that means weighing the amount of coffee going in and ideally weighing the amount of water too means that you actually understand what's affecting your morning coffee. You don't have to make decisions, you don't have to guesstimate the amount of water you poured in or the amount of coffee you're brewing, especially frankly, before you've had coffee. So, get a set of scales. This is a great starting point. I'd love to hear what you're brewing at home. I'd love also to hear more about your journey.", "videoID": "ipB6P1uzNYM"}, {"title": "Creating A Better Dairy Alternative", "text": "Today, we're going to be talking about plant-based milks, dairy alternatives, specifically for coffee. This is a project that I've been working on for a few months now and as a result, I obviously have a bias here. I have invested interest in the success of this and you should know that going in. But I think there's some super interesting stuff in the process, in the development of this that I wanted to share. So a little while back, I was approached by a company called Rebel Kitchen. They're a small UK based privately owned company and they do plant based alternatives. And they've actually done plant based alternatives to dairy before, but one's kind of a daily use to put on your cereal in the morning, put in tea, but but not something specifically for coffee and cafes. Because when you bring coffee into it, particularly espresso, you bring a host of different challenges. Once you bring it in steaming and texturing milk, there are even more challenges and overcoming those was really fun, was really interesting. And I learned a bunch of stuff that I kind of wanna share. Now, I've been interested like many people in plant based alternatives for a little while now. And there's a number of reasons driving that. And that was one of the big motivations for me actually to work on this project. Now, from being honest, historically speaking, go back five maybe 10 years, plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy weren't very good. They didn't taste particularly nice, they weren't particularly enjoyable and they were chosen for a host of other reasons outside of taste. And I think what we've seen more of in the last couple of years is that people are willing to make a switch, people are willing to consume plants over meat, over dairy as long as it doesn't feel like a compromise. People don't want anything less than a great cappuccino, a great flat white. And so that's been a big barrier for a long time for people switching away from dairy. Now, one thing I couldn't help but note is that there are a bunch of dairy alternatives out there but they seem like weirdly monogamous affairs. It's oat and nothing but oat or it's almond and nothing but almond or it's soya, nothing but soya, you get the point. What actually appealed to me about this project is that they wanted to look at a much broader spectrum of plants to chase down this no compromise alternative that that definitely appealed to me. Dairy milk is kind of amazing. And at no point could I deny that coffee plus dairy is delicious. It really does taste wonderful, a lot of people enjoy that combination of coffee's flavor, softened by milk, sweetened by milk enriched by milk. That makes for a lovely combination enjoyed the world over, can't argue with that. But there's more complexity to what milk is doing, there's more challenge in the replication of that. And there are two broad categories to worry about here. You've got taste and that's, how does it feel to drink, how does it taste, what kind of flavors does it have? And in the coffee world, you've got texture. How does it steam, how does it pour, how does it sit in the cup? Does it last, does it fall to pieces? These are two technically different puzzles and solving one can unsolved another one, that's the frustration of this whole deal. Now it's very important in this video that you hear from someone who really, really really knows what they're talking about. So I'd like to introduce you to one of the food scientists from Rebel, meet Zara. Hi, my name is Zara. I am the product developer for Rebel Kitchen and today we're gonna be talking about Rebel Kitchen Barista Mylk. And to give you an idea of how deeply immersed in this project she is, I asked her pretty early on in the conversation, how many iterations, how many recipes they'd gone through for this particular product. I think there was like 146. 146? Yeah. And that was probably the quickest we've done it. Okay, let's talk some foam science. When you steam milk, you are introducing air to it. You're creating foam and you're using the steam wand to drag air down and push it in. And then you're going to use the steam wand to kinda whisk that foam down so the bubbles are so small that they're pretty much invisible. This requires something that foams and lots of things can foam in these kind of situations. Oat is a great addition for this particular thing. But what you also need from a texture perspective is not just this marshmallowy gooey foamy goodness, you need some fat. And fat's a bit of a problem. Fat is one of the things that we really enjoy in dairy milk. A lot of people like whole milk for that texture and fat does impact flavor as well. Fat inhibits flavor release a little bit so you have a less intense cappuccino if it's full fat but it does linger in the mouth a little bit longer. A skim milk version would have a much more intense sort of short burst of flavor, but just wouldn't really hang around. But fat also can inhibit foam formation and certainly inhibit foam stability. And that's the kind of push-pull in this kinda thing. You want enough fat that feels very nice to drink but not so much that it damages it in terms of its foamability. But there is one more role that fat plays. And that's the viscosity of the whole thing. When you steam milk, before you pour that foamed milk into the cup, you generally swell the pitcher and this causes the liquid milk to be whisked and sort of swirled back into the foam, making the foam heavy enough that when you tilt the jug, foam is dragged out with the liquid underneath. And at that point you can pour latte art, you can produce beautiful looking coffees. If you didn't do that, then when you tip the jug, a sort of dry raft of foam would sit back and liquid would flow from underneath. If your milk lacks that thickness, that viscosity, it will be difficult to work with, it'll drain too quickly. So making sure you've got that viscosity is actually super important from a practical technical perspective when you're using the stuff behind a coffee bar. And then there's one more little twist, which is how does that firm hold up once it's poured. And actually here, I think they did an amazing job. In a bunch of testing the foam from this outlast the foam from dairy milk by quite a considerable amount. It's kind of been weird for me to be drinking cappuccinos and flat whites on the regular again. I'd pretty much stopped for over a decade for a host of different reasons. And it's kind of fun coming back to this all again. Now, one of the big things I wanted to talk to Zara about for this video was the ingredients of the end product. You know, you look at the back of a pack and there's a few different things there and you might want to know why. And so that's what I'll share with you now. Me talking to Zara, going through ingredient by ingredient, and getting some more explanation about the thought process and the development process that went into selecting them and getting them tuned to this particular recipe. Okay, so first water, obviously second oats, oats, oat milk seems very popular. What's oat doing in this? It's giving you a little bit of the body, it's giving you a little bit of the texture, it's helping kind of smooth everything out. But it's also giving you a little bit of flavor, little bit of sweetness that isn't overpowering, it's not too harsh or too strong. Obviously oat is a really popular ingredient within the coffee space because of its neutrality, let's say. But we wanted to kind of take that but also innovate one, one extra on that. And that's why there's other ingredients in that too. So the next one is interesting to me which is coconut cream 'cause in tasting this, at no point did I think it tasted of coconut. But I associate coconut cream with having quite an intense coconut flavor. Coconut cream is actually a really, really lovely base and we use it in our semi-skimmed and whole milk. But we didn't put it in there in too much of a percentage inclusion for you to taste it 'cause obviously it's quite a strong taste and it could take away from the coffee. It's gone really lovely texture, it's really velvety and we found that actually it really helped with the, the tightness of the micro-foam and actually how velvety the milk ended up being, but kind of getting that balance without it coming through too much as a flavor and just in there as a function and mouthfeel kind of. Next one is the sunflower oil. This Actually came through when you were in and you were testing our different milks out and we were kind of trying to understand what was working and what wasn't quite early stage. And we found that actually it would have been great to have even more coconut in there, so you just add even more body. But as you said, it comes through in the flavor too much so we needed a secondary source of fat, which is where the sunflower oil came in. Just really lovely, organic, pressed sunflower oil, not solvent extracted. And it just gave it a little bit more texture, a little bit more body and it really helped with the mouth feel and the velvetyness of it again in the micro foam. So, yeah, that was a turning point 'cause we, originally were just going to use the coconut and we found actually it wasn't right for the product and we needed to. So the next one is a little interesting to me which is fava bean protein. The fava bean was a really interesting one. We started off with hemp. And we found that the hemp just gave too many flavor notes to the product and it was just a bit too bitter and it just took away from the neutral profile we were going for. So we found the fava bean which was really lovely, organically grown in Finland. And it's just kind of grown, dehold and ground into a flower. And it's got a lovely texture, a lovely savory profile, just a hint of savory, but really neutral. And we were able to add it in there at just the right balance to have it come through but not be too overpowering to the rest of the profile. Sunflower seed extract. The sunflower seed extract is a really nice ingredient. It actually just keeps everything bound together and there are a lot of sort of similar ingredients out there which are quite harshly extracted with alcohols or acids or, you know, just quite harshly processed. But for us, we use one which is, it's really lovely, it's water processed, so it's super gentle and it still does the same thing that you needed to do but without being so harsh and that's something really important for Rebel Kitchen. All of our ingredients go through a really, really extensive kind of approval process to make sure, you know, is this factory or is this supplier adhering to good environmental practice and good ethical policies and just around the farming of the product, that's so important to us. I mean, going back as, as much as we can and getting all that detail. Not only cause we're organic but also because we're a B Corp. So that's really important to us from a, just a governing point of view too to really know what's in our products and really be sure of the quality. 'Cause if you start off with good quality ingredients, I mean, you're already halfway there. So nutritional yeast, I presume it's a flavor thing. It's used in a lot of vegan cooking to kind of give a bit of a cheesy note. So obviously we're not putting it in there to taste cheesy but it's just a touch to give it a kind of savory dairy note. So it works really well with the fava bean, but it's in that such a low quantity that you wouldn't necessarily taste it or detect it, It just adds a slight dimension. Potassium carbonate, which is a seam acting as a buffer 'cause you're dealing with coffee being super acidic and that's often a problem. Because we organic, we have really strict guidelines about what we can and can't put in our products. So from the ones that we were able to put in, we tested them all out. Some were great, some had a really quite bitter aftertaste, quite saline after taste and we found that actually potassium carbonate was the most neutral, but also gave it just enough kind of buffer, just softened it enough without taking away too much of the flavor. Last one, the sea salt. This was really a tricky one because we were getting a lot of bitterness. I played with like every ingredient, taking it down, adding in a little bit more and I just couldn't get rid of the bitterness at all. And I thought, you know, this is probably coming from the coffee. Like I've tried everything. And it was just a touch of salt which actually takes away the bitterness, which is, I know something you've touched on before as well. Like it really works. Until now it's live. It's officially launched, it's out there in the world and I'm excited about that. If you wanna try it and hope you do, but if you're curious, there's a few different ways to do so down below.

It's the caffe shakerato, shaken coffee. Really, a very simple drink. A few key tweaks, it can be absolutely fantastic. Not only are we gonna do a classic version today, but a couple of other twists to give you some ideas of how you maybe can play with it to create something a little bit more fun, something that you'll really, really, really enjoy. Now, historically, the caffe shakerato had been in and out of fashion. Some people are true believers. Tim Wendelboe has served it in his cafe in Oslo for a really long time. I know the Coffee Collective served it in their cafes for quite a while, though they don't anymore. It's one that's maybe forgotten a little bit by the wider coffee industry, and I don't think it should be. I think it's really, really good, not just because it's actually really, really simple. So the idea is this, this is the classic drink, you take an espresso or two, shake it over ice with some sugar and some salt, strain it, serve it in a chilled glass, deliciousness. Super simple, super easy. In the shaking, you give it a nice, thick, foamy head, and it's really nice to drink. If you nail the sweetness, once it's chilled, it's really balanced, really enjoyable, really intense, just a great hot summer day, start the day off right kind of drink. So we'll start with this classic version of the recipe, and, if you go online, you'll see a few different things and a few different techniques and that kind of stuff. I'll tell you what's really worked for me. Firstly, you'll see some people say you need to use sugar, undissolved sugar, in the drink to get a better head of foam. That I have not found to be true. In fact, I would recommend using some sort of syrup, one, because it's practical, and two, because it will all 100% dissolve. In some of my testing, the sugar didn't always completely dissolve, which meant a varying sweetness in the finished drink, and that's not okay. Today, I'm gonna be using a 1:1 syrup. So it's equal parts sugar and water to make the syrup. You can make that in a blender, you don't necessarily need to heat the water. It doesn't last as long as a 2:1 syrup, but it's really easy to be accurate with it. You're not accidentally gonna slightly overdose and make the drink a little bit too sweet. We are gonna weigh everything. Don't worry, that's how it's gonna go. But it just gives you that extra layer of accuracy, so I like it in this situation. So let's start building the drink. We're gonna use shaker tins today. If you're using a smaller cocktail shaker, there's a little twist to the technique, just to stop bad things happening. If you've got a shaker set like this, you'll be totally fine. So, into here, I'm gonna add 10 grams of my 1:1 syrup. So that'll be about five grams of sugar, essentially, in the drink. To that, I'm gonna add two drops, which is about 0.1, 0.15 grams of saline solution. It's in 20 to 80, salt to water. I've talked a lot in the past about using salt in coffee drinks. I think, especially when you're chilling coffee down, it can just take the edge off the bitterness. You don't wanna taste salt. You just want to have a little bit of saline to sweeten things up, round things up a little bit more. So now, I'm gonna pull my shot, and I did test letting the shot cool down first, before putting it in to see if that reduced dilution made the whole thing more delicious. Turns out it didn't really make much difference at all, so don't worry about doing that. So, while it's pulling, I will get my ice. Don't forget, you need enough ice to chill the drink down, but also, have enough cubes left, unmelted, that, during the shaking, they're gonna do a lot of aeration. You're gonna shake to chill and shake to create foam. So make sure you shake for long enough when the time comes. The one twist is that, if you're using a small shaker, once your coffee's in, swirl it around a little bit before you put the lid on. Otherwise, when you start to shake, a buildup of pressure can cause the lid to pop off slightly and that makes a terrible mess. Shout out to Klaus from the Coffee Collective for that little tip. But, with a large set of shakers like this, I don't generally have any issues. Let's go. Obviously, a nice, cold glass. And there, you have a classic caffe shakerato. How is it? Nicely chilled. In terms of coffee flavor, not too sweet. That's really important to me. I don't want too much sweetness. Really nice and balanced, chilled, tons of intensity of flavor, nice texture. That little foamy head is lovely. This, on a bright, sunny morning, perfect. Your preferences may vary. I would be tempted to double-strain this, to use a finer-mesh sieve as well, just to catch any ice chips if you don't like those. If you don't really care about it, you're fine. But this might be one to double-strain if you're a little fussy about texture. Now, I was thinking about this drink and thinking about ways you could twist it or mix it up, or play with it a little bit to enhance a particular coffee that you might be using. So the next recipe is one I hope is inspiring for you to go and play with, a certain coffee that you love and make a little shakerato out of that. Here's the plan. Firstly, we're gonna tweak the syrup. Here, I've made an Earl Grey syrup. It's still a 1:1 syrup, and it's just been infused with really good quality Earl Grey tea. It's aromatic, it's got that lovely bergamot tea quality, very delicious. In addition, we're gonna also use some orange Angostura. We are going to be very, very sparing with this. Barely a dash, I'll give you the weights in a second. But it adds, again, some really lovely aromatics and complexity to the drink. As for the coffee, I'm gonna use a coffee from Rwanda. You could use a coffee from Ethiopia. A washed coffee from there would work really super well. This has just got a little bit more fruit, a little bit more texture, and I think it'll be lovely. Now, I'm gonna pull it in a way that's slightly updosed, pulled very slightly short, because I'm not worried about acidity. I'm gonna balance the acidity out with my syrup. So I want as much fruity punch from the espresso as possible. I'm not gonna make a bad espresso, but I'm gonna make one that's very slightly unbalanced, because I can correct that in how I put the drink together. Earl Grey syrup, I'm gonna use 12 grams this time, because, as I said, we're gonna use a bit more sweetness to counteract a slightly more acidic espresso. Plus, I want as much Earl Grey flavor as possible in that drink. I want it to have some nice aromatics of that bergamot coming through. 0.2 grams of Angostura orange. This is for a single drink, a little goes a long way. And, of course, our two drops, 0.1-ish grams of saline. Now, we'll pull our shot, ice in, give it a shake, and make something pretty tasty. That smells very pretty. A little of the Angostura orange, a little bit of the Earl Grey. That is lovely. That plays into the complexity of the coffee very nicely. It's that little bit sweeter. Not gonna lie, it's a little bit sweeter. But it's nice. It's really good. This is a little afternoon pick-me-up. It's just a lovely, sat outside, being happy to be in the sunshine kind of drink. The fruit qualities of the coffee marry really nicely with the tea syrup, with the Angostura. That is a great drink. I would recommend that, actually. If you've got a suitable coffee, it doesn't have to be something like a washed Ethiopian, but something, fruitful wood, nice and sweet. You might wanna bring the sweetness back a touch. That's your call. I really like it where it is. You could garnish this if you wanted to. I wouldn't, I would just let the foam be the garnish on top. It's interesting, unusual, different to most coffee drinks, and just makes the whole thing a real pleasure to drink from a textural perspective. Really, super enjoyable.

So, drink three, version three. Initially, I just wanted to have some fun with some more modernist approaches to this thing. But, actually, it ended up being a project about practical drink builds. In talking to Klaus at the Coffee Collective, he said they'd stopped serving it, because it was just frustrating from a service point of view in a busy coffee bar to stop, put it all together, shake it up, strain it out, do all this kind of stuff. It's just not how coffee bars are built. So I began to think about two different things. One, could you play with the texture of the foam on the drink a little bit? And, two, was there a more practical approach for a coffee bar service? I began to think about using one of these. It's a cream whipper. And we can use nitrous for this, and that can be a little bit like nitro cold brew. You can get a nice head that way. And I thought maybe we can tweak the texture slightly, and I'll talk about that in a second. But, if I filled this with espresso, with my shakerato mix, and then, I filled it with nitrous, and then, discharged it and re-pressurized it again, I'd have a very low oxygen environment in here, which would slow the oxidation of the coffee, and it should hold for longer. In fact, what's in here is three hours old and, having tasted it just now, it tastes pretty much as good as it did when we first made it. So, for this, you're gonna need to scale up. And, in this recipe, this was five double espressos. And everything else was just 5Xed, so it's 50 grams of syrup, about a little bit under a gram of saline. That's what we're aiming to do. Now, to tweak the texture, I used xanthan gum. There's loads of different things you can use to thicken liquids. You could use some gelling agents, but xanthan is easy, available, it's cheap. It's not a freaky thing that makes people uncomfortable. It's naturally derived, it's useful. The tricky bit with xanthan is the percentages you want to use. Of the finished drink, you're looking at 0.05% by weight of that drink being xanthan. And, if your drink weighs 50 grams, well, that's not very much xanthan at all. That's a fraction of a gram. How do you do that? So what we did is we scaled it into the syrup mix. So, to make a simple syrup of equal parts water and sugar, we added the xanthan in there to thicken the syrup very slightly. But then, once you scaled that down, once you diluted it into the drink, you got the appropriate percentage by weight. Don't do what I did and get the decimal point wrong, and add 10 times more than you need. That was a very unpleasant experience. Now, you could probably go a little bit lower again if you wanted to, if you didn't love the texture. It'll change the way that the foam stabilizes and holds in the drink. But, this way, I think it's really quite nice. One other important thing is getting the level of nitrous in here right. Now, the easiest way to control for this is actually just to weigh this after you charge it. A typical canister weighs, in my experience, about 7.6 grams, in terms of the amount of gas it adds to this. The first one you load in, you're gonna discharge completely, because that will get rid of almost all the oxygen in here, which will really slow oxidation. You're gonna add your second one, and then, I would recommend somewhere between three and four grams be retained. It's confusing, and it's a bit frustrating. You'll need to play around with it a little bit. If you're making a larger batch, you can retain more nitrous, and then, it's obviously relevant to the size of this thing overall as well. But play, tweak, record what you're doing, and then, it's really easy to replicate it from that point on. This has been kept in an ice bath up until now. It still should be nice and cold. Let me get a cold glass and get a drink going. Now, remember, this is a pressurized vessel. Don't open all the way, straightaway. It's got a bit of force to it. Give it a little shake, and then, just be gentle. Now, you can fill a little fuller, because this actually has a bit more gas in it. So the serve size isn't actually as big as a normal, traditional shakerato. This is a lot of foam, and that will stay as foam for a bit longer. This gives it a very light, fluffy, enjoyable texture. You can see it very slowly starting to settle. Now, this is nice in that it's gonna be foam a little bit longer. Again, with your coffee, your recipe, feel free to tweak the xanthan level, but it's definitely a fun aspect of this. That texture is just very lovely. It's creamy. Obviously, it's dairy free, but it has that rich, creamy mouthfeel. Really super enjoyable. This foam will last longer than a traditional shakerato, but it won't last forever. But get it to the customer, get it in your face as quickly as you can. Nice and cold, nicely balanced, really, a lot like the first drink we made, just with a little textural lift that I think is really good. It doesn't taste like it was made over three hours ago. So, if I was doing this in a cafe or doing it for a group of friends, this is a really useful way to do it if you've got a cream whipper lying around. And there's one more point.", "videoID": "XYUuot8lJAY"}, {"title": "Mixing Coffee Beans and Liquid Nitrogen - A Surprisingly Good Idea", "text": "Today, we're gonna be doing some grownup coffee science and some weird coffee science, because finally I've got my hands on some liquid nitrogen, kind of as much as I want, 'cause I'm here at Cometeer and here at Cometeer, they have a lot of liquid nitrogen.

Now, if you're unfamiliar with Cometeer, they buy delicious coffees, extract them, and flash freeze them, so all you have to do is melt that back into hot water to have a delicious cup of coffee, which means they've got lots of liquid nitrogen and so we're gonna be replicating, to start with, the experiments of Chris Hendon. Now, before we continue, there's a couple of disclosures I should make. I'm here at Cometeer because they're extracting and I'm gonna taste some Square Mile's coffee to go into the capsules. And secondly, I do have an ongoing relationship with Cometeer, which means that you should absolutely treat this video as an ad. Chris Hendon wrote a paper, he was the lead author on a paper in 2015, that basically convinced everyone that grinding frozen coffee beans was better. His research showed that the colder the coffee was, the more uniform the particle size, and also the finer the coffee ground. Now I'm not saying the science is wrong, I just want to check, I just want to repeat it. So the first thing we're gonna do is kind of replicate that thing, but let's get into the science. For that, we need some liquid nitrogen. So what we're gonna do, and I know I look good, but what we're gonna do is take 10 grams of coffee, poach it in liquid nitrogen, and then throw it straight into the grinder. We're gonna then take some frozen coffee from the freezer, grind it at the same grind setting, and then we'll take some room temperature coffee, grind at the same grind setting, and then we're gonna compare the grinds of each of those. So what I now have is 10 grams of room temperature coffee, freezer coffee, like domestic freezer, like -15 and -20 degrees Celsius, and then the liquid nitrogen coffee here. Now we could brew them, but I want to go deeper. There's toys here that we can play with, so we're gonna take these to a particle size analyzer and actually look at the difference between the grind distributions of these three coffees. Let's go do that. - This is a laser particle analyzer, and it tracks the distribution curve of our grounds that we'll be sampling today. We load our grounds into this over here, and when we close this, a vacuum will suck up all the grounds into this analyzer over here and it'll take readings and show a distribution curve on the screen over here. - We have our results. Now, what Hendon's papers suggested was that the colder you make the coffee beans before grinding, the finer the grinds would be and the more uniform the particle size would be. Did we get that result? Well, kind of, actually. What was interesting to me is that the room temperature coffee was really very similar to the kind of domestic freezer temperature. The kind of average particle size or the kind of peak particle size went from 670 microns down to, like, 664, which is a pretty minimal change, to say the least, and sort of surface area didn't change that much. But we did see a bigger change with the liquid nitrogen. That dropped down to 640, but when you look at the data, what you'll see is a real change in uniformity and in surface area as well, so it's definitely true. The colder you make the coffee, the finer its grinds, and sort of the more uniform it is. So we wanna do a taste test to kind of understand this whole thing a little bit more. So here's how it's gonna work. We're gonna brew three cups of each of the three temperatures of beans. So we'll brew a room temperature, we'll brew a freezer, and then we'll brew the liquid nitrogen-chilled beans again. To match the grind settings is tricky, and we've used the particle analyzer again to try and dial it in. So the difference is this. To get a matching particle size, if we grow the liquid nitrogen, frozen beans, at 6.5 on the EK, we're gonna be grinding the other two at 6, so like a half step finer to try and match the same sort of peaks as that super chilled frozen coffee bean result that we get. So we've brewed the three brews. Michael's mixed them up again for me, so I don't know which is which, which is interesting. The room temperature and the frozen brewed pretty identically in terms of drawdown time. The liquid nitrogen brew was actually very slightly slower, but not so much slower that it couldn't have been my fault for being slightly inconsistent. There was a maybe 10 second slower than the others. I wouldn't say it's super important or worth worrying about. I think, ultimately, these brewed very similarly. Can I detect a difference in taste? I may not be able to, but we'll see. This cup is, like, a little bit sweeter and cleaner. It's almost lighter, right? And that could be me having a little confirmation bias in that I think it might be the liquid nitrogen and therefore I think it might have a few less finds. I need to taste these some more. There's like a little extra harshness in these two cups that isn't as present in this one. It's kind of weird, it's a weird thing, because this one tastes almost less extracted. I feel like actually I would want to go find out on this one, whichever it is. It doesn't taste as extracted as these two, but it tastes lighter and cleaner and kind of more, kind of linear in a way, not in a bad way, but just, like, less attack on it. If I'm honest, I'm gonna pick this as I think this is the most uniform particle size, therefore I think it's the liquid nitrogen. These two, interestingly, and I expected a bigger difference between the freezer and the room temp, but actually, maybe I shouldn't. If we think about the data that we had before, they were surprisingly close in terms of particle distribution and kind of peak particle size. So these two, I think, are very similar in that way. I don't know which is which, so that's my guess. I guess we try and do a reveal and find out. This is B, therefore that's the freezer one there. This one says A. Good, that's A, so that is the room temperature. So that kinda makes sense. And this one, I'm gonna lift it up, even though I know what it says. That is the C, okay. What does this mean? 'Cause that's ultimately the question. Why run this experiment again? What are we trying to learn? How does this apply to you at home? I'm not saying you have to go and get a Dewar and get some liquid nitrogen and start freezing your coffee beans before you grind them, even though it's quite cool and huge fun. What I am saying is that I had previously been not a huge lover of grinding from frozen, but I think I've had that opinion challenged quite heavily here. I think there's no real downside to grinding from frozen. You know, we didn't see a big difference in particle distribution. I don't see a big difference in taste when you brew them. And that means if you like to freeze coffee to keep it longterm, 'cause freezers are super helpful for that, then you don't have to worry about defrosting or that kind of stuff. You know, I think there can be differences that are more pronounced with something like espresso, where small, small variances in particle size manifest in flow rate quite notably, but for brewed coffee, I think grinding from frozen is definitely okay. It's definitely good thing. And I think the liquid nitrogen is just cool, And I kinda want to breW that again a little finer, but that's the learning here. The paper was right. I agree. We've replicated Chris Hendon's work. That's what we got, and we learned a thing. I'm very grateful for Cometeer for hosting me here and indulging me in my ridiculousness.", "videoID": "hXad5XBRTcI"}, {"title": "Should you freeze coffee beans\uff1f", "text": "We're going to cut straight to the chase. Should you store your coffee in the freezer? Maybe, let's get into this in a little bit more detail. Talk about when it's good to use the freezer to store coffee, and really when it's not. To start with let's talk about why you might want to store your coffee in the freezer. Very cold temperatures are great at slowing certain kinds of reactions involved in things going stale. Freezer temperatures slow down oxidation, they prevent the loss of volatile aromatic compounds. They just generally slow at the staling process. Now, most domestic freezers don't go cold enough to completely stop that process. I think the research done by a sort of famed coffee scientist, engineer, roaster builder, Mike , said that you needed to store coffee at minus 40. That magical temperature where it doesn't matter what units you're talking about. Anyway, most domestic freezers live at about minus 20 degrees Celsius. That's good enough to help slow the process quite dramatically. Freezers, however, have a problem. They are incredibly dry places. And those kinds of temperatures, moisture can't stay in the air. It comes out of the air and forms ice crystals. If you've ever owned a freezer, you'll have seen that happen and you'll know that freezers need deicing. All of that ice, all of that buildup has come from the air. Now, how does that affect coffee? Well, in an ideal world, we could put coffee in our freezer and it would slow down the staling and that would be great. What we want to do, however, is really limit the interaction between the coffee beans that are now minus 20 degrees Celsius and any kind of air. What you don't want to do, is this. You don't want to go and buy a big Kilo bag and put the whole bag in the freezer, and then every morning get the bag out, get your coffee out, put the bag back in the freezer. Because all you're gonna do is introduce lots of fresh humid air into this beans. You're going to get crystallization of ice on that coffee. That's just bad in every single way possible. So here's your best practice. If you've bought a kilo of coffee, if you've bought a couple of pounds, three, five if you've bought more coffee than you need in the next week or two, then what you want to do is parcel it out into one to two week sort of quantities and freeze those. You want to get rid of as much air in whatever you're freezing in as possible, ideally. Now some people go as far as vacuum packing it, that's a little extreme and I'm a little uncomfortable with the amount of wastage that comes from that. There are certain things that require the vacuum packaging and I'm okay with that, but I think vacuum packaging coffee just the waste is a little bit ugh for me. But it is probably the best possible way to do it, but I wouldn't go so far as to vacuum seal individual portions unless you had a coffee that was incredibly expensive and you were running a very, very, very cold freezer. So, you've bought that kilo, you want to parcel it out to say 250 gram, 300 gram, 350 gram, whatever you prefer into those kinds of parcels. You can use freezer proved sort of Mason jars, if you want to do that. You could obviously use freezer bags if you want to. Those things are reusable and that thing is good, or you can just buy three or four individual normal sized retail bags and put all but one in the freezer. And then what you want to do is take out portion the night before you need it, do not open it and let it defrost overnight. That'll do fine just on the counter overnight. You don't want to open it when the beans are that cold cause you will get some condensation forming on them, and broadly speaking that's just not particularly good for coffee. You don't really want to do that. If you've just bought a regular sized retail bag it's just not worth you freezing that, it's not. Just use it over the next couple of weeks and you'll be completely fine. You're not going to do much to really change the state of that coffee. If the coffee is stale out of date to begin with there's no point freezing it, nothing good will happen there. Nothing bad will happen, but nothing good will happen, So why bother? In summary, if you've got more fresh roasted coffee than you need in the next couple of weeks, take the excess and portion it into one to two week portions, seal them air tight. Get rid of as much air as you can and freeze them. And then the night before you need a portion take it out of the freezer, let it defrost sealed on the counter. The next morning grind, drink, enjoy.

I don't know if a particularly good definition for it. I'll link to some stuff down below. When it comes to talking about your career often successful people don't really understand why they've succeeded, but they think they do. And they overvalue certain actions that they took that sort of fit their perception of themselves. A lot of people telling you why and how they succeeded, they don't really know. Now I wanna talk about my career and talk about some of the stuff I've learned so far, but I don't wanna talk about why I think things have gone well 'cause I don't really know but, I think we all know when we screw up. I think we all know when we make mistakes and I'm really interested in learning other people's hard lessons, the easy way. So today I thought I would share three mistakes that I have made in my career early on back when I worked for other people that may be helpful for you wherever you are in your career. First mistake. I did not really truly understand the gap between information, knowledge, and wisdom. I was a rabbit collector of information. I was frenzy at at times. I would buy any book any book on coffee that I could get my hands on. I would troll eBay and like A books and used books, sort of sellers online for anything that had coffee in the title. And I probably ended up with a library of close to 200 books at one point. And I read a lot of them. And I thought that this would give me an edge that this would give me you know, an advantage in my career. It made me really good at trivia games to do with coffee. And that was really it. I had collected enormous amounts of coffee trivia. It wasn't knowledge. I haven't converted the information into knowledge through practice. And it certainly wasn't wisdom, which comes with a function of using that knowledge over a period of time. It was just trivia. And I think it's easy to fall into that trap. And these days it may not be buying books but it may be just which videos you've watched who you follow on social media, what blog posts you read if people still wrote blog posts, let's pretend they do. It's the kind of collection of information without really the application of it where in real learning happens. And I got that wrong for a long, long, long time. I don't necessarily regret. A lot of the learning I did. I like, I think it really deepened my appreciation for coffee and the breadth and depth of coffee. It's sort of hooks me in a way that kept me in the industry a long time. But I think I massively overvalued that information 'cause I haven't really worked out how to make it useful. Second mistake. I liked empathy for my employer. Now, this sounds like a really weird thing, but go with me for just a second. In our careers early on in the middle, wherever we are, we have our career goals. And we will chase those down and we will apply ourselves through hard work and dedication to achieve those goals. And that's a good thing. I'm not saying that's a bad thing. That's a good thing, but, there's more than one pathway to achieving your goals. And I did not really think about the perspective of my employer often when I was chasing down my goals. This meant that there were often points of friction times where we butted heads where I felt I was just trying to do my job to the best of my ability and to pursue my goals. And that I was frustrated with them because they just played didn't understand that. They lacked empathy towards me but in truth, I lacked empathy towards them. Their challenges, their needs. And had I been a little bit smarter I could've chased down exactly the same goals in a slightly different way that would have worked much more in harmony with what they were after what they were trying to achieve too. I'm a little embarrassed looking back at the way I behaved how I acted, how I felt because it was in many ways incredibly selfish and inwardly focused. And that's just part of, I guess often being young, being naive. And I was so embarrassed, you know, I did at some point later on once I'd been an employer call my previous employer to apologize. I think I've talked about that before but this was really it. I just, lacked empathy and I could have achieved my goals in a way quicker way better way that would have been way more valuable to that employer to boot. A lesson learned. Number three. I massively overvalued technical coffee skills. Now the easiest examples of one of these is gonna be latte art, right? Like I thought latte art was really, really, really important. In truth, I attached way more value to it because it made me feel good. It's probably a separate discussion about latte art to be had outside of this video. But I would, you know value these right technical skills. Now the world of coffee has changed and is changing all the time. And certainly 10 years ago, if you were in a coffee business you were looking for people with coffee skills with technical coffee skills that were very useful at that time because they were somewhat rare. What I didn't value, were other skills outside of coffee. And I could have easily pursued other sort of skillsets alongside things I was learning in coffee, but I really just double down purely, purely on coffee. Now, by the time I started my own business I realized I had enormous shortfalls in what I knew in my education and my understanding around the world of coffee business. These days I speak to more and more people who are hiring and they don't just want pure coffee skillsets anymore. They want coffee plus something else. Be it marketing, be it finance, be it customer service. Be it anything really. Like the, there are more opportunities for you if you have a slightly broader skill set. I'm not saying don't learn about coffee, absolutely you learn about coffee and go as deep as you want to but, don't do it at the expense of learning additional skills. I think as the coffee world evolves those additional skills make you incredibly desirable. And you know, I regret perhaps being again a bit blinkered a little bit focused at that time. So there you go. There's three mistakes that I made pretty early on my career.", "videoID": "nBkKwT-1CaQ"}, {"title": "Supermarket Instant Coffee - Which One Tastes Best\uff1f", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about instant coffee. We're gonna taste, a lot of instant coffee and I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little bit nervous. More and more of you, you've been asking me to do a big taste test to tell you which is the best instant coffee. And to be honest, I was pretty reluctant to do that. I have pretty strong feelings against instant coffee and I'll tell you why. I spent the last 17 years of my coffee career trynna make coffee taste as good as possible and trynna do so in what I hope is an ethical way, that runs contrary to the targets and the goals and the aspirations of instant coffee. Instant coffee first and foremost wants to be convenient and convenience by a large results in a sacrifice of quality. But more than that, instant wants to be cheap. Now coffee is kind of incredible. The idea that there's some fruit, was grown in another country. It was picked, it was processed once after harvest processed again before export it was then imported and it was roasted and it was then ground and turned into a giant cup of coffee and then, dried down to a kind of weird powder and then packaged and then shipped and delivered to you and you can drink a cup of coffee for pennies. That's astonishing. But I'm not sure it's good, because those companies there's very large companies producing these products aren't sacrificing their profits along the way. But something has to give and by a large that's producers. These are enormous corporations who are very happy with the neo-colonial system that is coffee production. And I'm not really okay with that. Now there are in amongst the coffees we're gonna talk about today, some more ethical coffees than others, but broadly speaking instant hasn't been good for producers, I think. It's a very personal statement. But that's how I feel. But. I'm so curious, if I'm gonna have a bias against them. If I'm gonna dislike it, I probably should be informed and maybe actually something tastes good. Maybe one of the more ethical ones tastes good. That would be kind of okay, but I guess we should find out. So I went to a delivery website and I bought every instant coffee that they stocked which turned out to be 38 different products. Which is a lot more than I expected for some reason. Now the were, I think about another 12 decaf products available but I didn't pick those up this time. I felt 38 was enough. Instead of taking each coffee and dissecting it one by one I thought it would be more fun or entertaining I hope to do a giant tournament bracket. So here's what I did. I took a list of the coffees that I had and I generated a like a four digit alphanumeric string for each one to begin a kind of process of turning these into a blind tasting. I then entered those little codes into a tournament generating website and that's how things are gonna play out. So, I don't really know what I'm gonna be tasting but I'll make sure you know what's happening so that you can follow along. Now we got a slightly unusual number here so there's gonna be some three-way ties to start with before going ultimately head to head. And that's it. All of these have been weighed out, same amount of coffee in each one, same water in each one, same water temperature, water weight, all that kind of stuff. This is a pretty standardized testing. I'll test both. I'll pick a winner and very quickly, I'll tell you why. Before we get stuck in a quick note on what I'm looking for, what I think is good and what I think is bad. Easier to start with bad. I think bad is strong bitterness. I think bad is kind of woody, earthy or rubbery kind of flavors that are common in many cheaper instant coffees. Good would be relatively low on the bitterness end or low on the unpleasant bitterness end, a little bit of sweetness would be nice, tasting of somewhere would it be good, tasting fresh would be incredible. So that's roughly what I'm looking for. Is it harsh and Woody and bitter or does it have some redeeming qualities? Come myself my fancy spoon was important for tasting, not essential but nice. Your definitely out as the harshest and bitterest of them. This one is the least bad of the three. This is very harsh, very bitter, definitely out. This one is less better and tastes of somewhere. This one wins it's a bit odd. These two, just a little bit dominant on the bitter front not that interesting though this one probably better than that one. Not a lot going on on this one, to be honest, neither good nor bad it's kind of lawful neutral, this one bit harsh, bit Woody, this one less better which is good. Quite an unusual taste to it which would be a little bit more might for a lot of people, I like that it taste of something other than sort of harsh cheap coffee. Winner. This is very classic instant coffee profile to me, this I find the most unpleasant of the three by quite a long way. I don't really like any of these three. This one has a weird little kind of vanilla note in it that seems almost artificial but not. Very odd, unusual enough I guess to take the win from this round. Honestly, not a huge fan of anything here, too harsh, too bitter, some in here really harsh, bitter, Woody. This one moves forward on the grounds of being, the least bad of the three. This is the last of the three-way ties. We're gotta head to heads after this one. Pretty easy and conclusive win, for this particular coffee here, very harsh bitter don't like this one at all. This cup here actually very similar to this one here, harsh, Woody, earthy, rubbery. That is a clear cut winner. Now we're into the head to heads, should go a little bit quicker now. This is really weird, I don't know what's going on here but I'm really definitely not into the flavor profile, this I don't love this, but it's better than this one. Weird but interesting. This one's just a little bit more harsh and bitter. Here's my winner. Very harsh, bitter, quite earthy, not at all that quite a different cup of coffee, not bad definitely a winner. Not a big fan of either one. This one just harsher, more bitter. This one is kind of weird tasting. I'm not sure it's good, it's definitely interesting. You. Not a big fan of either one. This one loses out for being that little bit more harsh, more bitter than this one. This one has a sort of super fake chocolate oddness to it. This one just a little bit more harsh and bitter, I think this is the winner. Both super weird if I'm honest. Both of them tasted much lighter, I don't really like either of these but I'm gonna put new forwards. No. Also no. These are both to me quite harsh, extremely bitter, extremely Woody, I feel like we've knocked out better coffees, but this is gonna progress from this round. So this is better and it's quite chocolatey, it's quite surprising. This is chocolatey too but also a little odd and vegetabley and weird. So this one. Again, it's a difficult round I don't like either of these at all. This one I just enjoyed less, it was just flavor wise a bit mustier I guess than this one which was still pretty bitter. And so having tasted my way through now 38 different instant coffees. I'm not giving up fresh coffee. There's been some interesting stuff here. There's been a lot of stuff that tasted about what I expected it to taste like. Let's not get stuck on this right now. Let's keep going. Let's find the best one. So let's crack through these 16, get them down to eight. This one's just a little mustier, mushroomier. This one will be the winner. These are the super interesting compared to most of the other ones here. They taste a little bit weaker, they're a little bit less intense tasting. This one is just weird. I remember one of them is an Ethiopian coffee and I figured maybe it's this one. It has a lot of floral qualities to it that are quite unusual. They don't taste how I expect most Ethiopian coffees to taste but it definitely tastes complex and quite surprising. This I think it's just more enjoyable. This one, I think is just a nicer tasting cup of coffee. Again, both kind of weird in the same sort of way. This one's a little almost Tangeriney in a way that I feel weird saying out loud. I don't really like either. I think this one's my winner. Just. This one is quite vegetable in comparison to this one. I don't particularly like this one either, I feel like we've knocked better things out, but it is the better of the two. This one is super chocolatey, quite a pleasant way in comparison to this one. This is a bit more of a classic instant profile. This one's a clear winner. I would say this one is just a touch more interesting, I don't love it but it is a bit more interesting than this one. It's that chocolate profile back again. This is, almost a little bit more interesting but the kind of chocolatiness of this I think kinda wins out in this round. Easy and clear win, this one I just don't like it It's very classic, harsh, Woody, earthy, bitter, not really good. This is lighter, brighter, friendlier. This is the winner. Now before we hone in on the final winner, there's a couple of things I want to talk about. Firstly, this video has a giveaway.

I still don't know any of these coffees, who made them, where they're from, any of that stuff but we're gonna get to the end soon. So we've got eight coffees still standing. Let's get that down to one as quickly as we can. Easy win, this one is just much more pleasant tasting this one's still, like a little bit vegetabley now it's cooling down a bit more. This one still has this weird fake quality to it that I can't get over, but it is less bitter than this one here. I'm weirded out by how this one tastes. It's the chocolatey one again with a little bit of ashtray in the end? I think more people would find this approachable and pleasant than this one. I'm not in love with either. This one is another chocolatey one again, it's turning a little bit for me now. This one is just a little bit cleaner in comparison actually a little bit less, bitter I think. So it's the winner. So into the semifinals now. This One is my winner again, it's just a more pleasant cup of coffee in comparison. If you like a special milk in your coffee this is probably gonna be better than this one here, but from a coffee flavor perspective, Oh it's tough. This one just might edge it out a little bit. But it's close just know that this one was close. And that leaves us with a head to head. Who will be the winner. It's difficult. They're both actually quite a similar profile in some ways, I would say this one edges it out a little bit, it's just slightly more complex than this one but your preference may be different to mine. I know I've just picked a winner and I don't know what it is yet. It's code N-four-one-P I don't know what that means yet I have to look it up. Has probably been consistently the more interesting of the coffees through this particular process. It's definitely on the lighter side in terms of roast than a lot of the other coffees that we tasted and it doesn't have the kind of characteristic woody, earthy qualities of Robusta in there. It tastes like it started as a pure Arabica coffee. So for me, that's been the winner. Let's find out what it is and go and get it. And so it was this, this was our winner. Little's Colombian Premium Instant Coffee. It is from Antioquia in Columbia, clean acidity and nice sweetness is their description, for an instant that's not far wrong. And if I'm honest I'm pleased to see a small UK manufacturer doing well in the space. Now I do stand by my comment earlier on, which is instant is a little snapshot of coffee but it is not the full picture. Fresh ground coffee would destroy everything here and I can't emphasize that enough the difference is night and day.", "videoID": "8cIqLvJz8VM"}, {"title": "Recipe\uff1a A Coffee Amaro (In 30 Minutes)", "text": "Today we're gonna make a coffee amaro.

Now we're gonna break all the rules around making amaros. These things often take weeks, if not months to infuse 'cause you're gonna take some sort of booze and infuse into them botanicals. Could be roots, herbs, could be spices. It doesn't really matter, it's a kind of regional thing. Here we're gonna show you a technique that you can get it done start to finish in 30 minutes if you want to. Though I will say taking a little bit more time at certain stages will benefit the end results. So once again, if people doing things the non-traditional way really upsets you, look away now. So we're gonna break this recipe into a few little stages, and the first stage is to get the coffee flavor into the booze. Now, today I'm gonna be using some whiskey, some bourbon whiskey. Now I like it 'cause it's clean and it's sweet, and it's not terribly expensive to have it taste pretty good. Now I would say don't spend too much money on this because it's a waste of money to really buy something lovely for this, just drink it. But something like Maker's, something like Buffalo Trace maybe. Good, free of defect, enjoyable to drink, but don't get fancy. We're gonna start with 200 grams of whiskey and there are gonna be losses along the way. And at the end of all of this, we might end up with between 140 to 150 grams of finished amaro. So just know that going in. What we're gonna use for our infusion is this, which is a cream whipper. Now a cream whipper is obviously fine for whipping cream but they are great for infusing things with flavor. So we're gonna add whiskey to this, and then we're gonna grind 40 grams of coffee to match the 200 grams of whiskey. We're gonna grind it pretty fine, very close to espresso. Something that would pull a disturbingly fast espresso shot, but still kind of very fine feeling. So it feels pretty close to espresso. Now I'm just gonna use this V60 here just as a funnel 'cause I didn't have a better funnel to hand. And then to that, 200 grams. Now we're not gonna shake this but we are gonna give it a good swirl together to combine. And what we'll do is then add a nitrous charge to it which is not the soda ones, you want the cream whipper ones. Lovely. So we've pressurized this now. And actually that gas is gonna start dissolving into the liquid below a little bit. And we're gonna leave this to infuse for about five minutes. Now usually I don't like extractions done at room temperature, I don't like things like cold brew. But we're not brewing with water here, we're brewing with alcohol too. It will extract certain flavors that water can't, and that's really useful. Now you will get a little bit more bitterness, but we'll fix that in the next step. Now at four minutes when you release the pressure, don't be gentle. Be aggressive, let it all out very quickly that will be very disruptive to the ground coffee and help with extraction. You can hear that fizzing. So now we're gonna filter it, and we're just gonna pour it through a simple sieve. It won't do a perfect job, but don't worry about that. You are gonna lose some of the whiskey to the ground coffee, there's nothing we can do about it. And let's just throw this away. So this liquid here, well it tastes pretty bad. It's incredibly bitter, but it's got tons, and tons, and tons of flavor. What we're gonna do now is a lovely technique called milk washing. What we need for that is about 55 grams of whole milk. Now I'll warn you now, this technique is a little bit disgusting to some people. What's gonna happen is we're going to add the alcohol to the milk and stir as we do, and it's gonna cause the milk to break, and curdle, and trapped in those kind of curds, 'cause that's what they are. Is gonna to be a lot of the stuff that we don't want anymore. So what we're gonna do is stir this and then add the coffee booze. What we can see, is a curdling effect, which is disgusting but entirely wonderful in terms of end result. If we go over that 30 minute amaro, you're gonna move straight to the next step. But the longer you leave this now sort of settling out, the cleaner and clearer the end product will be. Now I'm mostly interested in this from a taste perspective not a visuals perspective, so I'm happy to proceed straight away but at the very least, you're gonna need to wash out your cream whipper, clean out your sieve, because you're gonna need those things again in a second along with whatever you strained into, I'm gonna use my V60 carafe again. Okay, so now we are gonna use paper. So you're gonna put this together to filter again, but you're gonna keep the sieve as well. So we're gonna do a two stage filtration of the curds, so to speak. So what we've got in here is this kind of awkward coffee cheese that we don't want. We don't want this at all. And then below it now we've got the last few bits kind of being filtered out. Now, if you're like me, you have just no patience whatsoever, you can speed this up a little bit. If you pinch all of these filter pieces together carefully. Just sort of seal off the top. You can twist that top very gently. Now, the harder you squeeze, essentially the less clear the liquid you're gonna get is gonna be. I'm okay with a little squeeze. If you squeeze too hard, you'll just tear the filter paper and that would be bad, and a mess, and you'd have to start over again which you don't wanna do. But just gently twisting to apply a pressure does help speed up this clarification process a little. So we've got our pretty clarified coffee liquid now, tons of coffee flavor in there. Tons of bourbon flavor too. But it has been diluted slightly by that milk wash. So essentially we've added some water, a little bit of sugar, actually, some of the lactose from the milk will be in here, so it's very slightly sweeter. So what we'll do now though, is infuse more flavors in there and we'll use the same technique that we did before. So we get our cream whipper. We're gonna add our liquid. We've got about 150 grams here. To that, we're gonna add a few very classic flavors. Firstly, we're gonna add some dried bitter orange peel. We're gonna add a gram and a half of that. You all recognize that smell, that flavor from things like Campari, or other kinda citrusy things. Next we're gonna add some gentian root. This is very common in a lot of amaros, it adds a bit of bitterness. It's actually been proven to help with dyspepsia, indigestion, and that kinda stuff. Next we're gonna add just one allspice berry that we'll crush. Lovely. In you go. And next up is actually something a little bit different. This is actually a Vietnamese cassia bark. It's not true cinnamon, it's cassia, a relation that smells very similar. But this is incredibly aromatic, like incredibly aromatic. You could use a regular cinnamon powder here but I'm gonna grate some of this, about half a gram. It has that really lovely, very pretty aromatic quality, and a little bit of that almost heat that you get from good cinnamon. And then also a little half gram of good nutmeg. Just very pretty, ah, lovely. Next up, we're gonna add about half a gram of minced Madagascan vanilla. So everything is in here now, let's put it together, and then we'll charge it once, give it a good shake, and then discharge it very aggressively. And then charge it again, and wait for five minutes. One more charge. And now just five more minutes of waiting. Now while that infuses, you can get on and prep the last few bits and pieces for this drink. You're gonna need a demerara syrup. Now you can make this ahead of time. It's two parts light brown sugar to one part water, heat it up just until it dissolves and then cool it down. So we've got some of that ready. Adds a lovely kind of caramel quality to the final drink, works really well with that coffee flavor that's in there. You're gonna need an orange for garnish, and potentially just a little splash of clean water. That's kind of up to you. You might wanna just dilute it down a little bit, just if you prefer to drink it quickly or you don't like too much booze in your amaro. I'm gonna add a very small amount of water just to dilute it a little bit down. So you need some of that ready too. And then our friend saline solution. We've talked about this in the past, 80 20, that's 20 salt, 80 water, very useful for any kind of cocktail drink. Now I know I've given you lots of data, lots of information. This recipe has been written up, it's been written up on my website, a website that I built with this video's sponsor, which is Squarespace.

Thank you so much to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So infusion done, and again a rapid discharge is always a good thing of pressure. And then we're gonna do one final filtration through paper but we're gonna lose a few more grounds of this sadly, but we don't want any pieces of spice floating around our drink. And again, give that little soft twist and squeeze just to get maximum yield out. We just wanna get rid of those big pieces of spices. So to this, we're gonna add our sugar. We're gonna add 60 grams. Again, if you make this and don't like the sweetness, you can tweak it. This is just the kind of sweetness that I really enjoy in an amaro. And I'm gonna add what seems like a tiny amount of water, but just 25 grams. And we're done, and we can bottle it now. Now there's a reason this isn't a full bottle. You wanna make what you're gonna use reasonably quickly because this has coffee in it, and I think coffee degrades quite badly over time. I prefer to drink this fresh. I would keep it in the fridge, not the freezer. It will pretty much freeze solid in a very cold freezer. So it's not hugely boozy. It's probably about 20% alcohol at this point. So when it's time to drink it, get yourself a beautiful cube of ice. You're gonna then pour on your measure of coffee amaro. And don't forget to add a couple drops of saline to this. Give it a gentle stir. And then garnish with just a little piece of orange zest. Oh that smells good. That fresh orange hit is really nice, but you can get a little bit more of that coffee and that bitter orange coming through. That is, I think a really lovely drink. The coffee's there, it's playing a role but it's not the star of the show, and that's what I want. You can taste the bourbon, that comes through really nicely. You can taste the coffee. But you could give this to someone who doesn't like coffee, who does like amaros, I think they'd really like it. And you get that orange and that bitter orange in there too. And the gentian provides a really distinct and pleasant bitterness. But in the middle there is this wonderful, aromatic component of those spices. That cassia, the nutmeg, the all spice, they just play beautifully together. Now you could do this a whole bunch of different ways. You could adapt this base technique with a bunch of different spices if you'd like that, a bunch of different herbs if you like that. You could start with a different raw material, you could just do this with vodka or something else if you wanted to. There's no rules outside of Italy anyway. So if you do this, let me know what you tried. Let me know if you made some alterations. You could drink this with just a splash of tonic and it would be very good. You could drink this just neat, and chilled, and it would be very good.", "videoID": "4LO8IpK3C3U"}, {"title": "Syrian Espresso Culture in Turkey", "text": "This is Aksaray, a neighbourhood in Istanbul dubbed as Little Syria. It is the one area where you can find anything from Syrian bread, to Syrian spices, to espresso. And espresso here will set you back only 30 cents. And Aksaray is not alone. Right now you can find an espresso machine on almost every street in areas with significant Syrian populations. These espresso machines are not usually inside coffee shops but are directly on the streets, sometimes even in front of small shops or markets. But the most interesting part is that this culture didn't exist just a couple of years ago. Although Turkey has the second most Starbucks shops among European countries, and the cafe culture is extremely popular, Turkey doesn't really have a strong espresso culture. Drinking espresso without mixing it with anything is still kind of a niche thing. Now you might be thinking that, \"Oh, the Syrians brought espresso culture to Turkey.\" but that's not true, at least not entirely. - I don't remember I have ever seen an espresso machine in my village. I mean, you can find it maybe in like Old Damascus areas, or like Old Aleppo, and that happened very lately, actually. You can find it in cafes, for example, which is normal I think but it wasn't that popular. - And the explanation is that this culture was not brought into Turkey but it was was born in Turkey. To understand why, and how this culture was born, we have to look into two things: history, and the refugee crisis. Most of you have probably heard about the origin story of coffee. The one with the Ethiopian goat herder, very excited goats, and the monk who disapproved and then changed his mind after smelling burnt coffee. Although we don't have much, if any, evidence to support this story, we know that coffee as a drink existed back in the 15th century. Until the mid 17th century, it was drunk exclusively by the Muslims. By 1534 it had reached Damascus and 20 years after that it had reached the Ottoman Empire's capital, Istanbul. Two Syrians, one from Damascus named Hakam, and the other one from Aleppo, named Shem, moved to the capital and opened the first coffee shops there. These shops were very successful and had laid the foundations of the coffee culture in Turkey, helping create what we call as Turkish coffee today. Although Syrians helped blooming the Turkish coffee culture, Syrian coffee and Turkish coffee are two very different drinks. Although there are more subtleties, this is where most of the differences end and the similarities begin. Both coffees are made using similar methods. You start with adding water to your cezve, then you add coffee to your cezve, you mix them together, you start heating them on a fire, or nowadays on a stovetop, and then when it boils, your coffee is ready. This whole process takes somewhere between 3 to 10 minutes and is usually enjoyed sitting and sipping with friends or family. It was traditionally drunk in coffee shops or served to guests. It's definitely a social drink, which makes sense given it's also called the wine of Islam. There is also another traditional Syrian coffee drink called M\u0131rra. And it's even more ritualistic in its nature. M\u0131rra is usually boiled for somewhere between two to seven hours. After that, it's usually put in a cezve that's being warmed by some coals in it. You can think of the cezve as something like an Ember mug but it's a lot more basic and a lot larger. M\u0131rra is also traditionally drunk at homes, usually offered to guests, family, or friends. Although this was an oversimplified summary of the origins of the coffee, the history of the Syrian coffee, and the culture surrounding it, it should be enough to prepare you for what comes next. In 2010, a spark in Tunisia has changed the future of a whole geography. What started as protests quickly turned into uprisings in many countries. In the case of Syria, it became a fully-fledged civil war. Many people fleeing from the horrors of the war took refuge in neighboring countries. Among these countries, Turkey saw the biggest influx of refugees. Between 2014 and 2016 the number of registered Syrian refugees rose by two million, which amounted to almost 10% of Syria's population before the war. And this was only the registered numbers. More than two million of these refugees live in only five cities: in Gaziantep, Hatay, and Urfa, the Syrian refugees make up more than 1/5 of the cities' populations. This influx of refugees has led to the creation of many Syrian ghettos. These ghettos are usually extremely crowded and very chaotic. The absence of infrastructure, the population density, and the overall bad administration all play a role in creating this very chaotic environment. The lack of local services and integration centers also further increases the social exclusion. Most of the businesses in these areas are owned by Syrians, meaning that day-to-day monetary transactions happen inside the Syrian community. As Syrians moved to Turkey, they brought their own culture with them. And in the Syrian culture, coffee has a very important place. - Well, Syrians drink coffee mostly every day. For Syrians, it's so related to the culture. You know, like I'm sure that every Syrian around the world has a lot of memories, a lot, a lot of memories, that's related to the smell of coffee. From waking up in the morning, your dad is making boiled coffee, the grandfather making M\u0131rra coffee, he wakes up at 5 am roasting manually the coffee and grinding it and then cooking it for hours. They use it in weddings, they use it in funerals, friend gatherings, all the time, everywhere you will find one liter of M\u0131rra coffee on the table, to be served for anyone, anytime. - In 2012, one of the biggest Syrian coffee chains, Hac\u0131 Olabi, entered the Turkish market. Although they operate two coffee shops in Istanbul, their main business is importing and roasting coffee. They sell their whole bean coffee to more than 50 coffee shops and they also sell ground coffee to make Syrian coffee at home. Although Hac\u0131 Olabi and other smaller coffee shops offer Syrian coffee for very low prices, it doesn't exactly fulfill the need for coffee for the refugees. The population density caused many people to live in very crowded houses. It's not rare to see ten people living together in a very small apartment. That's the reason that most refugees spend their days outside of their homes, usually working or running errands like dealing with the Turkish bureaucracy, or even sometimes shopping. In a lifestyle like this, waiting for boiled coffee is a luxury of time. This is where espresso comes in. It takes no more than 30 seconds to pull a shot. Most of the Syrians coming to Turkey left all their belongings and life savings behind in Syria and came to Turkey with very low amounts of money. A secondhand espresso machine usually doesn't cost too much. And you can sell it for almost the same price that you bought it for, making it a very low risk but kind of low-profit investment. Compare that to opening a restaurant or a shop, which requires a lot more risk-taking but is a bit more profitable. But that risk is usually too much for a refugee, and even for some refugees who took that risk, putting an espresso machine in front of their shops is a good investment because it's a steady income with low risk. That's the business side of the things, but another interesting aspect of this culture is the coffee itself. The espressos Syrians make are very different than the ones we are used to. Yes, that's instant coffee. Most espressos here are not tamped, so the extraction is very uneven and the body is very weak. So to balance this out, people put instant coffee into their espressos, and as weird as it might look, it kind of sort of... works? It gives a bit more body and makes it more like... coffee? And some people put lots and lots of sugar and milk powder into their espressos. I mean, a lot. Your personal taste probably plays the biggest role in shaping the way you drink your coffee. But something else also plays a very major role, and that is the culture you are surrounded in and your lifestyle. The Syrian coffee culture has a history of hundreds and hundreds of years that goes hand in hand with the overall general Syrian culture. But that culture was disrupted by the civil war and the following refugee crisis. But as life got faster, coffee also got faster. In fact, the fastest two ways of making coffee that I can think of are espresso and instant coffee. Similarly, as economic situations worsened, people came up with ways of making cheaper coffee. But the one thing that fascinates me the most about this whole new unique espresso culture is simply the fact that people just didn't give up on their coffee.", "videoID": "qDfLAS57_sU"}, {"title": "A Beginners Guide to Coffee Tasting", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about how to taste coffee, how to break apart those sensations of taste, to understand what it is you like, what you don't like, and to begin to learn to describe what it is that we're tasting. Now, this is a sort of second part, and the first part was how to set up a simple cupping at home. If you haven't watched that video yet, go and watch that video because setting up some sort of comparative tasting is absolutely essential to be able to develop your sense of taste and really progress quite quickly. Here, I've got two different coffees. That's enough, but having three or four or five would be even better. Now, today's video is gonna be a lot of talking. I'm gonna have to talk through a bunch of different taste characteristics. There's gonna be a bunch of opinion in there too. But it's not a very practical video. I'm gonna taste some coffee, but I'm mostly, I'm gonna talk to you. So the first thing I want you to do is check the description of this video. The first link is a link to a PDF, and that's a PDF that is a kind of cupping form that I think is really helpful. Now, this form was developed by Sara Larsson at Prufrock Training, with a little help from Evelina at Prufrock, and a tiny little bit of help from me too. There are loads of different cupping forms in our industry, but lots of them are focused on really specific things that aren't particularly relevant to what we're doing here. You can look at, say, the Cup of Excellence Cupping Form that is a complicated sheet that's really designed to help you rank an enormous number of raw coffees. A roaster may have a different form that they use to assess their roasts because they're not really looking at the raw coffee anymore. They're looking at the success of the roast. Here, this is a guide to help us sort of take notes and record what we like, what we don't, to be understand whether we like a coffee in front of us or whether we dislike it, what it is that we like, what it is that we don't like. They can help us choose better in the future, buy coffee better in the future, communicate with others what we like and what we don't like, and it's fun to develop your sense of taste. So what I'm gonna do is guide you through each of the sections, each of the categories of taste on the score sheet, and the first one is aroma, smell. How good does this coffee smell? Now, it's not really a key part of tasting, but it is a part of why we love coffee. When you grind a coffee, when you brew a coffee, there'll be a whole host of aromas that are delightful. Now, one of the key things about this sheet is the use of two individual scales, one for intensity and one for quality. You can have a coffee that smells incredibly strong and smells fantastic that would score high on both fronts. You can have a coffee that doesn't smell that intense, but it does smell pleasant. Or you could have something that smells intensely awful. You'd wanna be able to record that on two different scales, so that's why it's like that. A lot of coffee sheets just use one scale that I find a little bit confusing. Am I supposed to rate intensity or quality? Here, you've got two scales. Use them both. Now, aroma isn't the most important thing, but it is a huge part of why coffee's enjoyable. And if there are specific aromas that you catch, it's a good place to note them down. But don't worry too much if you can't put your finger on an exact aroma. Let's talk about acidity. Acidity is, by far, the most complicated, controversial, difficult, problematic aspect of coffee. Coffee professionals love acidity in coffee. And it happens for a whole host of reasons, and often it ends up being a little bit of a disconnect between them and a wider audience who maybe finds the idea of sour coffee to be unpleasant. Now, acidity is just one of the best parts of the food that we eat and drink. It provides that kind of freshness, that crispness to fruit. It gives that beautiful contrast to rich fattiness. It's a wonderful thing, but we don't think about it that much most of the time. Now, you'll perceive acidity around the sort of sides of your tongue. It's actually detected all over your tongue, but you sort of feel it along the sides there. And in coffee, it can be a really good thing, or it can sometimes be a really bad thing because acidity, well, in English we have two words for it. We have acidity, and we have sourness. And sourness has a kind of negative connotation. Acidity can be bad. Not many people enjoying drinking lemon juice. It's too sour. It's too acidic. But lemonade's fantastic. A good sort of fresh, crisp green apple is fantastic acidity. If you like sour candy, you love acidity. It's a wonderful thing. But you want it to be a positive acidity, a fresh acidity. You want it to feel bright and crisp and fresh and not harsh and sour. So when you're assessing acidity, the easiest way to do that is back to comparative tasting. Does coffee A feel more acidic than coffee B? Right, just a quantity assessment first. And then secondly, well, which acidity do I enjoy more? Which one feels nicer? Which one leaves my tongue feeling good? Which one maybe leaves it feeling a little sort of dried out? Which one's making me salivate? These are kind of nice ways to begin to assess acidity. One quick note, there is quite a common phenomenon in the general population which is called bitter-sour confusion where a lot of people, especially when tasting sour coffee, will describe it as bitter because it's unusual to most people to describe a coffee as sour. So sour bitter-confusion is pretty normal. Again, if you're perceiving it strongly down the sides of the tongue, if it's causing a little bit of salivation, it's likely to be acidity. Now, I have come across sour-bitter confusion quite a lot in my professional life. Typically it happens somewhere like a restaurant where a diner will send back an espresso for being too bitter. And that shot was definitely not over-extracted. The machine is nice and clean. The roast is not dark. How is that a bitter shot? You kinda tear your hair out. Chances are it was just a very sour shot, and there's bitter-sour confusion at play, and that's the language that someone will reach for to describe what they don't like. Let's talk about sweetness. Now, generally in our day-to-day lives when we talk about sweetness, we're probably referring to a simple sugar or a sweetener designed to replicate the sweetness of a simple sugar, something like sucrose, which is table sugar, or fructose found in fruit, that kind of very obvious, very sweet sweetness. Now, there is no simple sugar in coffee. Coffee is not naturally sweet in that way at any point. You can tell this because if you take a cup of coffee and you add even the tiniest amount of just table sugar to it, you can immediately tell that coffee is sweet in a whole other way. So here when we talk about sweetness in coffee, it's actually a much more complicated, more complex kind of definition of sweetness. You know what sweetness tastes like. I know what sweetness tastes like. And so for many people when they taste coffee for the first time, they're like, \"Well, that's not at all sweet.\" But sweetness in coffee tends to be this kind of slightly complicated composite of a whole host of different things. Acidity can add to sweetness in a funny sort of way. It can highlight that. It'll be about the kind of flavors and aromas that the coffee conjures. It'll be also about the kind of texture that the coffee gives. Sweetness generally comes from ripe fruit when the coffee was grown and harvested. It comes from good processing and good roasting and ideally good brewing as well. So there's no doubt that some coffees definitely feel sweeter than others, but don't go looking for a traditional obvious sweetness. It's a different kind of thing, and it is much harder to quantify. But as you go back and forwards between coffees and you think about them, which one feels sweeter to you? Which one feels more complex, more whole? So the next key characteristic of coffee that I want you to assess is body, right? And this is a kind of funny word. We could use texture or mouthfeel. None of them are fantastic. And it's a really key characteristic of coffee that I feel is not really been embraced by the kind of modern specialty coffee movement. It feels like a classic kind of second wave thing to talk about texture, whereas we really just wanna talk about flavor. But the texture, the mouthfeel, the body of a coffee, how it feels in your mouth is so important. You obviously could tell the difference between skim milk and whole milk, right? There's a huge textural difference there. One feels thin. One feels rich and full. That's the kind of thing I want you to think about here. Is this coffee light and almost like tea, or is it kind of heavy and full and rich and almost chewy? It's a very nice point to compare two different coffees. Which one feels bigger, richer, fuller? Now, you can have coffees that have a lot of mouthfeel, but you may not like that mouthfeel. At the most extreme end, robusta is a species that if you taste that, that will have a ton of body and texture, but it's not a particularly enjoyable one, to me anyway. Some people certainly like it more than I do, and that's okay. But it's certainly one to consider. Now, when it comes to assessing the sort of texture or the mouthfeel of a coffee, it's where I actually really prefer to use cupping as a brew method. If you, say, use a paper filter, that tends to sort of homogenize mouthfeel in quite a frustrating way. It's much harder to sort of discern between small differences in mouthfeel with paper-filtered coffee. With a cupping where there's no filtration, light, delicate coffees still feel very light and delicate. Heavier, richer, fuller coffees definitely feel that way too so that's why I'm a big fan of the cupping method to help develop language around coffee tasting. So the last category to talk about in this section is finish, and that's really what are you left with after swallowing that coffee, right? Does that feel good? Does that feel bad? Is it a harsh, unpleasant finish? Do a whole bunch of pleasant flavors slowly develop and sort of build over time? What are you left with? Is it a nice taste or a bad taste? Do you like the aftertaste or not, right? Some coffees will almost disappear, right? You'll swallow, and you'll be left with really kind of nothing there. That would be scoring low on both quantity and, for me, on quality as well. There might a brief finish, where it's lovely for a second but then goes away. It's quite a tricky thing to do if you're tasting multiple coffees. It needs a little bit of patience because you constantly wanna go back and compare and contrast. So take your time here. You can taste coffees all the way down until they're pretty much room temperature, so there's no rush here. You've got at least 30 minutes to do so. But don't keep bouncing backwards and forwards when you wanna score this. Taste it, let it sit 30 seconds, a minute, and really decide how you feel. There's one more category left that I wanna talk about, which is flavor, but before that, I just need to tell you about this video's sponsor. Skillshare is an online community full of thousands of classes covering all sorts of different entrepreneurial and creative skills. Now, I'm a Skillshare Premium member, which costs me $10 a month, and it means I have unlimited access to all of the classes they have to offer. For me, that's hugely useful. I wanna learn about things that are relevant to my career, relevant to YouTube, to making better videos, and there's tons of information on filmmaking on there. At the same time, there's lots of other things that really just interest me that are just fun to learn about. I love being able to dip in to, say, a quick knife skills class and pick up one or two things to take into my everyday cooking. I think Skillshare is incredibly affordable, but if you wanna try it out, then use the link in my description down below. You can get two months of free Skillshare Premium, unlimited access to all the courses that they offer. Imagine what new skills you could acquire in the next 60 days. Now, flavor is undeniably the category that gets people the most excited because being able to accurately describe the flavors of coffee makes you feel like a pro. The description of flavor amongst professionals can easily get frustratingly competitive. People are trying to call out the most specific descriptor they can, and I don't think that's particularly helpful. I would say that there's a few key kind of groups of flavors that are worth paying attention to that will help you understand what you like and what you don't like. Now, there are flavor wheels out there to help you narrow down your descriptors to something quite precise, but I don't want you to feel like you have to use a precise descriptor for it to be accurate. I get quite frustrated by our industry's obsession with very specific descriptors that are reliant on whoever's tasting that coffee having the same water brewing the same way from the same batch that they tasted. Coffee is a moving target, and I think very specific descriptors are probably intimidating to some people, frustrating to others, pretentious to others still. So let's just talk about some broad characteristics. So let's talk about kind of the fruity category of flavor descriptors that people use. Now, this is just a personal theory thing, but I would say there are, broadly speaking, three categories of kind of fruit descriptors that you'll see in coffee. At one end, you might see those kind of fresh fruit descriptors that cover things like berries, things like stone fruits, things like apples or pears, and then in the middle you might have what I might call the kind of cooked fruit characteristics, things that are jammy, things that are like kind of baked, kind of pies, all that kind of stuff. You'll see people refer to sort of cooked fruits sometimes. And then on the other end, there are those kind of tropical, through to kind of fermented fruit flavors that are really quite different to all of the others that we've talked about beforehand. For me, these are kind of tied to acidity. If you have a sort of medium to high level of acidity in a coffee, you're probably gonna wanna start hunting round for a fresh fruit descriptor. That's the time in the real world where we get high sweetness, high acidity, is in fresh fruits, and that's what your brain is probably thinking about something in that category. Is it berry-like? Is it grape-like? Is it kind of appley and fresh and crisp that way? Or is it maybe more like a plum or a peach or something, that kind of sweet/acidic combo there? If the coffee has a little bit lower acidity, them, yeah, I would generally look for more of a kind of cooked fruit descriptor. I think those are really helpful sometimes. Generally when you cook fruits down, you do diminish their acidity, which is why if you're getting that kind of aroma and flavor of fruit, but you wanna describe it well, I think cooked fruits are a good place to go. On the other end, you've then got categories like kind of tropical fruits or sort of slightly fermented wild kind of things there. It can cover things like strawberries, even though that really should sit right in this end, but that kind of aroma of strawberries is often common in things like naturally processed coffees. Or you might have coffees that have had a much longer fermentation that's kind of skirted things getting a little too wild, and you might use descriptors like mango or pineapple for those kind of coffees. Generally speaking, this category of flavor is a little bit of a love-hate thing with both consumers and professionals. Some people really love naturally processed coffees that have these kind of characteristics. Some people really, really, really hate them. Now, there is one category of flavor that if I was being fancy I would call the kind of Maillard and caramelization family of flavors. If I'm being less fancy, I would say it's the things that have gone brown and are now delicious category. This would include things like kind of caramels or chocolate or toast or biscuits or things that have got baked, things that have been roasted in a delicious and kind of sweet way. Coffee undergoes a whole host of very similar reactions to other things that are roasted or baked, and so using those kind of words, I think, are very good descriptions of coffee. Typically, you might wanna be trying to describe the particular kind of sweetness that a coffee has, right? Is it more like a kind of maple syrup? Is it more like a caramel? Is it more like a toffee? Do people know the difference between toffee and caramel anyway? Who knows? I don't want you to be really specific in this stuff. It isn't helpful because you'll end up chasing a thing. If one specific word pops into the back of your brain, write it down, keep it, grab it. It's really useful when that happens. But don't feel you have to get that specific for every single thing. Now, it's perfectly acceptable to write down descriptors for things that you don't like here as well. If there is a bitterness if you don't like, if there is a burntness that you don't like, if there's a kind of rubbery flavor that you don't like, if it tastes like earth or wood or mushrooms or vinegar or just something unpleasant, it's okay to pay attention to the things that you don't like as much as the things that you do like. Now, on this little score sheet, there is at the end a place for a score. Now, I'm not a huge fan of scores in general, but it is a nice place to kinda summarize how you feel about a particular coffee, right? Just give it an emotional score. I think that's okay. In coffee, we score in a much more structured way where there's lots of different categories contribute scores to a final score. Those are useful for some people. They're a little problematic for others. Here, I just want you to have somewhere to make a note of your favorites, for the things you didn't really care for, and for the things in between. So I did just wanna touch on one final characteristic that isn't really discussed in typical coffee tastings or coffee scoring sheets. That's bitterness. Now, as an industry, we're not very comfortable talking about bitterness because to us, bitterness is failure. We think that one of the key sort of selling points of a specialty coffee is that it is much, much, much less bitter than commodity coffee, than commercial coffee. But there's still some bitterness there, right? There are undeniably bitter compounds in every single cup of coffee, and it's okay if you wanna talk about that. It's okay if you like that. For us, bitterness is kind of a failure. It's a failure of roasting. It's a failure of brewing. We don't really wanna talk about, even if you like it. And I'll be honest, it's true for me. If I'm doing a public tasting, I really won't talk about bitterness until someone raises the question. But it's okay if you like it. It's okay if you wanna take notes about it. I just wanted to explain why as an industry we don't really talk about it. So go. Go and taste. Go and compare and contrast. Take a bunch of notes. Don't settle on anything until you've had a chance to taste it right the way down until it's cool.", "videoID": "kEZZCQTSSAg"}, {"title": "Weird Coffee Science - High Humidity Coffee Storage", "text": "Welcome to another episode of weird coffee science, and weird, today's episode is. This one might be a head-scratcher. Now, from time to time, I get messages, emails, ideas from you, the viewer, and this is one of those. Someone called Hammad, he's a viewer as well as a Patreon supporter, so thank you, sent me through an idea. He suggested that storing coffee in a high humidity environment might be a good thing. And I thought that was a bad idea. I did not understand what he was talking about. We know that moisture is bad for storing coffee but he came with a paper showing that storing in high humidity conditions can prevent oxidation in certain things. So the test was pretty simple and he'd already conducted the test and he was pretty excited about it. And what you needed to do was get one of these. This is a humidifier. Put one of these in with your cigars and it will keep them at a 69% moisture level, that easy. So about a month ago, I got one of these and I put it inside a bag of coffee. And for a control, I got another bag of exactly the same roast. And they've both been sealed, set in a relatively normal environment for about a month. And so what we need to do now is taste them to see if there's any difference. In the names of science, I'm gonna try and taste them blind. I can't do this on my own, so Michael's gonna help me out here. I'm gonna step out of the studio and he's gonna set up three cupping bowls or cupping mugs in this case as that's what we have. And two of them will be the same and one will be different. And I don't know which one is which and I will come back and I will taste them. And see if firstly, I can tell the odd one out. The odd one out might be the one that has the high humidity, it might not be the one that has the high humidity. I won't know. And I'll try and also say with the odd one out whether I think it's better or whether I think it's worse. And maybe at the end of this, there's gonna be something interesting. So I'm gonna step away now and I'll come back to a cupping set up, ready to break, ready to go, and we'll go from there. So here we are. I've slightly rearranged this just to make it easier for you, actually. And also for me. Now, I can't really see an obvious difference, which is good. And I don't think I can smell one either. No. I have an inkling of an idea, but I'm not sure. So I'm gonna clean these and then we're gonna have to let them cool down for a little while. So these are too hot to taste. We know this 'cause we've cupped together before, and if we haven't cupped together, there's a little video up there for you to get you started on how to taste coffee at home. But while it's waiting to cool down, I'm gonna tell you about the sponsor of this series, which is Squarespace. Whenever I build a website now, I use Squarespace. And I've used Squarespace to build a website like my own personal portfolio of work or a showcase for my book. And the reason I like using Squarespace is that it's so quick and easy for me to take something that is mine. My idea, my work, and turn it into a beautiful website. I can take one of their templates and shape it and fill it with my ideas, my pictures, my words, and turn it into something that's truly mine. Beyond that, I don't have to worry about how it looks across different platforms, different browsers, different devices, that's all taken care of. As it is things like updating or patching things. There's no need to worry about any of it, whether it's a hobby or it's for work. It could be a business, it could be a portfolio of your writing. You need to have a beautiful presence online. And I think Squarespace is a great way to easily achieve that. But don't take my word for it. Go, use the link down below and sign up for a trial. Use it, build something. And when you're ready to launch, use code JAMESHOFFMANN for 10% off your first website or domain. Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. We've cooled these down a little bit. They should be ready for the first round of tasting. And I'm a little bit nervous. What if there's something here? What if there's not something here? Either way, well, it's a thing. That's not what I thought was gonna happen. Deep down, I thought there would just be a very obvious, very unpleasant one. That was the one that was high humidity. So my first thought is this ball's a little flat. This one's got a little bit more sparkle to it. And annoyingly, this one's kind of in the middle. That's the point of triangle tests. Can I even taste the difference? What's interesting to me is that ahead of time if you just said one of these has been held in a 69% humidity environment for a month, I would've thought that would have been extremely obvious. And it isn't extremely obvious that there's some differences between the cups, but the whole triangle test thing makes you constantly second guess yourself. All right, I think I'm ready to reach a conclusion. I think this is the odd one out and I think I'm gonna go against, I don't know. I think this is the one that's high humidity. I think this is the odd one out. Should we find out? And so, apparently I was right. I have now been informed that this one is the one that was with the high humidity pack. It's definitely interesting. It's definitely changed the way it's aged and it hasn't made it oxidized in a totally unusual way. As they're cooling now, it's definitely a lower asset experience, which is particularly interesting. But not really at the expense of much else. There's less acidity than these two bowls but it's not like you've got a bunch of other off flavors. It's just softened it out. If you wanna try this, I will put a link down below to the little humidity packs. If you wanna try this, this is a kind of odd one. I just thought it might be worth throwing out into the world. Has anyone done stuff like this? It doesn't make any sense. It makes me wanna come back to this in another month and to see what another month of aging for that exact same coffee does with that high humidity thing. Maybe a month isn't long enough to have really big differences show up, I just don't know. It's tricky. It's definitely pleasant still. I don't know. I'd really be interested to hear your thoughts on this one. Initially I ended the video here, but I don't wanna end the video here. So I did some more testing. I decided I would take the two bags of coffee in with me to square model and I would brew two v60s. I enlisted Gareth's help. And together we brewed side-by-side. We enlisted anyone who was willing to be on camera and gave them two samples of coffee, an AB test. One of the humid coffee, one of the normal coffee. And we were intrigued to see which one that most people picked and why. Left. That one. Preference? That one. Why? Fuller and more complex. Brighter. This one's like slightly sweeter. Which do you prefer? This one. I prefer the right one. Not very convinced with this, missing something. This is definitely more tasty. That one? Tell me why. I think it's got a bit of balance. It's a quite tea like, sweetness, less acidity. I think beads would bought this as it has better acids. Now, this is not conclusive of anything other than this was interesting. And I think that when we brewed the two v60s side-by-side, what was interesting to me was how different the blooms were. The coffee that had been stored in humid conditions barely bloomed. Now, I suspect extracted a little bit higher that may have led to an increase of texture, of mouthfeel in that particular sample. That aside, I think everyone who tasted the two, they were kinda surprised by the whole thing. And I think it's just worth someone else if you're out there, having a go with this. Maybe there's nothing here, right? Maybe this was just a fluke.", "videoID": "J7xEbf1mkm0"}, {"title": "AeroPress Accessories & Upgrades (Episode #4)", "text": "Welcome to Episode 4 in our AeroPress series. Today we're talking accessories. I've gone out and sought every single AeroPress accessory that I can find and I think we've got some interesting stuff. Now, I can divide them into kind of three groups. We've got group one, which is external accessories, group two, pressurizing filters, and group three, alternative filters. And so we'll work our way through each of the groups and talk about what we've got. As a quick intro, we've got the PUCKPUCK for making cold brew coffee with your AeroPress, we've got this delightful battle station for keeping all your AeroPress accoutrements together and happy, and we've got this, the 2POUR, for splitting your brews. In the second category of pressurized filters, we've got the Fellow Prismo, which I have looked at on this channel before but it must make a return, and also the Joepresso. Finally, in the filtration camp, we've got three choices. We've got a metal filter from Able. Actually, we've got two different discs from them. We've got a cloth AeroPress filter from The Cloth Filter Co. and we've got some premium filter papers from Aesir. Starting at the first group, starting with the first thing, let's talk about the PUCKPUCK. Now, I'm talking about this first because, actually, to use it takes a couple of hours at least because it's a cold dripper. The way it works is actually delightfully simple. This at the top, you put your ice and water into. And here, this little dial will control your drip rate onto your coffee. Now, you don't ever want to have cold brew drip directly onto coffee 'cause it will dig a little hole and it'll kind of build a channel. So what you tend to get are little distribution devices. Now, often, think about the kind of Hario cold drippers, you use filter paper. Here, they've got a little disc that will sit on top of our coffee. Let's put it together. We'll use their recipe, which is 38 grams of coffee, a hundred grams of ice, and 400 grams of cold water on the top and then dripping aiming for about a 2 1/2 to 3-hour brew time. So it's brewing now. We'll come back to it when it's finished. I'll say a couple things now. It's well-built. I quite like how it's put together. It feels premium throughout. It's a little bit fiddly. Dropping the little blue plastic disc on top I got wrong a couple of times. It sort of fell midair and I had to sort of dig it out with a fork to sort of drop it back in and make it nice and level. Kind of annoying, but that might also be my inability to drop a plastic disc straight. So, you know, user error. And then it did take a little bit of effort to sort of get the drops flowing at the rate that they recommended. But once it's set up, it seems pretty easy. We'll come back to you in a little bit. Next up is the 2POUR. It's a simple device. It's a splitter for AeroPress brewing. The idea is you press on top of it and it splits your brewer into two different cups. It's \u00a317 and it's a single piece of plastic. It doesn't feel particularly premium. It feels pretty cheap. The edges aren't beautiful on here. I don't necessarily understand why it's \u00a317 and I don't necessarily understand why it exists because if I had a complaint about the AeroPress is that it doesn't easily make coffee for more than one person. But maybe you're doing the heavy brew and bypass thing, so we should test if it works. And to be ruthless in our testing, we should see how effective it is in splitting the liquid out. So I'll brew a brew. I'll use the AeroPress technique from our previous video, Episode 3, it's up here if you haven't seen it yet, and we'll weigh out the split in liquid and see how good a job it does. I'm having a bit of a moment here because the way I like to brew is I brew on top of the thing I'm gonna press onto. If I do that, then I'll have something dripping. So I'll have to kind of brew onto a carafe, stop, you know, use the plunger to create a vacuum, move it across, or maybe lift it up, pour the liquid into the splitter, that might go badly, and then put this on top and wait and then press. I mean, maybe I'm just supposed to do the inverted method, but you know how I feel about that. So potentially a flaw in the design unless you're just, you know, brewing on here the whole time and you're just kind of winging it in terms of brew water weight. Maybe we do that. Maybe I just give in and just, you know, be free, don't weigh anything. This will stress me out but I think it's the fairest test. Now I'm just gonna guess what 200 mls looks like, or 200 grams, more precisely. Yeah, already a little uneven distribution. We'll see if that bias continues once, you know, we hit some higher flow rates. I have no idea how much liquid I put in there and I find that quite stressful because we know that the amount of liquid that you put in has a massive impact on extraction. So just eyeballing it is not a recipe for success. I wish that wasn't the case but it's true. Let the pressing commence. Like four grams more on this side even though this side had a headstart. So weird distribution as we go. So, yeah, I got it wrong actually. I poured about 30 grams under 200 grams, so. I've gotta say, it's just not for me. For \u00a317 I'd probably spend two or three more pounds and buy a nice glass pitcher that looks beautiful that you can use for other stuff in your life and have in your kitchen and be a multipurpose thing or just something that feels nice and looks nice. For \u00a317, I can't justify this as a kind of object or an accessory for an AeroPress. If you have one and love one, let me know down in the comments below. I'd love to hear from 2POUR users how you feel about it, what you paid for it. Was it worth it? Let's move on. So next up, we have a kind of fun one, which is the Hexnub AeroPress Organizer. They do a sort of double-width one. They do a single-width one too. This is like the double garage version. You know, you could always, though, just sort of split your AeroPress if you don't have two. You could store them separately like that. There you go. Nice, easy. It's not flawlessly made for the money, right? Like, it's not a lot of stuff. The little hex rubber mats are nice enough. I don't really know why you need them, but they're nice enough. This just doesn't quite feel beautifully made or, you know, particularly accurately made, right? It feels a bit wonky in places. The detailing is there. You've got, like, your little scoop holder, your little paddle holder. Overall, you don't quite get what you pay for but I kind of like the idea enough. If this appeals to you, it's an option. Doesn't work for me, but that's just 'cause I wanna hide things away in my life and not have them out on the sides and stuff. Let's move on. So let's brew with the Prismo. I've talked about it on the channel before but we should reassess for this for a couple reasons. The interesting thing here is the inside, you've got this little valve and that restricts your flow. Now, the upside is that if you don't wanna brew inverted, this would stop liquid dripping out of the bottom of your brew if you're brewing the normal way around, right? Before you get the plunger in to sort of create that vacuum effect, this will keep all the water in 'cause this little valve will only open when it's pressurized, when it's pushed open. Now, it does come with this metal filter that is very necessary to sit on top and this will act as a filter. You could put a paper filter on top of this, I think, if you wanted a cleaner brew, but let's get a brew going. Now, we're gonna be using the Smart Espresso Profiling attachment because I wanna see what kind of pressure this thing opens at and see if it lets me generate more pressure because what this thing registers is not just how hard I'm pressing. It's the sort of trapped pressure inside, which is pressure in less whatever pressure is getting out. Now, in a normal AeroPress brew, you've got quite a large open area for pressure to escape, so you can't build high pressures easily. But if you restrict that, similarly, with the Joepresso to come, can you get higher pressures? Let's find out. So this is ready to go. To make things a bit more ridiculous, I'm gonna press on something else to sort of leverage the full potential of the Smart Espresso Profiler. Let me show you. Here I've got the base of a juicer with the juicing attachment gone. I'm gonna press on this and then the scale can sit below and sort of track the flow rate of liquid through the AeroPress so we can sort of have a flow profile as well as a pressure profile. So ready to press. I'm gonna press too hard 'cause I wanna see if I can build more pressure up with this little thing than I could in a normal AeroPress. Let's give it a big press. Hopefully I don't make too much mess. (James grunts, coffee splashes) Whoa! Got a, you know, pretty steady pressure. We hit 1.14 bars there. So not a big change. Let's try that again with a paper filter. So this is the metal-filtered brew and it has something of the taste that we experienced in the testing video, Episode 2, of high-pressure brews. It's got a lot more bitterness than I would really want. It's quite harsh. Obviously it's not particularly filtered so there's a bit more sort of sediment that will add to the bitterness, but I don't think that's the cause. I think brewing at very high pressures is not, for filtered coffee like this, a great idea in the AeroPress. Still, I'm curious how high can we go if we've got a paper and metal. Can I build more pressure with the valve? Maybe make less mess this time. 1.3 bars. Now, let's be clear, do not be tempted, if you've got a setup like this, to get up on your countertop and press with your foot to see how hard you can press. Only a fool would do that. Not recommended at home. Come on now. This is just me currently messing around and trying to understand what effect the Prismo has. It obviously works very well to keep liquid in the AeroPress. So as designed, pretty great. You can add a paper filter. I think that's good. The one thing I wanna test before we compare it to the Joepresso is their kind of pseudo-espresso recipe where you grind espresso fine, right? 20 grams of ground coffee in, I'll use an espresso roast for this, and then 50 grams of water, quite a lot of agitation, and then a reasonably hard press and the metal filter only and, in theory, some crema potentially. But we'll be able to see what kind of pressure we're getting in that environment with this and the Joepresso to see if it's, you know, again, like, a bar, bar and a half, which probably should be enough to create some foam. Now, that brew was actually under a 1 to 1.5, so, you know, maybe I should have pressed a little bit more liquid through. I felt like we got to where we needed to go. Brief amount of foam appeared and sort of disappeared on the top but this coffee is never gonna give a ton of crema in these kind of situations. But interestingly, never really above a bar. I think I peaked out at like 0.9 of a bar. Really not bad actually. It's a small strong coffee. It's not espresso strength, but it's not far off actually. It's not wildly underextracted. It's not overly acidic actually. It's interesting. If I was mixing that into something like a milk drink that I was making at home, then that's kind of interesting. That's all right. I'm surprised. Let's compare it to the Joepresso, which does a similar thing in a different way. So this is the Joepresso. Now, it's a bit more expensive than the Prismo. This is about \u00a329, the Prismo about \u00a318. Aiming to do a similar-ish thing but not. So this is trying to do espresso with an AeroPress quite explicitly. You've got some pieces. Here you've got a pressurized basket. So it looks like a normal basket but there's only one exit hole at the bottom, so everything gets constrained there. A little bit like the Prismo valve but different. This you fill with coffee. You tamp it down. Doesn't come with a tamper and this is a nonstandard basket size, so that's a bit awkward. Probably tamp it with this, though, it does have a big kind of nut holding the screen in place. And this acts like the screen of your espresso machine where the water flows out from. So once you've ground your coffee, you put this on top, then you drop it into its little holder cap that will allow you to lock into the AeroPress. You add a little rubber gasket to make sure that there's no leaks as you're pressing very hard. So let's give it a try. So they say for a 2:1 espresso, you wanna add a 3:1 ratio. So I've got 15 grams of coffee. I'm gonna add 45 of water. Now, looking at this, the screen doesn't perfectly cover the grounds. And they also say if you wanna pre-infuse, push just a little bit, like three seconds, and then back off. So I'm gonna press. This is much trickier because you've got a compacted bed of ground coffee, just like espresso, to try and get the water through and it doesn't seem particularly interested in that. So I'm gonna go a little harder. I've got a very small amount of liquid flowing out at this point. So I might surmise that, actually, espresso grind is too fine and, as is kind of common with a pressurized portafilter, you'd wanna grind coarser. Definitely too fine. So this does not need an espresso grind. Now, that last brew was entirely operator error, right? Like, I put the wrong grind of coffee in there. That's my fault. That's not me being negative about the Joepresso. It's not built for real fine espresso grinds. It says fine to medium pre-ground coffee. It's a pressurized basket. So we've gone a bit coarser. You know, close to where I'd actually brew, like, filter coffee for an AeroPress. We'll try that. Interesting, I got up to about a bar. How does it taste? Not great. It tastes underextracted and I think for a roast this light, you would need to grind finer, but I think then you have issues generating enough pressure to get through a finer grind to have it really work. I think this is a device that will be at its best with medium to dark roasts, rather than light roasts. It's an interesting idea. I feel like the pressures you build in an AeroPress, you know, I'm a large man. I weigh a reasonable amount. I can't build more than two bars of pressure using my entire body weight. Hopefully that illustrates how much pressure nine bars really is. But back to this, I think low-pressure espresso brewing with a basket, with a pressurized basket, might give you a little bit of foam on the top of your cup but I don't think it gives you an espresso-like brew or a better brew necessarily. If it was a choice, in a way, between the Prismo and the Joepresso, I'd probably pick the Prismo. It's a little bit more flexible. It works well for filter brewing or that sort of strong espresso-style brewing. This feels a little bit more focused on one thing only. But if you wanna brew with darker roasts and have more of a kind of foamy, espresso-style thing, it's kind of a fun thing to use. It is more expensive than the Prismo, which sort of works against it, but it's also, you know, one person's project rather than a company making one of many products, which is always worth considering. But I'll finish by saying again, the AeroPress does not and cannot make espresso. You can make small strong coffees. They are not what I would define as espresso. That involves brewing at higher pressures. They don't taste like espresso. They don't look like espresso. They aren't espresso in that regard and you just can't generate really high pressures with an AeroPress no matter what you put on this side of it, and that's that. Now, before we talk about the next section, which is, I think, probably the most interesting of these sections, we do need to talk about this video's sponsor, which is Native. When Native approached me about sponsoring a video on the channel, I was kind of curious. And then they sent over a bunch of their plastic-free deodorants and I realized I'd been making a terrible mistake. You see, I'd been living my life just by buying the least offensive plastic-wrapped deodorant from wherever and kind of making do. I didn't really care, and I realized I was missing out, firstly, on a plastic-free experience. This is a paperboard and it just feels nice to use every single day. It's super simple. You just push it up from the bottom. It works really well. They sent me several different deodorants from their range and they all smelt fantastic. In fact, if you're curious, click the link in the description and go and browse the website. They have some amazing scents on offer, and I keep wanting to call them flavors. But who doesn't wanna smell delicious? And on top of that, I like that I look at the ingredients list and I know what these things are. It's full of familiar things, like shea butter or coconut oil, and it's an aluminum-free, paraben-free, and sulfate-free. Like I said, if you're curious, go and click the link below. Have a browse around. Usually, three deodorants are $39. With the code HOFFMANN it's 25% off, making it $29. There's free shipping within the US and they ship to a bunch of other countries too. There's just details down below here. So our final section is the one I'm kind of the most interested in which is a comparison of filtration method. Here's how it's gonna work. I'm gonna brew four brews back to back. Then we're gonna mix them up and I'll do a blind tasting and see if I can pick out which is which 'cause there's a kind theory around filtration and I wanna see if it holds true all the way through to tasting. Now, the four filters we have are the AeroPress classics. Now, these are \u00a37 for 350. So they're about two pence a piece. The Aesir, which are about $10 Canadian or about \u00a36 for 100, which makes them six pence each, so three times the price. The Cloth Filter. This was \u00a34 delivered in the UK. And much like the Able discs here, you get two for \u00a320, the more you use them, the closer they get to free. As I said, same recipe you've seen with everything else. Let's get on and make four AeroPresses back to back. There is gonna be some slurping but we'll cut all the slurps out. You can have one, those of you that like the slurps. I know most of you hate them. So  there's your one. Feel like that one's metal. It's got, like, a little bit more dustiness to it, like a little bit of chalkiness in there. I'm gonna say that's cloth because it has this kind of richness. It's clean still, but it's got, like, a little bit more weight to it that I think is very pleasant and quite common with cloth. These I would say are the paper brews in the middle. It's not a great scientific test. I feel like that might be the thicker paper but I don't know. Number three. Good, I'm one for one. I feel like I'm gonna go to the safe spot, which is I feel like this was metal. And it is. It's number four. I said this was the original paper, I think. It is the original paper. Okay, good. And then this is the Aesir paper. I just don't know why I looked. Well, we learned that things act in the way that you expect them to. What I mean by that is that the paper has done a better job filtering out all the particles and pieces but the AeroPress paper is thinner and doesn't do as good a job as the Aesir, which is thicker. Now, the difference in taste is incremental and you could say that the Aesir are three times the price or you could say that they're 4p a brew more expensive. If you prize clarity, if you want that pour over, kind of paper-filtered clarity in your cup, I think they're actually a great choice for that. The AeroPress papers work very well. Maybe we'll talk about using more than one paper in the future. But for now, let's talk about the cloth. It's known, I've done a video on cloth brewing, it's up here, that I have a fondness for cloth brewers. That combination of clarity and texture is very enjoyable. But, as we talked about, maintaining cloth is a bit more work. I think for four pounds, it's a relatively cheap investment in your AeroPress brewing. I think there are people doing cloth filters in the US. I'll find some links and leave them in the description below. But I do like cloth brewing if you're willing to do the work to maintain your cloth long term. You know, as a reusable choice, it is a good one. But metal is the much easier long-term reusable choice. Keeping it clean is relatively simple. There's none of the kind of upkeep of cloth. And yeah, you get a brew that is a little bit chalkier, a little bit more bitter, a little bit heavier and siltier, and some people really like that. Some people like that about traditional French press brew. It's not my preference, but that doesn't mean it can't be your preference. As long as you know what you're getting into, I think that's pretty fair. Now, Able make a couple of filters. They are very good. You know, I know people who've used them for a long time and had good results. They're not the only filters on the market. There are a bunch of different metal filters out there. But I just can't buy everything and test everything. But I think they're a good example of a well-made metal filter and I would certainly be comfortable recommending them as a product. Now, there are two other metal filters we've touched on today but not used. One is the one within the Prismo, we didn't really brew a proper brew with it, and then the other Able brewer that comes in that kit. What I will say about finer metal filters is that you do have a little bit less siltiness but it will still taste like a metal-filtered brew. You may have a preference about what kind of level of texture you've comfortable with, and I generally am pro finer holes but it still tastes like a metal-filtered brew. And that's not a bad thing. That's just what it is. Now, we haven't quite finished. We haven't forgotten about the PUCKPUCK that we started a little while ago. So to wrap it up, let's bring that back and have a little taste. So this video's taken a few hours to film and in that time, the PUCKPUCK has finished brewing. It has an uphill battle with me personally because I don't like the taste of cold brew, cold drip coffee very much. But hopefully I can get past my own preference and talk about whether you might like it. Whether it's extracted or not is kind of down to the grind size. I went relatively fine and for a ratio of what is about 76 grams a liter. You're aiming, actually, for quite a strong brew that you might wanna pour over ice that might dilute a little bit more, you know, over time. But let's have a taste for now. Is it strong? Is it tasty? You know, while it's not for me, it has a kind of combination of a slightly oxidized and slightly vegetal characteristic that I find common in almost every coffee brewed this way, I can totally see why people would like that low-acidity, high-body, caramelly kind of undertone that is there. It doesn't really taste like the coffee that we've brewed with in this video, that we brewed hot and tasted a bunch of times, but it has some texture, it has some sweetness. The cup is very clean. It's an AeroPress filter but because there's no pressure and the bed itself is kind of self-filtering, nice clarity to the brew. But, ultimately, you know, it's gonna taste like cold-brewed coffee. And if you like that, well, maybe think about it. For \u00a330, it's well-made. It feels like you're getting value for money. I quite like it. I just don't like the coffee that it makes, but that's a preference thing. That's not about right or wrong. It's not flawed. It's just not for me. In fact, I don't get to keep any of these. Everything on here, like all the stuff I review, gets given away to my Patreon supporters who make videos like this possible, giving me a budget to just go out and buy this stuff. So thank you to them.", "videoID": "Qz_GZpzpst4"}, {"title": "How To Brew Better Dark Roasts", "text": "Come to today's video all about brewing better dark roasts as filter coffee. We're not really going to touch on espresso today. Just brewed coffee, how to make it more delicious when you're starting with a darker roast. Now, historically this channel hasn't talked about dark roasts. It's talked about light roasts most of the time, and that's because within this sort of specialty coffee world, people tend to gravitate towards lighter roasts because you tend to see more kind of taste of place. More of the origin characteristics in a coffee that is lighter roasted. It'll have more floral or fruity kind of qualities. It'll often be a little bit more aromatic. It may be a little bit more sweet but it will often be much more acidic as a result. Now, when you roast coffee, the longer you roast coffee, the more you will sort of degrade that acidity. The more it will decline, but the longer you roast coffee the more bitterness you typically will get. This happens in loads of other things, the most obvious being caramels that starts as very sweet. The darker you take it, the more bitter it becomes, the less sweet it becomes. But take it too far and you've burnt it and it just tastes bad, be that caramel, be that coffee. So in this video, I'm not going to be advocating for coffee taken all the way to pretty much burned or kind of charcoal you know, at that point, that is a thing that you see. I'm not a huge advocate for that in any way. By darker roasts, what I typically mean, especially when talking about filter coffee is that the coffee is taken probably to the point where you're beginning to see oils on the surface of the bean. During roasting a lot of pressure builds up inside a coffee bean, initially that will cause it to pop or crack relatively early in the process. And as you keep roasting it, it can happen again. There can be a second crack, a second release of pressure but all of that time, this internal pressure in the bean is pushing oils to the surface which is why darker roasts look much oilier on the outside. Now I will say right now, one of the challenges of darker roasts is that this process of pushing oil to the surface, this longer roasting process gives you a more porous coffee bean. You can feel that when you crush them in your fingers. It's much easier to crush a dark roasted bean than a light roasted one. Being more porous exposes it to more air and ultimately dark roasted coffee will stale much faster. So this brings us actually to tip number one. Pay attention to freshness, more than ever. With lighter roasted coffees you'll typically see recommendations of buy it as freshly as you can, let it de-gas for maybe a week. And then you've got, well somewhere between three and six weeks is the kind of typical range of recommendations in which to drink the coffee in which it will taste good. Darker roasts everything is a bit accelerated. They'll de gas faster but they'll also have generated more CO2 in the roasting process. So they still do need and still do benefit from a little bit of resting. However, once you start to brew, you'll begin to notice stale flavors much, much sooner than you would do with lighter roasts. So I would say you really want to be using it within two, three weeks, sort of maximum, if you want the best possible experience. I's still perfectly drinkable beyond that point but you're not necessarily getting what you paid your good money for in terms of flavor. Now, in making this video, I had to think about who is this video for? And I think there are two groups of people who would benefit from what we're going to talk about today. Group one are people that drink dark roasted filter coffee every day and I want them to enjoy it a little bit more because I want everyone to enjoy coffee a little bit more. And then there's group two, people who don't really like the taste of dark roasted coffee as filtered coffee but might be stuck with nothing else to brew and wondering how do I get the best out of this? Now I'm working on the idea that you both want the same thing, you want as much complexity as possible from the coffee, as little bitterness as possible from the coffee, you want texture, you want body, you want mouthfeel and you want it to be as enjoyable as it can be. Now, bitterness is a complex subject in coffee. A lot of people really dislike bitterness but they prefer dark roasts because they really, really dislike acidity. And I understand that, having an acidic cup of coffee to many people is a kind of revolting idea or a very unpleasant idea. They've learned that the taste of coffee is typically more bitter and so often that's dosed with a little dairy or a little bit of sugar to soften the bitterness, to hide the bitterness a little bit. And that's the kind of benchmark of how coffee tastes for them. And again, I'm trying to make coffee taste good. So even if you're putting cream or sugar into it, it tastes that little bit more enjoyable, that little bit more pleasurable. But if you do want to explore coffee with less of those things in it because it doesn't need them because it is less bitter, then it should be a welcoming and interesting cup, if you start to drop the sugar, maybe or try it with a little less cream or no cream one day just to see what you think, see what the coffee itself tastes like. So now it's time to talk about brewing coffee and I'm going to recommend with a pour over using a paper filter. Now, if you'd like a French press, if you'd like that sort of sediment thing, go with it. If that's your actual preference, then keep doing that. But if it's not, if you just want to reduce bitterness then I would recommend paper filters. The reason they work is that they don't let any tiny pieces of coffee through into the brew. Those tiny pieces do taste bitterness. They add an extra layer of bitterness to the cup. So removing it does remove some bitterness from the brew right at the start. A lot of people, I think like Chemex papers in particular for this, they're much thicker papers. They're two to three times heavier than say a V60 paper, but a V60 paper, in my experience, works well enough to capture all the bits and pieces and leave you with a nice clean cup. Now, the coffee that we're using today is relatively dark for filter coffee. You can see there is a little bit of oil coming to the surface. They're getting that kind of sheen, over time these would get oilier. So when it comes to brewing, the first thing we'll talk about is grind size. Now, when you roast a coffee darker, it's easier to extract that coffee. Confusingly, there's less stuff to extract, you know as you roast coffee, more and more of it comes away as either smoke or other things and it kind of disappears. There's less soluble material in darker roasted coffee than there isn't lighter roasted coffee but it's more soluble, what's left is easier to get. So I would recommend you grinding notably coarser for a darker roast than a lighter roast. I'll show you on screen now a comparison between where I would grind for say a V60 of a light roast versus a V60 of a dark roast. Now this gets us immediately into a slightly confusing topic which is that of extraction. I want to reduce my extraction. You know, I know when to under extract the coffee. Essentially that often happens by, you know not extracting the coffee evenly. I want to do it all evenly. I just want a little bit less from the coffee and again, that's where a courser of grind comes into it. Now because the coffee is much more fragile when it is ground it does shatter and produce more fines. It's extremely brittle. So typically you can get more fines with darker roasts. You could argue that you should sift out those fines, that would help reduce the bitterness of a brew. I just, I'm not a hundred percent there on sifting because it feels wasteful. I end up with coffee that I have to just throw away and I would rather go a different route to a better cup. Now, if you have an enormous amount of patience, you can slowly feed the coffee into your grinder rather than throw it in all at once. That will help reduce fines, too. We made a video about that up here if you want to check that out. I'm not saying do that, it's just a thing worth noting. So our coffee is in. And the second thing about the recipe is that we're going to use a much higher dose. I would recommend something closer to 70 grams per liter, rather than 60. We are grinding coarser and that will reduce our extraction. And that would then reduce the strength of the cup which we don't necessarily want to do. So we're going to increase the dose to increase the strength again. So 70 grams a liter works super well. And then we need to talk about brew temperature. Now this is a slightly complicated subject. In the past, I've given you broad guidelines which is the darker the roast, the lower the brew temperature that you want to use. Now I've been spending some time trying to unpick this a little bit more, and I stand by that. I certainly wouldn't recommend using boiling water you know, just off the boil to brew this entire V60 because you'd end up with some dominant bitterness, a pretty harsh after taste, a little bit of smoke there. And that brew would definitely be improved by dairy and sugar or a dairy alternative and sugar but maybe we don't have to do that. And yes, if I just had one option of brewing different temperatures, I'd be, with a roast this dark, looking at 80 to 85 as a brew temperature. And that would produce quite a soft, gentle brew. But recently I've been experimenting with trying to get a bit more complexity in the cup while still retaining the qualities of that lower brew temperature.

Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So here's the deal. This is kind of a technique that I've used in the past when brewing espresso where I've had a bit of control over temperature and boilers and that kind of stuff. I've found that, same thing with espresso where you want to pull shots at say 80 degrees C with dark roasts to have a heavy bodied, full, rich, not overly bitter cup, but if you are able to start with very hot water right at the beginning just to get the extraction going you tend to have a more complex and interesting cup. That's what we're going to do here. If you're willing to do a bit of work this is kind of interesting. So I would say if you start with boiling water just for the bloom and then brew the rest of the brew at 80 degrees Celsius, for example, you end up with more complexity, but not too much bitterness, plenty of extraction, plenty of body, plenty of texture but a cleaner, smoother after taste. I would be speculating if I was to tell you why this was the case so know that right now. Firstly, you'd noticed that the bloom with 80 degree C water and boiling water is very different. You get a lot more de-gassing from the coffee with water freshly off the boil. And you are beginning an extraction process though. Though, your ratio of water to coffee is pretty inefficient and the temperature drop is pretty rapid as that boiling water hits at room temperature coffee. But it seems to me that you pull out just a little bit more in that phase, but in the remainder of the brew at 80 degrees C you don't really extract those harsh bitter things that need higher temperatures to get out into your brew. Now, if this seems impractical, then I would agree to some extent it is, though it's not the end of the world. If you have a temperature control kettle then this isn't too difficult. What are you going to do is take about half to two thirds of the water that you'll need and you'll bring that up to the boiling point and you'll pour what you need for the bloom. Put it back on the stand, change your target temperature, add cold water, enough to drop the temperature below your target and then let it come up to 80. That can comfortably be done in the 45 seconds that I would recommend blooming the coffee for. Now because you're brewing with coarser ground coffee, do expect a faster overall brew time as well. And so what you end up with, I think is a brew that plays to the strengths of the coffee. At that darker roast, it has a higher capacity for body and texture and richness and we should work with that, use that. It has reduced acidity and that means we can play with a lower extraction level without throwing the cup out of balance. But it can reduce the bitterness, the harshness of that and end up with something very tasty if you like more developed flavors. And if you don't, then I think it's not so far away from the kind of coffees that you enjoy that you have to completely cover it with dairy or sugar or something to kind of mask the things that you really dislike. What you end up with is a very friendly cup of coffee. And ultimately for me, the goal here is that people as a whole, drink and enjoy coffee and value coffee more. I would rather people were drinking dark roasts from great producers, great green coffees, you know that have been roasted away that maybe I don't love but I still love that they drank those than drank dark roast of lower quality coffees or coffees produced at below the cost of production and still happens out there.", "videoID": "lrRdRxAqMHc"}, {"title": "A Coffee Kickstarter Cautionary Tale", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about this. This is the COFFEEJACK. This is a handheld manual espresso maker. You put ground coffee and hot water in, you press it with your hands, and espresso comes out. And it is perhaps the quintessential coffee Kickstarter cautionary tale, a phrase that I did have to practice before saying it out loud. And today, I wanna talk about both it as a review, does it work, is it good, does it make tasty coffee, but also use this as an opportunity to talk about Kickstarters in general, specifically coffee ones, but also kind of just the whole world of crowdfunding and backing projects and how we might learn from this particular device how to think about them in the future. I should give you a little bit of backstory if you're not familiar with this. So, this has been something of a controversial Kickstarter because it has been incredibly late. Going all the way back, this launched back in October 2019. And back then, they were proposing to deliver round about May the following year, so May 2020. Some of you will probably see where this going, knowing what happened in the year of 2020. But they finally delivered this to me in February 2023, which is really, really late. And people accused them of all sorts of things. People accused them of being scammers. They just got a lot of flak from all sides. And let me be clear. In this video, I am not out to vilify or demonize the people that created this product. I'm sure they have had a very stressful few years, finally bringing this thing to market through all the challenges and delays they had. And so, to be honest, I probably have more sympathy than I do anger. But that's kind of what we're gonna talk about today. So going all the way back, it's 2019. I see this, loads of people send it to me. It's a really successful Kickstarter. It's kind of everywhere, so I'm like, \"Fine, it's 69 pounds, I will back it. I'll have a go. I'll see what happens.\" Not really sure what they were gonna make. It seemed ambitious to create that much pressure in this small of a space with this kind of a mechanism. And then, in 2020, the world happened to everyone. People who were trying to manufacture products in China had a really difficult time, and this got pushed back and pushed back and pushed back. And then when they did start to get into manufacturing, they had loads of issues. And so, I think by August 2021, they issued like a big long update on Kickstarter, kind of covering everything that had gone wrong up to that point, aiming for delivery towards the end of that year. For context, the Picopresso by Wacaco was launched in, I think, June 2021. So, that was out on the market ahead of this thing. This would've been first, but that beat it to the punch by quite a long way. By May 2022, they'd issued another update, being like, \"It's okay, it's manufacturing, it's shipping, it's shipping, it's manufacturing.\" And it didn't ship, and I think this constant stream of updates was very confusing for people who had backed this project. Some people felt they were being strung along by scammers. Others were kind of reassured and others who probably knew something about the process of getting stuff made were like, \"They're having a terrible time, and you know, luck is against them. Their designs are problematic, it seems, and they've got lots of stuff to fix. But that's the nature of building stuff.\" So they finally delivered it to me, and this is what arrived. This is my 69 pounds worth of coffeemaker. Notable, I think, to say, at this point, that if you buy one of these new today, it's 150 pounds, which is a lot more. So, I got a pretty big discount for my Kickstarter sort of contribution. If this was the only thing that had arrived, maybe this review would go in a different kind of way. They did also send a few extras through. I think I bought a stand along the way, and then they sent me a bunch of stuff for no real reason. But it does change the pricing for this thing. You know, I'll talk about this is a, is it 69 pounds, is that good value for money? But that's a question that's only really relevant to people who paid that money back then and got the Kickstarter unit. Later, when we talk about should you buy one of these today, it's a very, very different financial equation. I guess now, we'll take it to pieces and show you kind of how it works. It's a pretty clever design. I will say that. There's some really nice thought in this. It is well-made. I can't help but compare it to the Wacaco Picopresso. Now we did test that product in a strange day out in London where we took a bunch of portable espresso makers and made espresso in a bunch of strange places. The Picopresso in the middle of the Thames. If you haven't seen it, it's up here if you wanna watch that. I do recommend it. It was a good day out. This thing breaks apart into kind of two main pieces. The bottom here is your basket. That's where you're gonna load and tamp your ground coffee. They do some as standard with a kind of little pressure valve here to act like a pressurized portafilter to give you crema with coarsely ground coffee. You can take it out pretty easily. I took mine out. I don't wanna do that. I've got good grinders. That's not a problem for me. Then you've got the sort of main piece of it. This bit pops out. And it's your pumping mechanism. So, this is how we're gonna generate pressure. And you put your hot water in the tank, you lock your coffee into place, and you pump, and espresso happens. There's some details on their website. I'll show you their kind of design. But one of the little tweaks in here is there's actually an over pressure valve, so that if you create more then nine bars of pressure inside this little space, it will actually bleed that pressure back out into the water tank above you, which is an interesting piece of design. It's lets you know roughly when you're getting to nine bars or above it, or you know, you can't really go above it, but when you're at that kind of point. I would not recommend brewing at very high pressures with this thing. I didn't have the best results that way. But let's make some coffee with it. Now I did say I had a stand. This is the stand. This unit does sit very neatly on top of it. You kind of need it if you're gonna make espresso. I don't have an espresso cup that this bit would sit on sort of safely. You know, you'd be pressing onto a cup. I don't really think it's something I wanna be holding in the air because this is an open container of near boiling water. So, I don't feel like I wanna be kind of splashing that around over my hands. So I do want it down on something, but I want it on something robust and significant. The stand is, I think, 45 pounds, so it's a little bit expensive. But I would say, if you're making espresso with this, pretty much essential. If you're just making an espresso like thing at the bottom of a mug to put some hot milk in to make a cappuccino or a latte, sure, I could see how you could get around that if you're not obsessing over the espresso. But if you do want to drink straight espresso and have a good time, I think you need the stand. So, factor that into the cost right now. Now, I am gonna have to preheat this unit quite significantly. If you put boiling water in here, and I stuck a probe in it and had a look, the boiling water without preheat will drop to low 80s, like 81, 82 degrees Celsius, pretty much instantly, and it'll hold there for about a minute or so before beginning to decline more often. That is too cool for most of the espresso that I would wanna drink. Interestingly, if I dump that water out once it's stabilized in temperature and put boiling water in, it held at around 91 degrees Celsius. And if I dumped that water out and put fresh boiling water in again, it was still at around 91 to 92 degrees Celsius. So, a preheat is essential, but double preheating is not. But you wanna preheat until right before you brew, dump that water out, fresh boiling water in, and then go to get the best temperatures if you're brewing lighter roasted coffees. Now, from a user perspective, getting coffee into this little basket is a little bit tricky. They don't give you a dosing funnel or anything like that with it. It just comes like this and it's sort of up to you to get the coffee in. I happen to have a dosing ring that just about fits, so I'm gonna use that, which is cheating, but I don't wanna make a mess. Give it a little distribution. Dose-wise, I think with lighter roasted coffees, you wouldn't wanna be above 15 grams. This is about 14 1/2 grams in here today. I say about 14 1/2 as if that's not incredibly precise to most people, but still, you know what I'm talking about. I would recommend distribution with this thing. We'll talk more about the dynamics of its brewing and its evenness in a second after we've made this coffee and what we might do to improve it, and I'll give you kind of my best shot routine that is a little different to maybe how they would recommend you use it. Now, this is the tamper that is extra. It's about 30 pounds, I think. It's quite nicely made. It's branded and everything, little etching on the bottom. It annoys me that this is not standard. Without this, you have no way to tamp it. I think it looks like they almost lock it in to tamp it in one of their videos. I would not recommend that at all. I think this does need to be tamped, and so, again, this I think is close to essential or a suitably fitting tamper. Because, frankly, as this is custom-made, it annoys me,  there's a little bit of play here. That shouldn't be there. I don't want a little bit of play. I want a perfect fit. This is designed by you for your product. Just the tolerances should be right. Sorry to complain about these things, but it's just nicer when they fit nicely. I'm not gonna load that in straight away because we need to preheat it and then dump some water through it, and I'll explain kind of a bit more about how the pumping mechanism works. So, this is my preheat water. It is annoying to have to boil a kettle and then particularly boil a kettle again to do this. The way this works is interesting. What I'm gonna do, I could just turn this upside down and dunk the water out, but I actually will push it through 'cause it's instructive. As you push down, nothing seems to happen, right? And that's the kind of pressing out moment. When you pull up, that's when water is drawn into the chamber. So you need to make sure that you allow the piston to come all the way up before you press again. And then you can see that when I come up, the level drops, and I push that water that I pulled in out. In doing that, I pumped that through 'til it was empty. And what you might've noticed when I first pressed is that nothing came out, 'cause that chamber is empty. So, what I'm gonna do actually is put fresh water in, nice hot water into a preheated unit. This is now hot to touch, another reason I don't really want to off the stand. I'll pump a couple of times just to make sure that chamber is consistently filled, then I'm gonna lock my coffee in, then I'm gonna brew some espresso. And then I've got a minute while this tares to start pre-infusion. So I'm gonna give it maybe three or four pumps, which will take me to 12 to 16 mils of water doing into the coffee. It's pretty consistent that when you pump, if you've allowed it to draw up properly, it'll give you four mils of water. I would recommend a relatively long pre-infusion on this if you're using finer grounds and trying to get higher extractions. And then, we're gonna go. And you'll start to feel resistance build, and you get a nice steady flow of espresso. I'll generally aim for about a three-to-one ratio. That seems to work best for me. It's not bad. It tastes a little bit like it's channeled. What you want in an espresso is all of the water to pass evenly through all of the coffee. If you get a sort of channel where some water can pass more quickly through the coffee, that water doesn't pick up much flavor, it's got a lot of sourness and also bitterness, 'cause it will over-extract that coffee because more water will pass through a smaller amount of coffee around that channel. And that's what that tastes like to me. It doesn't taste incredibly even, that was well-distributed, that was well-tamped. And I think there's a couple of flaws in the design that cause that to happen. But I think there are some things you can do to mitigate that. Let me show you what I mean. You can see in the puck itself, a kind of divot in the middle, a kind of soft spot of divot here where it feels like the pressure has kind of dug a hole in the middle of the puck. And I don't think that does good things for flavor when that happens. And it seems like, as the pressurized water is pushed through the shower screen, it's more concentrated at the middle and it's kind of digging a hole in the coffee that way. I also think that the basket itself, the design isn't great. I don't think the holes are problematic, but there is quite a large area where there aren't that many holes. Let me clean this out and I'll show you. If you look in this now empty basket, you'll see that there's a little sort of logo stamped right in the middle in an area right in the center of the basket where there are now no holes because there's this logo kind of stamped in the middle. And I don't think that's ideal, especially when you've got a kind of tunnel of pressure coming from above. I don't really know what it's doing to the flow, but it, for me, has not been ideal as an extractor of coffee. That's, like I said, it's not bad. What you can do to mitigate that, though, is what's called a paper sandwich. Now, before I set that up, what I will say is, cleaning this is relatively easy. It knocks out pretty easily. But often, I would use something like a little towel to wipe the inside of a basket out. In this case, it really seems to collect coffee around the edges of the rim. It's kind of hard to see, but you go in there with your finger after you wipe it out and you'll find some. So this really needs a rinse after every use in order to get rid of everything here and then a dry wipe to make sure it's nice and dry and clean again when you're done with that, before you prep the next puck. So these are the papers we're gonna use for our little filter paper sandwich. These are designed to be used at the bottom of espresso baskets. If you want a video about how I make espresso and all that stuff, that's also up here, you can watch it if you wanna know more about that. Anyway, we're gonna awkwardly press one to the bottom of this thing here. And by placing it over the basket, we prevent issues with clogging of the holes, and we sort of ease flow through the coffee bed in a way that the basket itself sometimes restricts. So that will help with evenness quite a lot. Then, coffee on top. A little distribution and then a paper on top. Now, the paper on top is going to essentially protect the coffee from aggressive water. It will prevent that kind of channeling happening a little bit. It is a little awkward and we've added a little bit of cost to our espresso because those papers are not free and they cost money. And we've added time and complexity. But we should get a more even flow, a better flow from the finer grind. It'll flow a little quicker, which is good, and should taste much, much better. What you get, I mean, it looks pretty good. Not true espresso if you know what to look for, but much closer. And that's a kinda lungo-style thing. It's a three-to-one ratio. It's about three times more liquid than the coffee I started with. I would say for lighter roasts, this is essential as a ratio. I think with dark roasts, you could go shorter and have more of a ristretto-style thing. But for a good extraction, I haven't had much success at under three-to-one ratios. It's a much better shot. Texture's very nice, it's still got some nice body, it's got some sweetness, it's got some sort of heft to it a little bit more. It's a pretty light roast. You know, it's not in the sort of medium to dark end of espresso. It's at the lighter end of espresso. But that's a better extracted shot. I wouldn't be unhappy with that if I was served it in a cafe. You can taste the temperature's a little bit low, and I wish there was a way for this to brew a little bit hotter. I think that would sweeten things up a little bit, maybe two, three more degrees at the start. That would really help. But it's not bad. Let me clean up so we can talk about this and also Kickstarter again in a bit more depth. So that, I think, is a fair summation of my time pulling shots with the COFFEEJACK, and it's been interesting and it's been kinda fun to use. I hope that they make another one. I hope that they evolve this product into something else. And that's because they now know what it is to deliver a project of this level of complexity. Because if there's one takeaway from this video, outside of the COFFEEJACK, that I want you to sort of have, it's that when you assess a Kickstarter, that's the question. Has this company ever delivered a project of this complexity before? If you looked at COFFEEJACK, they did have a track record of delivering on their Kickstarters, but none of those previous projects had anything like the level of complexity of this. We've talked many times on this channel about just how hard hardware manufacture is, especially at the beginning, the first time you do it. This is not an isolated phenomenon to coffee or to COFFEEJACK. Even Fellow, a company with a track record of delivering relatively complex products, did struggle when they did their first grinder, the Ode. It wasn't flawlessly delivered, and that's understandable. Getting this stuff right is really hard, because until you've done it, you don't know what you don't know. You go into it full of optimism, full of hope. You know what the challenges probably are, but there's a bunch of stuff that you don't yet know about. But if they did it again, I guarantee it would flow so much more smoothly, so much more quickly, and I don't think they'd have the same level of issues. And so, it's tricky. The entire nature of Kickstarter is, here's a massive discount because we don't know what's gonna happen and how it's gonna go. That's not the nicest way of putting it, but I got something that's worth 150 pounds for 69 pounds. I had to wait three years for it, but I got it and it works and I can tweak it and make it do what I want to. And that's not a bad deal. At 69 pounds, this I think is great value for money. At 150 pounds, plus 30 for the tamper, plus 45, 50 for the stand, well, then you're up against things like the Flair PRO, which I think is a more capable, if less portable, espresso maker. But I understand why it costs what it costs. This, compared to something like the Picopresso, feels way more premium. It's solid, it's sturdy, it feels built to last. The Picopresso feels plasticky, and that's occasionally useful. It probably has better thermal retention than this thing does. But it doesn't feel quite as nice. Then it depends what matters to you. But now, I really, really wanna hear from you. Have you got one of these? Did you get one? Are you a Kickstarter backer? Tell us of your experience. I'm sure you went through some frustration. I think that's a given. Now that you've got it, are you getting on with it? Are you brewing often? Did you end up getting something else while you were waiting? I will say, I've actually used a couple of these units, and one, this one here in my hands, has been a little bit more consistent and has made better tasting coffee than the other one.", "videoID": "hnSUFXfRddE"}, {"title": "The Kafatek Monolith Flat Max (Episode #5)", "text": "Welcome to episode five of the Ultimate Grinder Showdown. We've been taking these five grinders through their paces, one review every day and it will culminate in a big head-to-head showdown covering lots of stuff around espresso, filter coffee, taste, all of that good stuff. And today, we're gonna be looking at this. It's the Monolith MAX, the best named grinder so far. And you look at it, you can see why it's called the Monolith. Now, this grinder, I paid full price for, like all the other grinders here, and it's $3,250 which makes it one of the most expensive grinders here. As disclosure, though, these operate on a pre-order only. So they open up pre-orders very briefly, everyone scrambles to try and get an order in and then they close them. I was not able to get a MAX on pre-order, I was able to get something else, but they upgraded my order to a MAX for this review. Let me give you a little background on KafaTek, the company behind the Monolith. The company, I think, dates back to 2012, but this grinder as a project dates back to 2014 and it's been through several iterations along the way. Now, inside of this grinder, I will say that there are the latest set of custom-made burrs designed by Denis, the founder of KafaTek, they're called Shuriken, the sort of burr sets that he creates. And these are called the Shuriken Sweet, which is very interesting. But before we get into pulling a shot, let's just have a quick walkthrough of what's going on with this grinder here. Starting over on this side here, you'll see there's a little controller. That is an RPM controller because once again, we've got a variable RPM grinder. This runs up to a max RPM of 500, which is much, much, much lower than most of the other grinders here that can run at higher RPMs. It'll go all the way down to five, but again, that's not really a viable RPM to be using day-to-day. I've been running at 350 as was recommended to me. This control box is doing all of that motor control, but your motor is here angled sideways, which is kind of nice, the angling here, running up to the burr set here, coffee in, coffee out. Now, the design feels not quite utilitarian, but it feels more like function-first. And that appeals to a lot of people. I quite like how this looks as a whole. The quality of build feels very solid. It's not too heavy to be annoying, but it's solid. It's not really going anywhere on your countertop. It feels very tightly sort of machined. All the tolerances are very, very nice. It's been enjoyable to use. Now, as is custom, let's quickly talk through some of the accessories that come with these grinders. We'll start with a disappointing thing. This is the dosing cup for you would weigh your coffee beans into and it's a little bit cheap in comparison to some of the other pieces here. And it doesn't really fit with the wider aesthetic of the grinder. This custom-made dosing funnel that you would put on top of your portafilter does feel quite nice. It does have a small flaw to me in that the way it sits is with this piece inside the basket. And it's really designed for 58mm baskets. When you pull it out, it does feel like it leaves a little gap around the edge, and that's easily gotten rid of, but it's not something that I particularly love about this. But otherwise, it's a very nice little funnel. It comes with a spray bottle. And I think the Monolith was one of the first grinders to start shipping with a spray bottle. It also comes with a distribution tool, and this one, it's okay. It does the job of breaking up clumps. It's not a particularly fine needle point here, but it still works quite well. It's not my favorite, but it's a nice little tool. And then it does come with a set of bellows. And these would go on top here, once you've sort of started grinding, and you would use it like that to blow through a little air to help clear any ground coffee from inside the burr chamber. So it's not bad, it works quite well. It is a material, it's a rubber that does pick up dirt relatively easily, but overall, a nice little collection of accessories. Now, this is an espresso-first kind of grinder. And you can tell that, one, because it's back to portafilter forks. These are pretty easy to adjust. There's two screws here that would change the width of them to accommodate whatever portafilter you have and make sure it holds them quite tight. I would make sure you have a pretty snug fit. Otherwise you can have a little vibration causing the portafilter to fall out. And you can adjust the height here and here to have it be lower or higher as you desire. The grind runs from zero round to 10, though espresso, generally speaking, is in this sort of section of the grinder over here. You can go past 10, you can go coarser that way. And if you're brewing filter coffee, you would certainly want to do that. But from a design perspective, from a use perspective, it is espresso first. Let's make some coffee. The idea that I might take off this piece here to brush it out to make sure I've got every scrap of coffee out of this grinder is new to me, but after a little while, I kind of enjoyed that slightly slower process around prepping espresso. And this exit chute attached by a magnet, innovation, I think was first seen on a Monolith. I've had a lot of very nice espresso from this grinder. And stylistically, it is more of a unimodal-style espresso, where you're having plenty of extraction, clarity, sweetness, all of that stuff, not a ton of texture. I sometimes wonder whether calling the burrs Sweet has put an idea in my head, but shots have been sweet, tasty, enjoyable, but again, I am working with relatively light espresso roast, sort of light to medium espresso roast anyway, but the shots, very delicious. When it comes to filter coffee though, I do have a couple of little frustrations beyond the fact that there isn't an obvious sort of solution for dosing into something for filter coffee. This feels very espresso forward, and the grind sort of range is an additional frustration for me there because by the time I'm brewing for filter, I've moved my little marker past the 10 point. Now, I know what some people have done is put an additional sticker on the adjuster so that as they move it past that point, that comes into range here. And so their filter sticker, they might know that goes to two for a V60 or four for a two-cup or something like that. But then they know the other one when they come back that they're around three for espresso. That's a nice little hack, it's neat, it's very effective. I just wish it wasn't necessary on a grinder that's this expensive that is capable of brewing great filter coffee. And my other complaints about it, and I get to complain about everything 'cause that's just who I am, are relatively minimal. It is slow, and sometimes frustratingly slow. And you could argue if that's gonna yield me better-tasting espresso, that's probably okay. And I'll, to some extent, accept that. I know we need to do more work on RPM in a future video and how that impacts flavor and other stuff. This piece here, it's actually a separate piece. It's a little funnel that prevents anything popcorning and bouncing back out again. I just wish this funnel piece here was a little bit steeper. I've found that occasionally, especially when you've sprayed the beans, you can get a little bit of stickage here where beans just don't wanna fall in and you've gotta just poke them in like that. So I would just change this little angle here on this funnel if it were me, otherwise, it's a very nice piece. Now, if you wanna access those large burrs, it's a little bit of work. You can see you're gonna need tools to get in here. So it's not gonna be something you're gonna do every day. You can get a bit of access by sort of taking this piece off and going in through the funnel here and giving it like a bit of a brush out if you want to, but it's not meaningful in terms of actually getting into the burr chamber. Now, this isn't something I would necessarily change. I just generally prefer grinders where it's easier to access the burr set here. This piece is a little spout, is a little access spout, is very neat, very simple, and I like that a lot. But in terms of componentry, the actual box that controls your RPM doesn't feel in keeping with the rest of the unit. The unit is very heavy, very solidly made. This is, I suspect, a third-party component, something brought in and placed inside, but it just doesn't feel as nice. It's pretty easy to use. You just use your dial to choose your desired RPM, and you push the button in to save that RPM. From a usability perspective, it's great. I just wish it felt just a little bit nicer like everything else on here does. And again, this box is a big box and I like having it under the machine. I like this integration of everything here, but it does give you a certain kind of boxy aesthetic and a kind of funny proportion sometimes. But I understand that this is constrained by the size of the components inside. It can be a little bit messy. The bellows here often blow a little bit of coffee around onto the forks here and onto the base unit here. It's easy and exposed and simple to clean, but it is a touch messy compared to some of the other grinders. But I don't think the worst, necessarily, but worth noting. Overall, I like this grinder a lot. I like the results from it a lot. I like using it a lot. The workflow works pretty well for me. Yes, there's some nicer accessories with other grinders, but from a shot perspective, from a brewed coffee perspective, I think it does very well. And it'll be interesting to see how it stacks up against the other four grinders in the big head-to-head coming tomorrow. I'm very excited to get into the tasting and really compare and contrast side-by-side. Now, I don't get to keep this unit. This goes to one of my Patreon supporters because Patreon gives me a budget every month to buy these things, like a normal person, not get freebies or loaners or discounts from manufacturers. And then I can give you honest, unbiased opinions. I'll miss it and I'll miss all of them.", "videoID": "MHZdX7WtdWc"}, {"title": "The Horror of Aldi\u2019s Espresso Martini Cheese", "text": "I don't want to make this video, but I feel like I have to. I feel like Aldi have played me like a fiddle. They've made this. They've got a lot of press for this as well. It's Wensleydale cheese, but it's not. It's espresso martini Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese. And I, for one, am horrified. Look, we're gonna eat it. We're gonna eat the cheese, I feel like I have to eat the cheese. I don't know why Aldi hate coffee, or me, or you, potentially, but I don't know. I'm nervous, because, well, let me tell you what's inside the cheese. 'Cause you're probably thinking, \"How do you make an espresso martini cheese?\" That's a very good question. I don't know the answer to that technically, but I'll just read the ingredients list to you. So it is Wensleydale cheese, 82%. I feel already Peter Sallis is turning in his grave. - Wensleydale? - Next ingredient, butterscotch crisp pieces. Now look, I'm not against the cheese with inclusions. It's not for me, I just like cheese to be cheese, but butterscotch crisp pieces is a surprise. Let's move on. We've got some fructose. Why would you put fructose in this? This is so weird. Coffee liqueur, which is composed of sugar, water, alcohol, and coffee extract, good. And vodka. This cheese is 2% vodka. I guess that makes an espresso martini. Color, ammonia caramel, the most delicious of all the caramels, and the preservative is potassium sorbate, which is something I don't have a strong opinion on. It looks kind of gross, to be honest. It's not a good kind of brown cheese. There is good brown cheese in the world, and I'm generally not into sweet cheese, but the kind of Scandinavian brown cheese, I'm here for that. But this is a different kind of sweet brown cheese. And that just sounds wrong, doesn't it?  It is sweating. Let me see if you can see this. It's a sweaty cheese. Hmm. Let me get my cheese board, 'cause I need to put this on something in a minute. I did also bring a cheese knife, and as a French-made cheese knife, I'm sure that this is horrified that this is, you know, how its day is going, but you know. Look at that. This is like a festive special. And I just imagine like, \"Hey everyone, I brought cheese,\" and you put this on the plate. This is your contribution to Christmas? Maybe it's good. The butterscotch pieces, I can't really see them. There's like little holes and stuff here. This really doesn't smell of anything. Now this thing is, I think, 10% sugar. That's about as sweet as a sort of soft drink. You know, it's a 9.7 grams per 100 grams come from sugars, so my instinct to let this warm up to room temperature will only encourage the sweetness, and I'm not sure I want to do that. Let's have a little slice. That's a beautiful, perfect slice. Let's go for a chunkier slice. Let's feel ambitious, come on. Are you gonna cut nicely? No, not really. No, you're not. Okay. Oh, you can sort of see, I think, what must be the butterscotch pieces here. Now you might think I should get some crackers or something like that, some Carrs Water Biscuit, I think the blandest and therefore the finest textural accompaniment to cheese, but I feel like, look, we're just gonna have to go straight. I'm genuinely nervous. I like cheese. I just don't know... Who thinks coffee and cheese is a good idea?  I'm going to have another bite. I have opinions forming, I promise you that. I like cheese. I like hard cheeses, I like soft cheeses. This isn't hard cheese or a soft cheese. It's a wet cheese, and that's not good. That's just, it's got this texture for eating that is just wet. Like, the inclusion of the espresso martini has made the texture very bad. The coffee taste, some might say thankfully, really pretty minimal. It's still mostly cheese. It doesn't do like a horrible coffee finish. The biggest betrayal here, in a way, is the inclusion on the packet of the words butterscotch crisp pieces, because there are no crisp pieces here. There are wet butterscotch pieces that are just sort of a slight soggy textural variation on the wet cheese. That is about as appealing as it sounds. It's a weird decision to include something that is that damp-tasting, I guess. Nothing here is good. The acidity of the cheese is like a medium-ish. Like, it's got some acidity. The sweetness isn't particularly overpowering, considering how much sugar's in there, I guess, 'cause it's still cold. But the flavor, I don't get it. I don't really get what they're going for here. I'm gonna have one more piece. It mostly tastes of cheese, not particular interesting cheese, to be honest. And then it has this sort of dirtiness with it. You wouldn't tell that it's about 1% alcohol, unsurprisingly I don't think this exists for any reason other than to get idiots like me to taste it and talk about it, to get newspapers to write about it, to get people in store. Why would you make that? I mean, I like to think I've answered why. All right, Aldi. You know, weirdly, I feel like you win just from me doing this. I feel like you win. I have been played. You win this round. I really don't like it and I wouldn't recommend you buy it. And I wouldn't even recommend you buy it as a kind of novelty gift to be like, \"Tee-hee, isn't this disgusting? Let's all hang out and eat it,\" unless you enjoy unpleasant textural experiences as much as unpleasant flavor experiences. 'Cause the wetness of the cheese is really hard to get over for me. Like, it eats in a kind of really claggy, damp, unpleasant way. You know, I just, no. No. Who thinks coffee and cheese is a thing? I'm genuinely curious. I know it exists in certain Scandinavian countries, but really, coffee and cheese, I'm not, I'm just, I'm not sure I'm here for it. Let me know if I'm wrong. Let me know if I'm wrong. If you have a strong coffee and cheese opinion, I want to hear from you down in the comments below. If you have been sucked into trying this like me, you know, commiserate with me in the comments down below, too. If you work at Aldi and you worked on this product, well done. You know, not 'cause it tastes good, but because it's just ridiculous and you managed to make people buy it and eat it and I think that's kind of hilarious. All right, I'm done. I'm done. Simple rating: it is a wet, slightly dirty-tasting cheese of questionable origin. I know it's Wensleydale. It doesn't taste like Wensleydale.", "videoID": "W2cIOOG4ImE"}, {"title": "The Most Wonderfully Absurd Coffee Brewer Ever Made", "text": "Hi, there. You've probably got some questions. Why am I in the woods? What is a Bripe and why, why am I wearing a fake beard? The answer to all of those is coming. There's not really a good answer to any of them, really, other than I kind of want to have some fun. Now, the Bripe is a product that I saw a little while ago. It's a brew pipe, it's a coffee brew pipe. And I looked at the website and I thought that, that is a very good joke. That, that you've got us, as the industry, Like you, you have mocked us nicely. That is very funny. And then I was like, oh no, wait, it's actually a thing. And I tried to buy one and they didn't respond to any of my emails. So I thought, okay, no, it's a joke. It's a joke. Maybe it's not a joke. It turns out it's not a joke. It's a real product and I think it is gloriously absurd. And so I needed to make a video that equaled the intensity of the glorious absurdity, which is why I'm wearing a beard. Plus I've always wanted to know what I would look like in a beard. And I know this isn't like a perfect match, but the gray beard just made me look like Santa and we're not doing, we're not doing Santa in the woods making coffee, 'cause that's just getting weird. Let's get on topic. Let's talk about the brew pipe, the Bripe. What a tremendous name, what an absurd thing. I just can't, I just can't get over the fact that this exists. I love that this exists. And, and today, just know I'm having some fun. The idea is not mockery, other than, you know, of myself. I just wanted to have some fun. This is the Bripe. It's a pipe, it's a metal pipe. And inside is actually a little filter that will filter out your grounds when you're drinking through the pipe mechanism. And the way you make a coffee with a Bripe is really simple. You put coffee in first, you put water in, and then you heat it up. You let it steep and cool down again, and then you drink it. And that's it. That's the whole thing. And it's just amazing. Now, before we go any further, I probably, I'm just going to have to take the beard off. I'm going to de-beard myself. I wish I could grow facial hair, I'd have such fun. All right, moving on. Hi, there. It's me. So let's just quickly talk about what you get when you spend money on a Bripe. So obviously you get your brew pipe and stand. You get a blue flame lighter that you're gonna use to cook this up, and it's terrifying. You get a very nice felt carry case, and you get your thermometer. That's very important. They recommend you stir with this. And then you get this, which is a test tube. A kind of plastic test tube that you you're gonna use to store your ground coffee, because, you're not weird. You're not taking a hand grinder with you. You're just briping. You're just going to take a test tube of coffee like a normal person. And so this actually is quite useful, because getting coffee into the Bripe is quite tricky. But then, so is getting coffee into the test tube. So I don't know if there's really a win there. Anyway, you get, you get a test tube. I'm going to hand grind some coffee. Because it's ultimately an infusion brew, I'm going relatively fine. Just sort of pour over, a single cup pour over kind of fine. There's probably no rules here. I definitely feel that there's no rules with the Bripe. But we'll do that. You don't need a lot of coffee. I've been brewing like five/six grams at a time in my, in my little Bripe. I don't know how much water goes in, 'cause we're in the woods. Who's weighing water in the woods? Not this guy. Now I suspect you could go for a much higher dose, if you wanted to have a more intense Bripe. I'm, I'm going for quite a gentle Bripe. It's my, it's my second Bripe of the day, so I don't wanna overdo it. Now this goes in, and as I said, loading the Bripe: not the easiest thing in the world. And that sort of is to the top of the dome, if you didn't want to weigh things. I brought some fresh filtered water from home. We're going to fill this up just to the top, just below the top, right there. Let's not make our lives complicated. And then it recommends giving it a little stir with your thermometer, just to de-clump anything. Lovely. We're nearly ready for the fun bit. We take our blue flame lighter. She's very angry. And we begin to heat the Bripe, holding onto our cork handle, keeping ourselves nice and safe. And we're heating up to 185 degrees Fahrenheit. 'Cause this is an American brewer and that's, the gauge is on here, and I'd expect nothing less than Fahrenheit. This, you couldn't Bripe in metric. So we've gone up to about 80. It's not the quickest process in the world, but imagine you go through a fair bit of butane. You can see on one side of the brewer that the heat is not very evenly dispersed and I've got a bit of boiling going on here, 'cause I'm actually at 180. There we go. Let it come up to 185. So now we give it one more stir, just to help those grounds settle, get everything in. And so now we wait. It's infusing, it's steeping, it's brewing in its pipe. Is it briping? Or am I briping? Are we both briping? So I'll put this down, and relax for a minute, you know? All right. We've, we've adequately cooled. Just gonna put my thermometer down, 'cause I'm ready to Bripe. Now this isn't the first time I've Briped. I've Briped before. This is, you know, you can't do your first time on camera. Cheers. I will say, whatever has happened for some reason, my first sip has always been a bit gritty with the Bripe. I don't really understand why. It seems like some of the grounds get behind the little screen, so that first sip: little gritty, not bad. Let's go in for number two. Mmm. It's a nice Bripe. Like it's, it's look, we followed the rules. It's a, it's a little under extracted for me because this is quite a light roast of coffee. And, and we, we were brewing at like 80 ish Celsius. So really I would have wanted to take this kind of coffee up much hotter, and, and you'd get a better brew, but you'd be missing the point. You're going to be weighing your water next. And you know what I mean? Like that, that's just not, this is not what the Bripe stands for. This is kind of the antithesis of how I make a coffee. And for that reason, I love it. Could you imagine you and a group of friends go hiking and you know, there's one other coffee friend there and you get to the top and he busts out his AeroPress and he's brewing like an awkward AeroPress, weighing the water, and it's all a bit difficult. And you, just rocking a Bripe, sitting back, relaxing, puffing away on your Bripe, enjoying the view. Now, what is interesting is you get to the bottom of this. You'd expect it to almost get siltier. But I think what's starting to happen is you have this kind of self filtering bed where the bed of coffee sat at the bottom is beginning to trap particles in it more effectively. So actually, you can drain this dry and it's not silty. It's quite enjoyable to just finish a Bripe and you feel like you're, you know, drinking a bubble pipe or something, but  Every drop. Every drop of goodness. This appeals to you or it really doesn't. And either one is okay, I, I think this is fun. I really do think this is fun. In summary, this is actually a capable brewer, right? There, there's a long history of putting coffee and water together and heating it up and and sort of straining it out and drinking it, right? Like that's not new. That's the oldest way of making coffee that we still use today. This, if you put good coffee in it, if you put good water in it, if you grind your coffee fresh, makes great tasting coffee. Of course it does. Why wouldn't it make great coffee? That's not the point. The point is to have some fun and I have had some fun. And as I said, when I review things, I give them away, but I'm not gonna give this one away.", "videoID": "tltBHjmIUJ0"}, {"title": "The Ultimate Hand Grinder Showdown", "text": "Welcome to \" The Ultimate Hand Grinder Showdown.\" Today, we're gonna look at a bunch of high-end hand grinders and talk about which one I think might be the best one of them, a note before we begin, there are a couple of notable exceptions. First and foremost is the Lyn Weber HG-1 that did not make it into this testing because it's $1,000 dollars and I just didn't really feel comfortable spending that money, it's $1,000 dollars. Secondly, a lot of people had requested the Feld 2 from Made by Knock, that was out of stock as were a couple of other grinders that people requested. So here's what we have, we have the Lido 3, we've got the Comandante C40, we've got the Helor 101, we've got the Timemore Chestnut, we've got the Aergrind from Made by Knock, we've got the Kinu M47 and joining the testing is the Porlex Mini that won the first round, which was the best cheap hand grinder. So I brought it forward into this round, to see how it stacks up, how does it compare to the other grinders? At this point, I do have to say thank you to my supporters on Patreon who made this possible, who gave me the budget to go out and buy these things and I really look forward to giving them away again. I thank you so much, this is so cool. I'm aware you've kind of ruined me, I am gonna be unnecessarily fussy about everything. Now, you know, when you get nothing but really good things to compare side by side, suddenly things that wouldn't normally bother you become horrific, outrageous, disgraceful. So I'm gonna seem unnecessarily fussy, that's just the nature of having a bunch of really nice things to compare, you just end up nitpicking, that said, let's get into how I tested these, so I did wanna make sure that they could all make espresso, so I dialed them in for espresso each and every one and took copious notes along the way, as well as did a bunch of tastings with that, what I will tell you is that first and foremost, dialing in seven hand grinders across multiple coffees for espresso is very unpleasant, I do not recommend that whatsoever, it took me a long time and I had very sore arms. I'm not sure I'd recommend hand grinding for espresso. I know some people out there like it, so it was necessary to test all of these to see how they would do and they all could brew espresso. What I also did for filter testing, was I brewed them all until they all were extracting at a 30 gram to 500 grams of water ratio, till they were all extracting about 21%, very small margin of error, I dialed them in as closely as I could, they would then taste it to see if there was a big difference. So I wanted to push these just a little bit coarser. The finer they are, the more uniform they're likely to be, if you give them a little bit more coarseness, then flaws in the burrs will start to show up a little bit more, alongside that, I then took samples of the grounds and had a look at them using some free software, I recently provided by Jonathan Gagne, he is an astrophysicist by day, and someone who's writing some amazing software for coffee people, I'll link it down below it lets you take a photograph of the grounds and ultimately analyze the size of those particles based on the number of pixels that they occupy and give you a distribution of ground profile. So that was the testing and I've ground by hand, I don't know how many kilos now but enough that I don't particularly wanna do it anymore, but it was fascinating, so what I'm gonna do now, is I'm gonna jump into each individual grinder and talk through a little bit of that grinder and then at the end, I will kind of wrap up with a summary of which one I think I would wanna keep, that's gonna be the metric right? Which one will be the saddest to give away, because it's the one I would most want to keep. Let's start with the Lido 3. So first up is the Lido 3 from Orphan Espresso and goodness me, this thing is huge, like it's huge. I have no idea why it's as big as it is and to be honest, this was a big negative for me, I don't want a grinder this big, there are certainly other grinders with much smaller form factors delivering everything you would want, I confess that from the beginning, that did bother me a little bit, now it means you have an enormous capacity, you could probably get 60, 70 grams of beans in this thing. Now it does become slightly more compact, you can lift and move the handle into the middle so it's sort of slimmer and I suppose easier to travel with but that's not an enormous space saving if I'm honest. So it is plastic bodied, there's a large burr set inside it and it is a stepless grind adjuster. So here's how it works, there's a grind indicator at the top, there is a locking ring and then there's your grind adjustment. So right now the locking ring is compressed against the grind adjustment, so I can't change my grind. If I unlock my locking ring and I can now adjust my grind as needed, I can go finer or I can go coarser and then I can lock my grinder back at that setting, as a kind of UI, I don't particularly love this feeling, I don't like sort of locking the ring against this, it just didn't feel pleasing to me, that may be different for you, but for me, I just didn't really enjoy adjusting the grind on this thing, it is a wonderfully quick grinder, those are big burrs inside of it and they definitely chew through coffee at a pretty fast rate, which meant grinding for espresso was pleasurable, the shot it pulled was pretty good. Like just about every grinder after it, I might as well say now, all of their shots start pretty slow, and then really flow very quickly in the last half of the espresso, which was kind of interesting to me when it came to brewing coffee, I did enjoy the brew that it produced. It was a little finicky to get there, but it was quick to grind at least, it's 180 pounds and for that I'm a little disappointed at the amount of plastic in this thing, it doesn't feel as premium as some of the other grinders at the same sort of price point. The bean hopper is relatively well designed, there's no issues with bounce out, where you're gonna put coffee in and the beans hit the stabilizing pieces and bounce back out again, which does happen with the other grinders sometimes. So overall, yeah, pretty impressed, it's a solid grinder, it does a good job for the money, I don't love the size or the form factor, I don't particularly enjoy the grind adjustment on it, but its actual delivery of ground coffee, is pretty good. And now, Commandante C40, Commandante really kind of kick started the high-end grinder thing there had been expensive hand grinders before them, but I think Commandante were the first ones to turn up, push grind quality at a higher price, push a high-end experience, they really paved the way for a lot of premium hand grinders behind them, it's a beautiful thing, it does feel very well made, it does feel very premium with one exception, the little plastic piece here attached to the crank handle, I don't love this actually, I don't love that the lid is attached to the crank handle, that kind of bothers me a little bit. It does also have a pretty high stabilizing point and loading this can result in a little bit of bounce out where you're just pouring coffee beans in and a couple hit this and bounce back out again. It's really really annoying when it happens 'cause coffee beans are very irritating once they're outside of a place you want them to be like the counter or the floor or anywhere really, obviously you need these pieces here to stabilize the driveshaft through this thing. The grade adjustment is pretty simple, there's a coarser, finer dial here, you do need to make sure that your lid is on otherwise you can't really adjust it, it is a stepped grinder, I think there is a mod to give you a bit more control over that if you find these steps a little bit too big, they weren't too big for me, I didn't have a particularly difficult time dialing in for espresso, it was a pretty limited range to dial in with, but I hit my shot times my ratio that I wanted to and the shot was very good. It was probably my favorite shot, other testers liked another grinder a little bit more but I really liked the espresso from this again in the brewed testing, it produced a very delicious cup of coffee relatively easily, the steps got me where I needed to go relatively easily again, it's clearly a good burr set in there and the grind analysis shows it's pretty good, it does have a glass collection chamber, it's the only one though that I tested that had a glass collection chamber and during testing, I did drop this on a hard floor it didn't break 'cause it's well made, but it did make me think, I'm not sure I want this to be glass 'cause I'm clumsy. You can definitely tell when it's getting dirty quicker than you can with the other ones, breakable things stress me out, especially with something you're gonna travel with, something you might have just rolling around in a bag full of stuff, that crossed my mind. I don't think I've seen many people break these or heard complaints about it but it crossed my mind overall you could argue this is kind of the gold standard of hand grinders, they really set the bar where it is, they set it pretty high, I really enjoyed this thing, I was impressed by the quality of coffee that it produced start to finish, it's a really nice grinder. This is the Helor 101 and it is beautiful. It's really beautifully machined. So again, the handle is connected to a lid, the lid in this case is metal. This is a sort of a unibody piece, it's all kind of milled out and it is lovely. There is a little grippy ring here which was okay to use, the grounds collection bin is a friction connection, which is nice, it's a nice solid little grounds bin. So the ground adjustment is at the bottom here, it is stepless unlike some of the others that have a ground adjustment at the bottom, which is a very nice to use. So you need to make sure your handle's attached to make that adjustment, I was very impressed by this grinder, it is again relatively expensive but not by any stretch, the most expensive, I think it's very good I like the design, I think it's beautiful. The adjustment was good, the shots I had were good, the brewed coffee I had was also good, it seems to perform pretty well in grinds analysis. This is a very strong grinder, it does look fantastic. Do I have any downsides? Yeah, a couple. Again, the stabilizer is relatively high up, I just have a little bit of bounce out there and if I'm to be truly nitpicky, this little bowl should spin as you crank the handle, but it was quite sticky and it often wouldn't and it was a bit frustrating, it's gotten better with use, which indicates that something just didn't quite fit the way it was supposed to and is wearing down to the point that it does, but occasionally it sticks and that's annoying, it doesn't feel superb and you want these things to feel fantastic. Quick to grind, enjoyable to use, the lack of guidance on the grind adjustment is a little frustrating, but not a huge problem. They do give you a reference in terms of burr movement for I think a 30 degree turn on their website, it's a very good grinder, it may be ended up feeling a little mid pack, it does everything very well but it doesn't really stand out in a really big way against some of its competition but if you want a grinder that looks like this, that produces very good tasting coffee, I was impressed by this. And this is the Timemore grinder, the Chestnut grinder, I probably made a mistake, I ordered this with the wooden base, the more premium one, it's the more expensive one than the clear base that is an option and upon using it, it kind of it, I don't like it, it doesn't feel right to grind coffee into a little wooden chamber, I find that really hard to explain why when I say it out loud, but something about it just unsettles me it feels like something that's gonna get dirty in a way that's gonna be really hard to clean, if you're coating the inside of this with coffee oil all the time, well that might not be good but there is an option, you don't have to get it with the chestnut base from the beginning, this thing, this piece has a little magnet so it clicks on but it would often come off, I don't think the magnet connection is quite strong enough for me so grinding sometimes I did whip the handle piece off that was quite irritating, on the plus side it is a very fast grinder, it does grind very quickly. Whether that's the way that they're feeding the beans in or not, I'm not sure, again the lid is attached to the handle and here the stabilizing piece is a little bit deeper though it is quite a narrow grinder to load into, which was okay, that was fine. A couple of things that I didn't like as much with this grinder, now, one thing I really, really didn't like about this was that the way that this bottom piece connects on, there are four little ball bearings and little springs that compress in, clicks into place, but it was really easy to sort of break that connection during grinding, I have quite large hands, which means it's easy for me to want to hold the grinder on both the base and the main body and if I did that, it was easy, very easy to just disconnect that and it wasn't that it fell off ever, it never did, it just feels really unpleasant to hold it like that, to have it sort of slip and move around when you're trying to grind, I didn't like that at all. It made pretty good filter coffee but when it came to espresso, it is a stepped grind adjustment again, and the steps were very big, I had very large changes in my flow rate from a single step, finer or coarser, and it was pretty difficult to dial in, I got there, the shot was okay but the steps were pretty big. There's things I like about this, the way that it grinds feels very good but there's a few things that just really frustrate me, so it's not a grinder I'd recommend for espresso particularly. I definitely don't like the base, I don't like the material that I chose, which is I guess my own fault, but it was the premium version, I don't like the material and I don't like the way it connects, both of those things really damaged the experience of using this thing, it just makes it a lot less enjoyable to use, quite frustrating to use, the grounds from it were good but not fantastic. Now this is the Aergrind from Knock and it's a really interesting price point, it's 100 pounds before shipping which is cheap, 99 pounds to be more precise, so it is easily the cheapest grinder here and by a good long way, it's so cheap, it probably could have gone into the cheaper grinder testing and if it had, it would have crushed the competition. This is I think spectacularly good value for money in terms of what you get from it, handled attaches from the lid and the stabilizing piece is relatively low in there so you don't have any issues with loading this thing with coffee, it is quite unusual in the way that you adjust the grind, that's quite different to everything else. So your piece goes on and what you do is hold this top piece here is this lid and if you hold the lid and move the handle, you can see there's an adjustment marker here and there's numbers here so again, going from eight, down to seven is a move finer, now, this feels just so different as a way to do things, that part of my brain is like there's no way this can work, there must be slippage. Surely, when I'm twisting this thing, that's gonna change the burr setting slippage possible. I don't think it is, and I never experienced any slippage with this thing, it struggled when we came down to espresso, right? I found it very difficult to make the adjustments necessary to really dial it in and it very quickly slipped into being too fine, that window of too coarse to too fine was actually pretty small on this grinder, you can grind very fine, you can get down to kind of Turkish on this thing, it can go very fine but it seems to me that the window of opportunity for espresso was pretty small and like some of the other grinders, it is a friction ground bin, the gasket being on here, as opposed to on the base this time, I thought this worked very well, it definitely feels very secure, perhaps sometimes a little too secure, it's quite hard work to get off, I don't know if that would change over a year or two of usage but it definitely fits very well. The grinds quality is good, it may not be as good as some of the other grinders, but at under 100 pounds, it's fantastic value for money, it's pretty small, that's definitely an issue when grinding 30 grams of coffee for my filter coffee testing, I couldn't put 30 grams of coffee into this thing, I had to load it twice which was a little bit annoying. So know that there are some limitations but overall I have to say for 100 pounds, I'm impressed, I wouldn't recommend it for espresso but as a filter grinder, it's very good if it had been in the cheaper grinder comparison, it would have crushed the competition in every single way. So, yeah, for 99 pounds, I was very impressed by this thing. At the other end of the price spectrum, we have the Kinu M47, by far the most expensive grinder that I tested, this is 329 euros, that is a lot of money. It is built like a tank, it is substantially heavier than any of the other grinders, it is really, really well made. Now there is no lid on this thing, which is interesting. The Lido doesn't have a lid and this doesn't have a lid, it does, however, have this nice little lip here and sort of half funnel. This meant loading this was an absolute pleasure, I never had any issues loading coffee into this thing, despite the fact that when you look in the top, there's a big stabilizing piece and the hole is pretty small but the design means that I never had any issue with spillage, it was a pleasure to load into, now the grind adjustment on this is particularly interesting, Kinu do something a little bit different, which is they give you steps and then they tell you what a step does, every step moves the burrs by 1/100th of a millimeter. The grind adjustment mechanism is quite simple, you have a locking piece on the top here, which you undo, and then you move your little grind adjuster lock back in the top, and you're good to go. One of the challenges of hand grinding, is that you're gripping a perfectly round thing most of the time and applying a good amount of force to that and so keeping hold of it can be an issue, slippage is a thing, some of the grinders solve that by giving you a rubber band, with some grinders you don't get that, the Commandante you don't get that so slippage is possible. The Kinu comes with quite a nice little thumb stop, which I really liked using a lot. It was pleasing to me to have my thumb against this thing as I ground coffee, it made it much, much easier to use. The base of this is also very clever, it's magnetically attached, there's a bunch of little magnets in the top here that allow it to just click in, it feels very secure when you're grinding unlike the Timemore, I'm always gonna be holding the main body of the grinder, I'm never going to be touching this, it probably would move a little bit if I were holding it down there but I'm not so it's no issue. I thought that was really well done. The capacity of this thing is not huge, it doesn't hold an enormous amount of ground coffee, but certainly enough but it just feels fantastic and when you grind coffee with it, it feels really good from the usability experience, this thing crushes it, this was incredibly enjoyable to use with the one downside of it being very, very, very heavy, much, much heavier than any of the others, which would put a dampener on me using it as a travel grinder, in terms of the shots that it produced, I had a funny experience dialing in the first time, which was, I kind of chased the grind setting around a little bit which shouldn't really happen on a hand grinder when you're grinding through everything each time and I ended up dialing it in, going in a little bit finer, having to go coarser, and kind of ending up where I was, but having quite a different flow rate. It made me wonder whether there was just a little bit of seasoning needed for the burrs, after that, it acted in a much more predictable and consistent fashion. I really enjoyed the espresso from this, some testers thought this was the best tasting espresso, as I said, I preferred the espresso from the Comandante but this produced very good espresso. It's brewed coffee was very good, I'm not sure it was absolutely the best but it was very good and very enjoyable at a 21% extraction, the grounds analysis shows it to be pretty good, with the grounds analysis, I'm not sure I have enough data across enough different coffees, across enough different ground settings to say, with any confidence that one grinder here produced the most uniform ground settings. It was interesting to look at the grounds to see the distributions, a lot of them performed very, very similarly, I really like this grinder, I do and I was impressed by it, my goodness me it's very expensive, 329 euros is a lot of money and I'm very glad that Patreon allowed me to go and buy this and test it, I've really enjoyed testing this grinder. And so we should wrap up briefly by talking about the Porlex, this went through the same testing as the others and in truth, it felt like a toy. It felt so cheap in comparison, you know the gauge of the material felt so light, it felt plasticky, the gap in price between this and the Aergrind is not particularly large, the gap in quality is substantial, this did not do well in any of the testing, quite hard work to dial in for espresso and the espresso I got from it was notably worse than the espresso from the other grinders and again, the filter coffee that I got from it was noticeably worse, muddier, dustier, so at 57 pounds, I don't think it's bad value for money, it's just not in the same league, it's not even close, it sounds like a toy, it feels like a toy in comparison to these much, much better hand grinders that we've been testing and so it's time for a summary, it's time to tell you which one I would want to take home and if I'm honest, it may not be the absolute best performing in terms of particle uniformity, but it is probably the Kinu M47, it is the one that I enjoyed using the most of all, it is outrageously expensive but you kind of see really what you're getting for your money, the grinding action is beautiful, the design is great, the bottom chamber I really like, the grind control is well thought out, the little details, for me, the cup quality was very good, that would be the one the Kinu for me is the best of these from fit, finish, build, usage, as well as having really great quality in the cup, for me, that's my favorite. I want to want to use it that's really important to me, and this definitely went in that category.", "videoID": "dn9OuRl1F3k"}, {"title": "The Eagle One", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about a project that is near and dear to my heart. That is the Eagle One. Now warning, gonna tell you right from the start. This is a project that I've been involved in for years now, from its inception. I've been incredibly involved in it. I would have been traveling the world talking about it this year. So I could not have more of a bias and you should know that now. But I think it's an interesting project and I kind of wanna talk about it, not necessarily about the machine, but about the kind of bigger why of creating something new. 'Cause that's really an interesting question. It's an interesting challenge. If you build a new machine, you start with a blank piece of paper. You can build anything you want. You can create any new technology you want. So how do you pick? How do you pick the things that are important? How do you decide? And that's kind of what I wanna cover. And all of it for me starts with something pretty simple. It starts with a design brief. A design brief for me starts with an audience, who you're building this for, and then it's about identifying a problem of theirs worth solving. To me, innovation is that, it's about solving a problem in a new way. You can create new coffee machine technology and go in search of a problem, but that's not innovation. That's more akin to me to novelty. So I'm interested in innovation. I'm interested in problem solving. I worked with Victoria Arduino on this project and I've worked with them or their parent company now for quite a long time. Nearly 10 years I think. I got involved as a kind of a late addition to the team that was developing and testing the Mythos One grinder. I then went on to work with them on the Black Eagle Nespresso machine. And this is the third project with them that I've worked on. I think the Black Eagle is are pretty good example of looking at an audience and try to pick a problem. And with that machine, the audience was the obsessives of specialty coffee. People who understood how difficult it was to do espresso incredibly well and incredibly consistently. And they were people who'd been fighting with little drip tray scales, you know, breaking them all the time, and just knowing what they needed but having an issue in being able to have it. And so the Black Eagle was very much built around let's solve that problem. Let's integrate scales into the machine. Let's have it be incredibly stable, easy to control. Let's have it look good, that's kind of part of the process too. But it was about solving a problem for that audience. What I think is interesting is that audience has changed. Specialty coffee has changed. It's everywhere now. It's in every city. It's not just a kind of London thing, Melbourne thing, Tokyo thing, New York thing. It's every city. It's most urban areas, it's small towns. Specialty has spread everywhere. And historically it had really been in consuming countries, but now, well, that's changed too. There are many producing countries that have vibrant specialty coffee cultures that are as interesting as anything anywhere in the world. So it's a much, much, much broader umbrella. The people who care about coffee, it's a much larger group. And with a larger audience, well, that's good and bad. It's unlikely that they will have shared problems. But it turns out, I think, that everyone has a little bit of a shared problem. Everyone has something worth worrying about. And I'm gonna use one word to define it. And you might roll your eyes when you hear the word, but I'll bring you back. The word is sustainability. I get it, I get it. It's an overused word. It's a word that is used to death. But I just wanna use a very basic definition of it to sort of focus on how I'm thinking about the problem. The basic definition is the ability to sustain, the ability to keep going. Is it able to perpetuate itself? And that's a challenge from a number of perspectives. Two main ones, really. The first place your brain probably went to was the environment. Our impact on the environment makes our existence on this planet unsustainable. And I'm not interested in arguing that. But there is another kind of sustainability that is very relevant to the coffee industry, and that is financial sustainability. Can the businesses that sell coffee to you every day, that do a great job, can they sustain? Are they sustainable businesses? And in both of those things, there's a common factor. We are wasteful. We are wasteful in a multitude of ways, and that impacts the environment and that impacts the health of the business that is wasteful. And I'm very interested in that particular problem, being less wasteful. And that became the big primary goal of this project, how do we become less wasteful? Now in the past we'd worked on energy efficiency, but this time around we were really able to push it forward quite a long way. Going back to the Black Eagle, the way that that thing heated water was kind of interesting. It was called a T3 system. I'll be quick about this, don't worry. You had a heat exchanger that kind of preheated the water before it went into a brew boiler. That brought it up to your desired brew temperature, let's say 94 degrees Celsius. And then the third stage of heating was actually the grouphead itself. In these machines, the physical grouphead weighs about 4 1/2 kilos, and they insulated it and put a heater inside it and a thermocouple so that would be maintained also at 94 degrees Celsius. So between the boiler and the coffee, there was no opportunity for the water to be a different temperature. And as a result you had a ton of consistency and it was a very flat line in terms of temperature. What we worked out relatively early, actually, is that the temperature of the grouphead is way more important than the temperature of the boiler. Because you've got this 4 1/2 kilos of metal, your brew water that you're actually gonna use, well, it's only maybe 70 grams of liquid. So even if it's slightly lower in temperature, it'll absorb heat from that big thermal mass of the grouphead and it'll come up to the grouphead's temperature before heating the coffee. We took this as far as we could, so we shrank the brew boiler down as small as we could. It went from being about a liter to down to like 150-200 mils. The size of those disappointing cans of Cola that you used to get on airplanes, that who was ever satisfied by those, those teeny little cans? I'm sure you'll agree, a tiny amount of liquid. And because you're not preheating the heater either, this small boiler will take it from cold to nearly perfect brew temperature and then the grouphead kind of does the rest, and you have in that a huge energy saving. But for me, one solution is not enough. You've got to look at an entire system and see where else you can maybe gain something. And there's little gains in funny places. These machines all have an auto flush. When you pull a shot, if you take the grouphead out, it will flush the exact minimum amount of water necessary to clean the screen and no more. Because I know over the years of being a barista or sort of working on coffee bars, I'll flush a grouphead between every single shot but I will get distracted sometimes and dump out way more water than I probably needed to. And over the course of 500 drinks a day you can waste staggering amounts of water. In London, that's water that you've had to pay to buy, firstly. Secondly, you've had to pay to treat through reverse osmosis which has quadrupled the price essentially. And then you've paid to heat it up, and then you've dumped it down a drain box. It's a staggering waste of energy and it's so unnecessary and this is where robots are better than people. So I love that. But we could go further still. And this one is so ridiculous, but I completely love it. We talked about the idea and then we tested it and our minds were kind of blown. Inside the drain box where all your hot water waste goes there's a heat exchanger, and it pulls the heat out of your drain box and uses it to preheat your brew water. There is no thermal waste here, or as little as possible. It turns out you can get up to 8% efficiency by doing it this way. It started out as a kind of this won't work but we should try it. Wouldn't it be fun? And it turned out to be really quite valuable. Yeah, I can't benchmark against other name brands, but against what I guess would be a popular choice it uses about 1/3 less energy to make the same number of drinks. That's really I think a good indication of what we're trying to do here and the kind of thinking here. Obviously parts inside a highly recyclable and there's been a good amount of thought on materials choice inside the machine. The one other thing I wanna talk about just quickly that I'm very passionate about as part of this machine is a kind of part of the styling. Now it's designed to look very clean, very minimal. It's designed to look good on any coffee bar. It's easy I think to build a machine with almost too much character that can look odd in a bunch of places as much as it looks perfect in a bunch of places. Really the goal here was to be as clean and as minimal and actually as small as is possible without compromising the kind of barista side experience. But more than that, people love to customize coffee machines. And I get it. It's a beautiful thing and you can make it even more beautiful with customization. The problem is you can easily end up spending 50% more of the cost of the machine on customizing it. And I don't think that's cool. I don't think it should cost a fortune to customize machines, so we've built it with customization in mind. Like the panels come off real easily, they're really easy to replace with other materials. The back panel isn't actually the back panel, so you can use almost any material there and not worry about heat or that kind of stuff. So it's built to be super easy to cheaply customize and give you a lot of flexibility about materials choices. And people are kind of using some cool stuff, some highly recycled stuff. They're already having fun with that. And there are other things that I wanna talk about. I think it's good that we've gotten rid of mechanical steam valves and then have electric solenoids. I think there's better longevity, easier to change. It's a different experience, but I think a better experience ultimately. I don't wanna get into like a specs list or a features list or that kind of stuff. I wanna talk about what we're trying to do and why I'm so concerned about that. Because even before the pandemic sustainability was and quite rightly was a big topic of discussion, and that's both environmental as well as financial. The coffee industry became a target for governments around the world, really, as a focal point of waste. You know, the paper cup wastes story ran and ran and ran all over the world. No one talks about the amount of paper waste generated by online delivery. But hey, look at coffee shops, look how messy they are. It was a concern, and it's a fair concern. I think it's disproportionate, but it's still a fair concern, but that's just one piece of that. But alongside that we were already at a point of massive financial pressure. There were way too many coffee shops around the world, that was way too much competition, and surviving was gonna be difficult. And then you laid a pandemic across that and survival became incredibly difficult for almost everyone in the market. I've said this before and it'll probably continue to be true. It's never been harder to run a coffee shop than it is now. But I want people to succeed, and so I'm very interested in working towards building tools that help businesses succeed. A machine should have everything you need to serve great coffee and kind of nothing more. It should be as efficient as possible, but you don't wanna add so many features that you start to bloat the price, because I've heard loud and clear from people in many producing countries who feel they're kind of priced out of coffee innovation. The most interesting coffee machines are often the most expensive, and that might work, that might work in London or LA or Melbourne, but maybe it doesn't work as effectively in Jakarta or Mexico City. Working kind of remotely on a project like this is interesting. I would travel to Italy occasionally and we'd look at prototypes and we'd argue about panel sizes or how to shrink a grouphead or get a display into the grouphead and have it look really good. Angles of steam ones, all of that kind of stuff. And then I would go away and they'd build things and I'd come back and it would evolve in that kind of a way. And honestly, they're doing all of the hard work. I would just come in and get to complain for a little bit and they'd be very tolerant of me and then I'd leave again and we'd continue. It's a strange journey but I'm very pleased with the result. So that's the Eagle One project. It's been a lot of fun. We launched it last year as part of Design Week in the Saatchi Gallery in London and that was a cool event to get to do. And then obviously we took it to Host in Milan where most people saw it for the first time.", "videoID": "BV506qOTkco"}, {"title": "A Rant\uff1a Espresso Ratios & Recipes", "text": "Today, we're gonna have a little bit of a rant about espresso ratios and espresso recipes. And the increasing confusion between the two and some of the problems with those things. So let's start with ratios. Ratios refer to the ratio of ground coffee at the start of your dose. Let's say you brew with 18 grams to the liquid weight of espresso. So let's say 36 grams of liquid espresso in the cup. So that's a two to one ratio. Brewing ratios go back to maybe I think around 2007, there was a load of work done on the Homeroaster forum. Particular shout out to Andy Schechter for producing some of the first kind of tables that kind of codified espresso ratios. A couple of things happened. One, it was around the time we were starting to transition from measuring espressos volume to espressos weight. And that really accelerated once refractometers came on the scene and we began to really, really understand the impact of the liquid weight in the cup and how important maintaining those ratios were. But back then, it was just kind of interesting way to talk about espresso and begin to communicate it. I think I found the first photo I took of weighing a shot and I remember being kind of stunned at the difference between the volume and the weight of that espresso. It was a ton of crema so it looked much bigger than it weighed. Now, this early work by people like Andy Schechter began to kind of describe more objectively what a Ristretto was, what an espresso was, would a Lungo might be and it was to do with these kinds of ratios. So a one to a one or a one to 1.5. That was kind of a Ristretto. A ratio of one to two was kind of espresso and a ratio say one to three was closer to a Lungo. And that was useful because it gave us some definitions. But at the same time, ratios were kind of just abstract, philosophical ideas. And they were also kind of shortcuts for descriptions of strength. A Ristretto brewed well at this ratios would be maybe 13, 14%. A Lungo, maybe six to 8%. An espresso brewed well, maybe 10%. And by that, I mean, 10% of that espresso was dissolved solids. 90% of that espresso was still water. What we've seen increasingly is roasters begin to use ratios as a way to communicate how to brew their coffee. And I know I've done it myself, thinking about it more and more, it's actually not particularly helpful. If I say brew espresso to two to one, I'm kind of just saying make espresso. Don't make a Ristretto don't make a Lungo, make an espresso. And the implication is that 18 to 36 is really just the same as 20 to 40 or 22 to 44. And that isn't the case. That isn't the case at all. They should ideally have the same strength if they've all extracted equally well but in the real world, that's, that's unlikely, because in the real world of espresso recipes, there are a whole matrix of things that go into impacting what a good recipe is going to be, the size and quality of the basket in your espresso machine is one. The quality of your grinder is another. The quality of your brewing water is another. The espresso machine itself. Then let's get into the coffee, the roast level, the altitude that it was grown, the density of it, the post-harvest process. All of these things impact how easy it is to extract that coffee. And so saying anywhere is fine. Any recipe is fine as long as it's two to one. Well, that isn't really true because if you take a light roast, very high grown washed coffee, and you have a cheap entry-level grinder and a cheap entry-level espresso machine, you don't want to be putting 20 grams of coffee into an 18 grand basket. You will have a bad time. And what we've failed to do is give, I think, better and better guidance on starting dose because that's really, that's the easiest thing. If I give you a starting dose, you can work out ending weight. Brewing times, by and large, we're somewhere in the 25 to 35 second region. Unless you're doing weird things with pre-infusion. And so some guidance there is useful, but actually this ratio, this relationship between ground coffee and liquid espresso is really super important. But ratios on their own are not enough. They're not particularly useful. You may as well say, \"Hey, here's our espresso blend. Brew it at 10% strength.\" Because by saying brew it one to two, that's the same thing. You've said the same thing. And you've said seemingly lots but also nothing at all, nothing really super useful. Now, as I said, I, I've been guilty of this. You know, it became very easy to get wrapped up in these super neat convenient recipes. And I think that the other thing we've really failed to communicate is that they are a starting point. So you wanna start from a realistic place from your setup. And I would always say, go go lower dose. Unless you need a lot of liquid espresso, set yourself up for success by starting with a lower dose of coffee. Don't start at 20. Don't start at 18. Maybe start at 16 grams, right? Unless you need a lot of liquid espresso for some reason, let's say you're making a big milk drink. Sure, you might wanna start with a lot more ground coffee, but if you, you just want a really great tasting shot, whether that's a thing 30 gram or 32 grandmas, 34 gram shot, that amount of liquid variance doesn't matter in terms of the drinking, but the quality of extraction absolutely matters to the enjoyment, to the aftertaste, to the just delightfulness of that espresso. Right. So we're gonna start, let's say at 16 grams, start with 16 to 32, but that's, that's our starting point. And you have to accept that your setup will need some tweaking and tuning. Your brew water, your grinder, all of these things mean you'll have to experiment. And Barista Hustle have a great chart for navigating, when to go finer, when to go coarser, I'll link to that down below. I'm not gonna try and reproduce their work. That's super useful, but I do just wanna say, take a ratio with a pinch of salt. Ratios are abstract, philosophical ideas that they're perfect because they're not real. They're not the real world. A recipe is the real world, but a really prescriptive recipe should also be questioned. Recipes should be starting points. You should understand why the guidance is there. I would always recommend brewing lower doses of very high grown coffees and I would do low ground coffees like a Great Estate Brazil, you can dose that up a little bit more and probably enjoy the texture that comes with those kinds of coffees brewed at a one to two or even maybe less. Now I get that there is an audience out there that just wants a simple answer that has bought the good coffee. They've got the good setup. Just give me, just give me the answer. I've got limited amount of coffee, I've got a limited amount of time, get me to good quickly. And I think by giving really prescriptive answers, we do them a disservice and the coffee that we roast and sell a disservice. And I hate that there's no easy answer, but there is no easy answer. Before I wrap up, I will say that I will, in the near future, shoot a version of this video that has to do with how I actually go about dialing in and creating a recipe for a coffee. I'll get someone to give me something with very limited information and I'll dial it in. And I'll go through the steps about what I'm thinking about, the adjustments that I'm making, why am I dropped my dose, why am I changed my grind or increase the amount of liquid in the cup? I will go through all of that, but to wrap it up, to wrap it up simply, if you're looking for guidance, understand that not all two ones are created equal and just brewing at a two to one, doesn't necessarily get you where the roaster wants you to go. And if you're a roaster or a barista trainer or someone communicating recipes, understand how limited the information you're really communicating, even by giving a really, really, really specific recipe, let's say one to one to 2.255369, that very specific, but also not at all specific whatsoever. So I think we can do better. I think we can communicate better. And I think that we're getting as an industry, potentially a little bit lazy with ratios. And so that's why I wanted to have just a little, just a little rant about that today.", "videoID": "45Ja8pJU73s"}, {"title": "First Look\uff1a New ROK GC Espresso Maker and Grinder", "text": "When I reviewed the Flair Espresso Maker, a few of you left comments asking about reviewing the ROK Espresso Maker. Now, before it even published the Flair review, coincidentally, Patrick, who is the man behind the ROK Espresso Maker, he got in touch, based in London, office here, and asked if I wanted to come by, maybe look at a unit, maybe review one. So I did, I went by the offices, we had a chat and I agreed to take away a review unit on the condition that I would get to say the truth, how I honestly felt about it. And that's what we're doing. So, I haven't paid for this, this is just on loan. But it is super interesting. Now, the ROK has been around for a while, like 20 plus years, and this is the first really big update. Now, Patrick did say something that I thought was just fantastic, which is the updates to this maker can be retro-fitted as a kit onto the first-gen ROK Espresso Makers. So, from the beginning, I have to admit he had me on side. That kind of approach as a manufacturer I really have a lot of respect for. So I thought that was super cool. And this is called the GC, which is short, I think, for \"glass composite\", which refers to the new materials you see in the top of the maker here and that's the part you look to change. They've also changed the piston piece. They've made the actual piston narrower, meaning you drive much higher pressures through that piston. Now, along with that, he did also let me have a look and a play with the new hand grinder that they have coming out, which is really quite interesting. This is a hand grinder built for espresso and there's some things about it that I think are actually very clever when it comes to grinding for espresso. And let us start here. So, what you get here, you get a little, little cup for weighing beans and then for grinding into with a little spout for dispensing into your portafilter. And then underneath here, at the bottom here you can see this is where you adjust the grind. So you would twist this little clicks for grind settings and again, it is built to go alongside this as it's built to go really pretty fine. Now, if you've tried to grind for espresso on a hand grinder, you'll know that grinding like that is incredibly hard work and the solution is actually just to have a much longer lever arm to allow more lever force and be able to do that. So, this is actually really quite nice designed to have the lever on the side, a table mounted unit and to really have like a lot of travel here. So actually grinding for espresso is physically not that demanding at all. There's a very simple gear here to allow a vertical drive shaft to drive a metal conical burr set in here. And I know a lot of people in espresso really have come to prefer flat burr profiles, but conical burrs just allow you a much larger cutting area in a smaller footprint, which is why they're so popular in things like hand grinders, just it really gives you a lot more cutting surface in that small space. So the flow of using this thing is you're gonna grind here, you're gonna weigh your beans, you're gonna grind them, we'll do that in a second, and then into the little portafilter in here, pour your water in the top, lift the arms up, push them down, and then you're making coffee. So as a workflow, not too fiddly. Well let's go on and make a shot. And now we grind. So even though I'm sat at what isn't a great angle for doing this, that actually physically wasn't particularly difficult to do and I wasn't working super quick but it felt, well pretty easy. And actually in the unit if you look inside, there's a little sort of a metal finger to help kind of feed and push beans down into the burr set, acting almost like an auger, just to sort of keep it nice and even and uniform. The grounds out of this thing are surprisingly fluffy and uniform looking. I was actually really pretty impressed by the grounds coming out of this thing. You can use it for filter coffee if you want to it'll obviously grind much faster and you just need to move the burr adjuster I think about one and a half full rotations coarser to get like a filter coffee ground, but I haven't tested it at that, that was just what Patrick told me he'd had some success with. However, at espresso, I'm pretty impressed. Now on to the ROK espresso maker. Now you can get a standard portafilter, the little plastic portafilter spouts that come with this that fit on the handle they just clip on very easily, which is good. I think they know most people would probably just want to brew a double so they're not gonna use them and they do feel just a little bit delicate, I can break them quite easily, but they clip on and off very easily and that's kind of a nice little extra, I guess. They do do naked portafilters as well if you want that in your life, which is kind of fun. So the challenge of any espresso machine that doesn't have a heating element in it where you're gonna add hot water to it, is making sure that the machine doesn't steal that heat before the water hits the coffee. And that's true of just about any one of these kind of units and this is true here. So you really really really wanna make sure that you've pre-heated your portafilter, as well as the unit itself. It's probably easiest to do those two things together. Don't put water in this and lift the arms up without a portafilter being in place, otherwise you'll just make a mess. So what I would typically do is get some hot water into this and kind of pull it a blank shot to try and get some heat into the unit before I add my coffee and before I pull a shot. Now if you're used to using espresso machines a lot, there's one little thing that may throw you. Most espresso machines lock in from left to center. This doesn't. This locks in from right to center. So that will catch you out the first time if you're not used to it this way. So right now let's just do a little preheat, some boiling water in. So now we're rinsed, preheated, you could get this hotter probably if you soaked in a little hot water that wouldn't be a bad thing, to get it maximum maximum temperature. I guess one complaint I have is that this cup can be a little messy in the dispensing of grounds into the portafilter. They are very fluffy, which is good, but it just means it's quite easy for it to be messy. With some grinders like EK43 and cafes, you'll see them using some sort of dosing tool, and I think actually something like that for this could be quite useful. So they did send me a tamper with this. It is very heavy actually for the size, which is impressive. It is just for me a little bit small if I'm honest, I could do with just a little bit more width so you have to do like a couple of additional some sidewall tamps just to catch everything. All right, we're locked in. Now, you really wanna get your water straight off the boil, right. Don't let it sit around, you're gonna lose temperature. So as hot as you possibly can get it gave me the best results. Now, you can obviously filter different levels depending on how much you want. This much water definitely was more than I would need. So if you raise this up now, you begin pre-infusion, and I had best results with at least 15 seconds of pre-infusion. Just to help up the extraction a little bit. And then we press. Now at this point, I don't necessarily want more liquid in the cup, but there is still some liquid in the brewer itself, and I learned the hard way that what you don't wanna do is just take the portafilter out now 'cause it will be messy, right. So, if your espresso is the size that you want it, and typically I was brewing 16 grams of coffee to about 40 grams of liquid espresso, so a reasonably long shot, but that way I kind of hit the extractions that I wanted to. Once you've enjoyed your coffee, either bring the cup back and just give it a final squeeze through just to make sure you pushed all liquid out, and it just makes knocking out the puck afterwards much much much cleaner and easier. And so once you've pushed out all the water, what you're left with is really a very dry cake, very easy to clean up, knockout, and so that's definitely worth making as we're done completely. So how's the coffee, you ask? Well, the coffees I've had from here have been pretty good. Getting an extraction up is definitely a key to this and that means heat management first and foremost. You can grind really pretty fine for this thing. Getting everything as hot as you possibly can with this is definitely my number one priority. And it'll also mean typically the second or third shot out of it will probably be better than the very first, but often you only wanna make one, first thing in the morning, so spend the time getting it as hot as you can. Now, I would recommend brewing on scales if you can. That's how I brew most espresso in most places, and I feel like getting an accurate idea of how much liquid you've produced is definitely useful. The shape and design of this make that pretty easy to fit scales underneath here, and that was definitely not a problem for me in using it. So let's wrap this up into what I like, and maybe what I like less. The pros and the cons. Let's start with the grinder. I think the design is great for an espresso hand grinder. It's definitely grinding fine enough, the grind is really quite even, the long lever arm on here is a good thing and it's good to use. It's pretty easy to use. I have no real complaints about it. It is, in the world of hand grinders, expensive, but not absurdly expensive, so I think it's about 159, 169 pounds. It's actually a little bit more than the espresso maker. But it is well built. It is sturdy and they've thought it through, from a usability perspective, for grinding very fine. So that I think is good. I don't love the little cup for dosing out of, but there's probably another solution to that, anyway. As for the espresso maker, things I like: It's compact, it works well, you're definitely hitting high pressures. By having a narrower brew chamber than normal, it means that the force exerted per square inch means that actually pushing with only 16 or 17 kilos of force will give you nine bars of pressure inside the brew chamber. So that's a kind of nice smart thing. It does make good tasting coffee on the condition that you manage the heat of this unit. You definitely need to get it as hot as you can before using it especially if you like slightly lighter roasts in your espresso, with darker roast that may be just less of an issue. You can use this to make much larger espressos that I have done. Though I don't particularly enjoy those, that's kind of just my thing. I really preferred shots that were about one full piston of water, which was usually about just about 40 grams out depending on how long you left it to pre-infuse for. And again, pre-infusion is definitely useful and having total manual control of that is a good thing. I'd like some more guidance on the inside of this, to know where my fill level is, so that if I have a preferred water amount I can sort of dial in that rather than trying to fill it completely or fill it so it's about a centimeter from the top. A little extra here would be nice, though I do like this new material they're using here. I think it's a great improvement on their existing maker. I think it's 149 pounds, I think it's well built from start to finish. It can be a little messy, but actually, you can just pick this thing up and run it under the tap if you want to. So, the single unit construction is nice. I think it's well designed, it's thoughtful, it can make nice espresso. Again, like most of these type of units, it's a little bit of extra work and it's up to you if that's something you're willing to incorporate into your morning routine, as lots of people are, or actually if you'd like the convenience of an element, of a pump, of the extras that come with a good home espresso machine. Or, actually, if you just want something easy, convenient, oddly kind of zen to use; it's quite satisfying to push this thing down. There's no doubt that's kind of pleasurable. But that's it.", "videoID": "HdsqF83x9rA"}, {"title": "The Weber HG-2 - The $1,650 Hand Grinder", "text": "Today, we're gonna take a look at this. This is the Weber Workshops HG-2 Hand Grinder 2, the sequel to the HG-1. And it's a $1,500 hand grinder. Who is this for? What do you get for your money? What are the shots like? These are the questions we're gonna answer today. Now there's kind of a reason to review this grinder and there's kind of a reason not to review this grinder, for me. There is not to, honestly, is that I don't like hand grinding. You know what I mean, this grinder is built for people who love hand grinding and have the budget to go all the way in terms of buying the most luxurious, almost decadent grinder they can get for their money. I'm not that person, I like motors, I like electricity, especially in the morning to help me do the jobs that I don't want to do. The good reason to review this grinder is that Weber Workshops also recently launched on a crowdfunding kind of platform, the Key Grinder. Now that's a kind of electric version of this in many ways. It's the same burr set inside, some of the same technology in terms of what's called the magic tumbler, which we'll talk about. So in reviewing this, I guess we can get a little bit of insight about what's coming with the upcoming Key Grinder. What we'll do first is a quick tour of the grinder, tour of the features, the functionality, kind of what you get for your money. Let's start with the flywheel, which spins so nicely. When there's no coffee in there, it just spins and spins, very nicely made, feels very good. The whole grinder really has lovely fit and finish. The tolerances feel incredibly tight. It feels beautifully put together, something I said about Weber's other grinder, the EG-1 that I have on the back bar there. Now in an effort to save space, they've actually shrunk the base of the grinder compared to the EG-1, but they've also added this which has a collapsible handle. There, so now it's pretty compact. It kind of goes down. I don't know if I would necessarily use this feature much. It depends on the layout of your kitchen, obviously, but you know, if I'm putting it away and we're pulling it out, it's quite a heavy grinder. So it doesn't feel like something I'd want to move around a lot, but you know, in the efforts of space saving, it's a nice touch. It's a nice touch. Now, one of the big additions to this grinder is here at the front and it's this it's a gearing system. So here you've kind of got an option between grinding one-to-one. So one rotation of the flywheel equals one rotation of the burrs or kind of two to one, which is what it's in now, which is two rotations at the flywheel to one rotation of the burrs. That makes grinding much easier. Today, I'm gonna be using relatively light roasted coffee for espresso. I'll show you that now. And so for that, it's quite hard to grind. It's pretty much, it's not impossible, of the kind of one-to-one ratio, but it's just unpleasant. At the two-to-one ratio, grinding is really pretty easy. We'll talk more about that in a second. So that is a big innovation. It feels nice, it's clever. If you're grinding, for say filter coffee or you're grinding dark roasts where resistance is gonna be less of an issue, then you can just be more productive in getting more out of each turn. But you know, when it's hard, when your grinding is a little lighter, life can be easier because that's kind of the worst bit of hand grinding, right? Like no one enjoys the exercise aspect. That's not a fun way to exercise, I don't think. Let me turn it again one more time. Here you can see your grind marker. Now the way that this thing adjusts the grind is similar to how the HG-1 worked, which is you have a lifting locking ring, and then you would adjust it one way or the other, as always the larger the number, the coarser the grind. That's a very normal kind of setting. That's a good thing. Now, one of the things that's kind of weird for me about this is that you can actually lift the locking ring off entirely, right? Which does nothing, and it will only fit in, in certain places, which is a design thing, right? Like you're not gonna accidentally put it back down in the wrong place, like you'd see that the numbers have shifted too much, and so you'd know, you'd put it back incorrectly for where you were before. Feature-wise, it's not the most satisfying adjustment, certainly compared to how it works on the EG-1. This kind of lid piece here that sits just sort of loose on top of the burr set, the way your beans can fall in, go underneath, and then not popcorn out. So you don't have any popcorning issues, which works well. And then should you need to lift this up for whatever reason, you can do to kind of get in there. This brings us to the magic tumbler. Now the magic tumbler is a couple of different parts. It's this piece here, which is really very similar to the other Weber kind of tumbler, where you have a central piece that you lift out. This works just the same as the one in my EG-1. So you just have a piece in the middle, you lift it up, coffee falls out the bottom, works very well. This one has magnets around the top. So when you put it into place,  it locks in and stays there on its own. That's very satisfying. The interesting twist though, is this thing here. Now this, as you turn the handle acts to stir the coffee, right, that's kind of what's happening. It's mixing up and declumping the grounds. And it's kind of interesting. The results, I'll show you in a second, are quite impressive looking. Like it really helps with distribution. It really helps with declumping. It works very well. It feels quite fragile because it's just a little bit of wire bent around here. The nice thing is that they're kind of connected, the flywheel and the wire piece here because my flywheel will always end in the down position with the handle at the bottom, it means that the pin will always end in this position or the one exactly opposite if I'm geared that way or if I'm in the other gear, then it will always end up in the same place every single time. That's kind of nice. It doesn't cause me any problems when it comes to, you know, maneuvering it, 'cause you quickly learn where it's going to be each time. And that's kind of nice. So it's not a pain point, but the results I think are really interesting. Now at this point, what we should probably do is make some coffee. Now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grind 18.5 grams at the griund setting I've been using for espresso. I'm gonna just grind it. We're gonna let it run. The camera's gonna run the whole time. If you don't want to watch me grind the coffee and see how long it takes and see what the process looks like, you can use the kind of timestamps or chapter markers just to skip ahead. All done, now as you will have seen, occasionally, I do have a kind of lifting thing where it lifts slightly off the bench. Maybe that's a technique thing, maybe it's my mis-distribution of my effort in terms of holding it down versus spinning the wheel. I'd be interested to hear from other users about whether that's an issue for them, too. It doesn't bother me. It's just sort of notable in the kind of noise department. Now the coffee that comes out looks incredibly fluffy, like really super fluffy. And when you dose it into a portafilter, it looks great. So that looks fluffy. Now that stirring action might cause pieces almost to stick together. It sometimes looks like the coffee is more coarsely ground than it is. That's a very fine grind, that's espresso fine. It almost looks a little bit coarser because of the way it's been stirred. I haven't really had issues with extraction as a result. It is kind of notable though, the way that it produces grounds, that don't look like grounds usually look. Now such a fancy, fancy grinder, and I'm a fancy man deserves a fancy stirring and I have something for you. Oh yes. Oh so fancy. I'll tell you more about these at the end of the video. Now, the burr set in this thing is an 83mm conical burr set sourced from Mazzer in Italy. You'll know them from many fine conical burr grinders. They are seasoned and then coated to give them a really long lifespan, but you don't need to sort of break them in. They should be good straight out of the box, which, frankly, is a lovely way for a grinder manufacturer to approach the customer experience, I think and have thought for a decade or more, that seasoning a grinder is a very stupid experience, a very frustrating one for the consumer. That aside, the shots that this burr set produces are very nice, unsurprisingly. You know, you feel like conical burr sets in espresso have typically skewed towards texture, but this has not necessarily produced those kind of thick gooey shots because I don't think the roasts that I'm working with ever really will do that, right. Lighter roasts just never really create that kind of ultimate textural experience in espresso. The texture you do get though is lovely, like it's silky, it's just very soft. It's kind of, moussey more than buttery, like it's just light and fluffy and velvety. It's a very pleasant, textural experience, no question. Shots have had more than adequate extraction, plenty of sweetness to them. They've been very enjoyable shots. I would say pretty transparent, not necessarily those kinds of more kind of unimodal style, very sweet, but very linear style of espresso shots that you get from sort of low fines-producing flat burrs. This is producing a different spectrum of grind sizes. And that's kind of part of the desire of this thing. When it comes to comparisons, once again, the target for this thing, somehow, is gonna be the Niche grinder in part because I think the Key is aimed at people who want something like the Niche grinder, but want a different kind of build, an experience that goes with it that, you know, ends up costing kind of two to three times the price of the Niche. But are the shots that much better, right? Is the coffee from this burr set notably better than that from a Niche? Let's find out. So I pulled a shot of each, pretty much the same specs for both of them. One's you can see a little foamy, it's a little fresher. Time to double spoon. Now it's important to say that this is not a blind comparison and it has to be a kind of sort of demonstration shot, right? I've pulled lots of shots with both of these grinders. This is not a singular comparison. This is using these to explain a wider comparison of the two, The HG-2, very nice. and the Niche, and they're definitely different. You can feel the similarity, both the conical burr grinders, the bigger conical burr set doesn't taste, to me, sort of more conical in a way like it's not heavier. In this case, my experience with the kind of coffees that I drink is that often, not always, but sometimes I prefer the texture of the niche. It could be that little bit thicker. It's a more heavily used and seasoned grinder. It's the smaller burr set. It's electric versus manual, there's a lot of weird comparisons here. It rarely has the clarity and sweetness of this, right? And it's almost like the next one in this line would be a good flat burr grinder. You know, this sits probably closer to the sort of hybrid of the two, you know, this thing here than it does to just like a pure conical. So you get nice texture, you get a kind of lighter, silkier, softer, pretty moussey, delicate kind of texture that I really like, but you get nice sweetness, nice clarity, too. The Niche can feel that little bit heavier, but that little bit muddier with it as well, in my experience. It's not a huge difference here. And again, both are excellent, you know, and the reason to buy these are quite different. You know, they're different prices, they're different experiences. They're kind of weird comparisons, but I feel like it's the comparison most people want me to make, you know, for this video. Now I feel like this is probably more focused on espresso than anything else, but we should probably make a quick V60 to talk about how it is to grind for filter coffee. So grinding for filter is kind of where you'd want the gear system to kick in. And so I switched to the faster gear, so I should be able to grind much faster. I've got 20 grams of coffee ground, well it's gonna be ground, that little bit coarser for a V60. Now, as I'm working, it's worth mentioning a couple more pieces on the workflow front here. Firstly is this little dosing tin that comes with it, it's functionally great. It feels solid, and yet somehow doesn't really fit with the wider aesthetic of the unit. It doesn't really bother me, but it is worth kind of noting that it doesn't have that kind of decadence that the rest of this grinder does, but it makes it very easy to load coffee in. It's quite a narrow space. So some things you might want to weigh into, won't be that easy to pour into sometimes. Then as I make a mess, inevitably, I'll note in the handle here is a little brush. That's very nice. You just, you know, brush as you need to, pull a bit down, and it slots back in into the handle there. You've always got it to hand. That's very nice. That's a nice little detail. Last one that I didn't mention is actually in the base here. I don't love the little leather piece here. It doesn't please me the way the rest of the grinder does, but it does cover a magnet that sits under the base. Now, if you don't use the magic tumbler, you can get a little funnel piece that sits here and then a regular tumbler that's held in place by the magnet, again, a nice touch. I'm just not a hundred percent on the leather work, for me. Like I think a lot of people would like it. I just don't love it. It's just kind of me. Anyway, let's make some coffee. Filter coffee from this has been very nice. It's got a little bit more of that kind of textural experience that some people want to sacrifice for clarity. It's clarity is good, it's very good. I know a lot of people get upset that I like the Niche for filter coffee, and so it's probably no surprise that I think this is nice for filter coffee. I think if you are living a life where you can AB test this against a good flat burr grinder that has unimodal burrs, yeah, you'll sort of have a preference towards one over the other. In the singular moment of I made coffee, I sat down, and I drank it, did I enjoy it? Yeah, I think you probably would find that to be delicious. Well extracted, really nice texture, an enjoyable experience. So to wrap up, I'm gonna talk about who I think this grinder is kind of made for and who it isn't made for. And then also what we can probably infer from this grinder about the upcoming Key Grinder that I think a lot of people are very interested in. This is very expensive. We didn't talk a lot about the price, but $1,500 is a lot of money. And I feel like that in some ways, selects its audience a little bit. It's people who have a deep passion for a certain kind of sort of coffee experience and the budget to really go deep on that. This doesn't really belong in the comparison to things like hand grinders, which are about a bunch of other stuff, be it like good value in terms of getting a good burr set for minimal expenditure or having something portable or easy, or, you know, not taking up counter space. This is not that, it's a whole other experience that you're looking for. You are looking to have an exceedingly manual experience grinding coffee. And probably, it's gonna be paired with a lever machine because it feels like if you want this, you definitely want the experience of a lever machine alongside that. And that may lead you towards a certain style of espresso that I feel like this burr set probably, you know, is built for in many ways, right? Like I feel like you want the clarity and sweetness of great coffee, but you want texture. That's how you're gonna pull your lever shots. That's what you want your grinder to deliver. You want to feel connected, physically, to both of those things. If that isn't you, and honestly, it isn't me, that's okay, this isn't for you. But if that is an incredibly sort of enjoyable part of the process, if the touching, doing ritual part of it really is a pleasure for you, then I can see how this would absolutely appeal. Like all Weber stuff, I really like the build. The detail is there, the fit, the finish, it feels exceptionally well crafted and it feels expensive, but I feel like you know where the money is going, right? It doesn't feel like a bloated luxury product, even though it has that kind of decadence about it, you know, that not quite excess, but it's a lot, you know what I mean? Its build, its feel, its price is a lot. Now the magic tumbler here, I really liked it. I really enjoyed the experience. I'll be super interested to see how it translates across to the upcoming Key Grinder where you've got higher RPM that might change things a little bit. You've got to kind of a different experience, maybe more control, more consistency with an electric motor. I don't know what I'm gonna get, but I'm definitely intrigued by it. And if I was looking at ordering this or that, I would be very tempted to add the magic tumbler option. The coffee just looks so good in the basket, straight out of the tumbler, which is appealing and the shots have been great. So it feels like it's working. I was skeptical going in, but I definitely like it. So that is the Weber HG-2. And I feel like this absolutely speaks to you or it absolutely does not. And there's kind of no one in the middle there. You know what I mean? If this is appealing for you, I don't think you'll be disappointed by your experience. I think you'll feel like you've spent your money well. Spent a lot of money, but spent it well. And if this doesn't appeal to you, ignore it, move on, pay attention to the Key that's coming up that's kind of the same price, I think, but with an electric motor and no gearing, but it doesn't need that, but it's got variable sort of RPMs and stuff. It's definitely interesting. I look forward to playing with one of the finished units when they ship. Now, I don't get to keep this grinder. I'll be giving it away to one of my Patreon supporters. They are the ones that fund me, buying this stuff, reviewing it, and giving you my honest opinion. And I'm very grateful to them. And I love giving these things away to them. And if you've got one of these already, I do want to hear from you down in the comments below, what did I miss? What did I get right? What do you think I got wrong? I'd really like to hear from you, share your opinion with all of us. And just to wrap up, I did say, I'd tell you all about those spoons. Now, if you've been following this channel, you'll know that I have a fondness for fancy teaspoons and well, having had one set, I couldn't help, but want something even fancier. And so at Tens Hundreds Thousands, we teamed up with Umeshiso because Umeko makes the best spoons, you know, that I use, the kind of rainbow spoons all the time. They're amazing and we collaborated to create this, a beautiful box set of six rainbow demitasse spoons. So they're a single run. I think they look amazing like they're so cool. If you want to be a little bit fancy, I hope they appeal to you. I think they make the whole experience of drinking and stirring your espresso more fun. I think they're just fun and beautiful and amazing. And yeah, we're really excited about them.", "videoID": "FL65i1XhVec"}, {"title": "The Makita Coffee Machine\uff1a A Bizarre Battery-Powered Brewer", "text": "Today, we're gonna be reviewing this. It's the Makita coffee maker, a coffee machine made by the same people that make these  power tools. It's absurd, it's a bit silly and as such, well it deserves more than a regular review, we should do something a little bit special. Well, let's go to work. (Mournful a capella singing...)  Let me set the scene for you. You, a craftsman, an artisan, have come to work. You've spent the morning being very busy. You've been renovating a once industrious building into some expensive warehouse living, but it's break time. You're gonna grab your lunchbox, 'cause you deserve a delicious little treat. Now, obviously you're gonna want a drink with that. One of your colleagues, well, he offers you a tea, but you don't wanna drink an infusion of dry, dusty, broken tea leaves sewn into a paper coffin. No, you want a coffee. Now, you've got a Thermos, but obviously, this is not coffee, this is the beef consomm\u00e9 that you're gonna have as the soup course at lunchtime. You want fresh coffee, delicious, fresh coffee, and for that reason, being where you are and who you are, you reach for this, the Makita coffee maker. Now, we've gotta have just a little reality check here, just for a second, because I have friends who work at offices and maybe make some nice coffee at lunchtime or break time. They brew a little V60 and they are mocked, teased, ribbed mercilessly by their colleagues for being a little bit weird about coffee as if that's a bad thing. Now, I just can't imagine being the one guy on a building site that rolls in with my own personal coffee maker. Now hey, maybe I'm falling into stereotypes about builders, but it does seem like a little bit of an opportunity for some mockery from your colleagues. You're gonna brew some coffee, 'cause fresh brewed coffee's the best thing in the world, and we'll talk through how this little thing works. First thing to see on the side of this thing here, most important thing, is this little sled here. Now, Makita make two different types of batteries, two different voltages, there's an 18 volt battery, those are a bit bigger, and then there's a lower volt battery, I think around 12 volts maybe. You can use either one here, you've got choices, you just sort of slide backwards and forwards depending on your battery preference. Your water tank, here at the back, very simple and actually removable. And on here you can see you've got your little fill lines. Now, it says the capacity's 240 mls. That's sort of technically true, but it's not the brewer that decides the capacity of your brew, it's actually your battery, but we'll explain. You do also get your dual wall, stainless steel mug. Branded, very nice, not very big, but we're not brewing that much coffee with this. And then your brew basket. They do make a pod sort of basket, but we're not gonna use that today. This, this is the fresh coffee basket, and actually the design's kind of nice. You've got your sort of shower screen here, and then if you open it up inside, you've got your reusable mesh brew basket. It's not very big, but again, we're not making that much coffee. And that's, that's how it works. You put water in, you're gonna put coffee in here brew in just a second and you get coffee. But before we brew coffee, I did say I'd explain the battery thing, right? We're gonna do a little tiny bit of battery mathematics. So this is one of the lower voltage batteries, one of the smaller ones you could get. On a battery it'll tell you what its sort of amp hours are and if you've got the voltage too you can work out with the sort of watt-hours are. And in the case of this thing, it actually tells you it's 22 watt-hours. So this can deliver 22 watts of power for an entire hour. And then it's empty. The brewer here, when it's brewing is gonna pull 190 watts, which is a lot more than the 22 sort of Watts that this would discharge and theoretically as standard. And so you have a higher amperage draw which means the battery discharges much faster. So at that watt draw, you can do some basic math and discover that this will last for about seven minutes. And with seven minutes of brewing they say you can brew 160 mls of coffee, which is not very much coffee, especially when you think about the weight of this battery is about 210 grams. So to make coffee, you'd need to have 200 grams of battery 160 grams of water, some coffee, a grinder potentially and the brewer itself, which all of which weigh quite a lot more than like the Thermos of coffee would, but maybe, maybe this thing brews such spectacular coffee that it would be way better than whatever you could make in a Thermos at home with whatever setup you have and would bring in with you that might degrade a little bit over a couple of hours in the morning. So maybe it's amazing. We should find out. Now this battery, I'm gonna load in on the little sled. Done. We're ready to go. Let's get some water. Set the water in. Now coffee, they recommend a pretty weak recipe actually. They recommend like 50 grams a liter. I'm gonna brew 60 grams a litter because that's just how I like to brew my coffee. So let's grind some coffee. Grinder. Obviously we're not gonna hand crank the hand grinder when we've got drills and batteries lying around. In we go. And now we're ready to brew. Now, like I said, it takes seven minutes to brew a cup of coffee with this thing, with this little battery and that battery will take an hour to recharge. And if you've got chargers on site, that's great. But you'd think, oh, if we've got power on site why don't I just plug it in. But you can't plug it in, it's battery only. So every time you want a cup of coffee you'd need to carry a dedicated battery and 160 mls for this battery, well, if you want two or three cups in a day, yeah you might have half a dozen sort of batteries for your drill but are you gonna give half of them over to brewing coffee? Like I said, if it's amazing, if it's delicious, then maybe that's, you know, totally worth it for you. Now, if you stick a temperature probe inside the brew basket and sort of look at the temperature of the water coming in. Yeah, it hits perfectly normal temperatures that would match those of a cheap little domestic Mr. Coffee style filter coffee maker, you know some of you might spend \u00a320, 30 pounds on Amazon that's a comparable kind of performer to this thing here. It's not bad. It starts a bit cold. It gets a bit hot at the end. The technology inside a brewer is kind of identical. What's sort of interesting here is that it runs on batteries. That's its point of difference really. So the brew light's gone out, we're ready to drink but it's going to be a little bit too hot to drink straight away. So I'm gonna have to think of something to do to pass the time. I have an idea. \u266a And now a short ad \u266a \u266a from this video's sponsor \u266a \u266a It's Squarespace \u266a - If you need a website or a domain then I would recommend checking out Squarespace (\u266a He recommends it \u266a ) Now there's a lot of different reasons you might have to build a website.

Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. In one!  It's time to taste. Now 160 mls in this cup produces a fairly disappointing serving. My 10 grams of coffee would have stolen about 20 grams of brew water. So I've got 140 mls for my battery. 10 grams of coffee. That's you know maybe less caffeine that you might want to drink, but is it good? Is it delicious?  Hmm. It's fine. It's fine! It's, it's fine. It's okay. It's exactly what you think it'll taste like if you brewed a small batch of coffee on a cheap domestic Mr. Coffee type machine. It's good coffee. It's good water. It's freshly ground. You know, all of the sort of key components for success are there. The brew temperature's not perfect and certainly not for a lighter roast, but it's not that bad, but it's not that good. You know, it's, it's sort of fine. I'm not, if I'm honest, I'm not sure it's good enough to drink alongside the delicious treat that I have bought myself for today's snack time. So I'm gonna brew something else because honestly if you're gonna brew coffee at work just bring an Aeropress with you, you know, boiler kettle, and brew an Aeropress. Now you're gonna say how am I boiling a kettle, I'm on a building site, there's no power supplies available to me. What sort of kettle could I possibly use? Makita have you covered. Look at this! Look at this! It's a kettle! It's a kettle that runs on Makita drill batteries. Now you've gotta have the big juicy batteries the big chunky chunky batteries. And this needs two of them at the same time to pull the wattage it needs. Now it looks, looks like a big kettle. 800 mls is your maximum. We're not gonna put 800 mls in there because that's wasteful. We don't need that much water. We're gonna replicate this brew, but with an Aeropress. So we'll brew, we'll do 160-200 mls, kind of a thing in here, should boil pretty quickly. And let's see if I can make a better building site coffee than this thing can. While still, you know, not betraying Makita. You know what I mean? We've gotta be loyal to our power tool brands apparently. So like I said, I need two, but one of them is still on my drill and I've got to grind some coffee. You know, I'm sure there's a good reason I dunno what it would be, I'm sure there is probably a good reason not to use a drill to grind coffee. It's definitely, you know, fun. I will say that, I'm having a great time doing this. Oh, I do also hate hand grinding. So that's probably a factor in this. Now I'm not actually too worried about having drained this battery out with a bit of drilling. Two of these batteries full will do 1.4 liters of water in total, assuming that your water is 23 degrees Celsius to start with, but we're not gonna get anywhere close to that with 200 mls, so we'll be completely fine. Got myself a clean mug, but as I've just discovered this Aeropress: bit of a snug fit. Not sure if I'm necessarily gonna recommend that but we'll we'll make it work. It's about 10 grams of coffee to 160 grams  of water. Thank you for that, extremely thorough beep. 160. So a little press. Now I'm hesitant to press this too hard 'cause I really I don't wanna jam this into the mug. That's gone very wrong. Do not brew this Aeropress on a Makita mug. Bring a different mug from home. You can have a stainless steel one if you want to, just this is not a good, this is not a good time for anyone. Now that's good coffee. So this is the Makita coffee brewer. Let's ignore the kettle for now. I'm having great coffee, but not honestly from the Makita. And I just, I just don't understand why this exists. I kind of get that they thought here's an opportunity we could just make a little coffee maker but the battery to liquid ratio which is a weird thing to say out loud, it's pretty poor. Like it's just a lot of battery weight to carry around to just make a cup of coffee. And actually even the kettle, like these two batteries they weigh over a kilo. This thing weighs a kilo. Like you're just dragging a lot of stuff around the place. And honestly most building sites find some way to have a power supply. Just buy a cheap coffee maker and plug it in. And it won't annoy you as much. The use cases for this where this and only this is the right answer to the problem are so incredibly tiny that they pretty much overlap exactly with the sort of use cases where this would do a better job, you know? So I don't get it. But now I wanna hear from you.", "videoID": "4xOEIpbxM4w"}, {"title": "Can You Roast Coffee In Helium\uff1f", "text": "Today we're gonna try and roast coffee in helium. Now, you probably have questions such as \"how?\" or \"why?\". Let me answer the \"why\" first. A little while back I made a video deep frying green coffee to roast it, and the results tasted way better than they were supposed to, and there were some theories as to why that was. Someone said that maybe it's because deep frying in oil was effectively deep frying in an oxygen-free environment. Maybe no oxygen in the roasting process changed the roasting chemistry. And then someone else sent a different message saying maybe it's just 'cause oil is more conductive. It did a better job transferring the energy. You didn't have to sort of have the oil as hot, and that way you had a more even roast as a result. And tagged onto this email was a lovely little fact. They said, \"Did you know that helium gas \"is way more thermally conductive than air?\" I didn't know that. Who knows that? But sparked a thought. I wanted to roast in helium. Was that even possible? And that's what brought me here. I'm in a company in France called Jacomex, who very kindly hosted us here, and they build glove boxes. You've probably seen them in movies. You know, they have terrifying things inside that scientists are handling very carefully. They've lent us two today, and IKAWA have kindly lent us two of their roasters to put inside them. And we can fill one of the glove boxes with nitrogen to have a zero-oxygen environment that should act in a very similar way to air. And then they flush the other with pure helium. And we're gonna roast inside them, see what happens, see if it makes any difference at all. Honestly, I have no idea. Let me show you a little bit more about how the whole experiment is designed. So this is a glove box. Jacomex build them for everything from the medical industry through to the nuclear industry. It is a hermetically sealed metal box. Inside, the stuff that you wanna handle that you wanna keep separate from yourself. Anyway, this is ours, this is our first one. It is full of nitrogen, an inert gas, most of our atmosphere, but there is zero oxygen in here. There's actually a little display telling me there is no oxygen. And we've got some samples of raw coffee and we're gonna roast them. Now the stressful bit of this, the bit that keeps me up at night, is that these take 24 hours to set up. If something goes wrong and we have to get into this glove box, the experiment is over. We can't reset it because it takes too long. We've only got a few hours here to do this test. It's time to try and get my gloves on and roast some coffee. It's like trying to put on a washing-up glove underwater. Fortunately , here we go, we can power the roaster inside the box, which is here. These are my samples. So I'm gonna fire up the roaster, start it heating. I'm gonna load some green coffee into the top chamber here, and when it's time to roast, we'll roast. You probably can't see this. It says, \"Preheating.\" Once we are heated, all I have to do is turn this to... Oh, hello. Strange things happening in here. I think the heat is potentially adding to the pressure inside this chamber, which is a variable again, which is slightly terrifying. Okay, we're ready to roast. Here we go. It's time to go. It's so weird that I can't hear it. It is roasting. It has begun. I don't know if we're gonna get any weird effects from the nitrogen. I would presume not. The twist might be that this is a pressurized environment now, which may make things different. I just don't know. I just don't know. Now, the roaster's hopefully gonna adapt to whatever challenges it has to sort of hit the temperatures that it needs to hit. I'm so close to dressed in gloves. Come on now. I'm gonna win. I'm gonna win. Oh. They've gotta have baby powder here somewhere. I'm exhausted. As it gets to the end of the roast, it will stop heating and it'll blow a bunch of cold air through the coffee to cool it down. Yeah, you can see a little smoke coming out the top of the roaster. So in theory we might have a little bit of potential for smoke taint in the second batch. It's hard to say. So what we have here is going to be potentially one of the first batches of purely zero-oxygen roasted coffee. I know people have done low-oxygen patents, but I don't think anyone's done zero, or whatever we're at here, which is close to zero. There it is. Roast number one is done. Let's do another roast just to be sure. Things that were once simple are not simple when you're wearing enormous washing-up gloves for safety. Like, putting your glasses back up or doing your hair. Ready to roast. On we go. Goodbye, coffee. I wish you the best of luck. So this roast is tracking almost identically to the previous one, which, when we come to do blind tasting later, should be useful. Batch number two. I feel like we've had two successful roasts in nitrogen. It's probably time for the main event. This should be exciting enough, but the next thing is so much more interesting. This is our helium glove box. This has been flushed, ready to go. It's only got one glass side, so forgive me for the kind of awkward pressing of myself to the glass. The interesting thing about helium is that it is five times more thermally conductive than air. That should change the way the coffee roasts, but we don't know how. At the end of this first roast, we may need to adjust the profile if it roasts really dark or does something weird, but there's only one way to find out. It begins. The roaster is not running. Interesting, terrifying, stressful. Nothing's working. The fan is just not blowing. So there's two possibilities. One, we have an unfortunately broken roaster, which is terrible news because we can't break the seal and reflush it any time soon. Or that no roaster will work in helium. You know, it's not a thing you test for when you're manufacturing roasters that will it run in helium, pure helium. But it's on. Like, parts of it are working. There's light, it's powering on, but just one bit says no. And I can't imagine that the blower can't work. I just don't know what's going on. So I thought the roaster was broken. It wasn't broken, I'm just an idiot. And a lot of you watching this at this point will be like, \"Yeah, of course this was never gonna work. \"Helium is way less dense than air. \"How could you blow helium and expect it to churn \"and move coffee when it's like 1/10 of the density of air?\" Or around there, I think. Yeah, so that's probably not gonna work. I don't if we can get away with that. I'm gonna try an experimental thing just before we give up completely where I've got maybe 10 grams in the roaster, and I'm hoping that if I run the fan at full bore we can maybe still roast some coffee. But it may just not work at all. It's a long way to come for failure, but that's okay. Tiny amount of coffee in. Oh, we've got some tiny amount of movement. Oh! It might work. It might work. I mean, it's roasting now. Something's happening. This will be brown coffee that we can drink at the end of this. So as speculated, the gap between sort of the heater temp and the coffee temp is way lower to achieve the same kind of rate of rise, or thermal transfer, I suppose, for better terms. So the theory is sound, just some flaws in the initial experimental design. So we'll roast again one more time after this another tiny amount, see if it goes better this time. We're done, okay, can it push the coffee out if we push eject? Can you do it? Come on now. Come on now. The answer is no, I have to do it by hand. Okay. That actually doesn't look like a bad roast. I mean, there's not a lot there, but that looks like a drinkable roasted coffee. I'm gonna try it again, see if we can do a better job. We got some spin. Come on. I might have put too much coffee in this time. There might be too much coffee in there. It's hard to keep this family friendly right now, gotta tell you. It's already burned one side of some of them. This is terrible. I think I stop. I'm not wasting time and energy. Okay, third time. Please, please spin for me. Come on now. There you go. We've got some spinning. Who knew that seeing coffee spin would be this relieving to anyone? I'm sort of stunned we've pulled this off. I thought when it stopped running when the fan didn't blow, I thought we were done. I thought we had just failed and this would be an embarrassing day for me. But it's not. It's not. I can't wait to drink this. Even if it's disgusting, it will be a world first. Not that world firsts are necessarily sensible or good things, I know that. I know that there's a reason no one's done this before now. I really would like to take these gloves off now, gotta be honest with you. Just look. It's like they're vacuum pressed to my fingers. I don't like it. We can peel the gloves off now that we're done. Feels much easier. Let's pass out the success. Ooh, it smells. Ah, it smells pretty good. It does. It smells pretty good in there. Right. Come on. Three samples, success. Let me show you this. This is what failure looks like. It's a collection of failed, failed experiments. Now perhaps against the odds, I have my coffee in my bag ready to take home to taste.

Even if these are gonna taste awful, I'm still very excited. Now we've got three groups here each representing a grouping of the different gases these have been roasted in. However, I don't which grouping is which. We had enough of the helium roasts to do sort of one bowl of each. So for the helium grouping, wherever it is, there's three different roasts. For the kind of control roast, there's three bowls of the same coffee. And for the nitrogen roast where we got a couple of good roasts, then there's two bowls, but I don't really know how they're mixed up. I will taste these blind, see what's going on, and then we'll talk about sort of what tastes like what at the end. Anyway, I'm gonna put some hot water on these, give a little taste, and see what's happening. These have cooled enough for me to taste. Should I do so with excitement and trepidation? You'll get one slurp per grouping. There's a sort of weird absence of sweetness and a strange acidity that's less enjoyable than the acidity in these ones here for me. This one tastes about the most normal of them. I don't if that's good or bad yet. These are definitely weird, and I'm not sure good, which makes me think it's the helium. It's also a bit more bitter, and I feel like on a technical level this roast did not work out that well. There'd be some unevenness issue. Oh, much better in comparison. It's hard 'cause they're still a little bit warmer than I'd want. This is the cleanest, sweetest of the grouping. This isn't by any means bad. This is bad. I think this is bad. I don't what this is, but this is bad. This is not bad. This is better. What will it mean when we discover what they are? Let's start with the reveal. This says \"Helium one.\" So this is the helium grouping, as we suspected. Technically quite flawed. I think helium probably works pretty well as a gas for thermal transfer, but because it can't tumble and move the coffee, you end up with very uneven roast. And really I think that's the primary defect that we're tasting here is unevenness. It's got a little harshness. It's not fully sort of developed. That is terrible. We did cut open each of the coffee beans to have a look inside. I'll show you a macro picture of each one side by side. I'm not sure there's that much to be learned from looking at the inside of them. All of them went brown to a very similar color. And I will say my best guess as to sort of end temperature on the IKAWA profile for helium was surprisingly close to what it should have been. You know, the probe is not reading the coffee temperature in those things. It's reading the temperature in the roasting chamber, and so there will always be a differential between that probe's temperature and bean temperature. Dropping that temperature down but knowing there was better thermal transfer meant that, you know, the bean was gonna be closer in temperature to the probe. I guess it worked out. It's not a good roast though. It's not a good roast. This will be interesting though what this one is. Nitrogen in the middle here. That is not surprising necessarily. So let me just check you are control. You are control. Good. I mean obviously, what else would it be? Going back to taste these again, there's not a lot in it, but there is just something lighter, brighter, more complex in this. By having 20% oxygen, you know, the amount of oxygen in the air here in this roast, it seems to have done something positive. This one here had literally none, like below 0.1% oxygen. It was as close to zero as you practically can be. That's their job to get rid of all the oxygen when you're using these things. Based on this singular tasting, which is not a good thing to make a large decision based on, but here I'm not seeing anything compelling saying removing oxygen improves roasting chemistry in any meaningful way. I mean, removing, you know, all sensible gases turns out to be not a sensible thing whatsoever, but, you know, good old air in fact not a bad thing. Not a bad thing at all. And that, I think, is good to know. That's reassuring for many of us. But, you know, the classics maybe work the best. In addition, I didn't really understand that helium is a non-renewable resource, and so it's probably tremendously good news that it's terrible for roasting coffee 'cause we shouldn't be using it for that. It's useful for many things. Let's just say coffee not one of them. But I'm glad we found out. I'm glad we learned the thing that was interesting. I'm glad we did some science and tried something completely new, even if it was for about 10 minutes completely terrifying at the time. But now I wanna hear from you down in the comments below. We've roasted in air. We've roasted in helium. We've roasted in oil. What else? What other media are out there that we could roast coffee in? I don't feel like we should give up at this point.", "videoID": "RhhkRsr6zJE"}, {"title": "The Bialetti Moka Express (Episode #1)", "text": "Today we're looking at another brewer in our classics of coffee series. This is the Bialetti Moka Express. It is, I think, perhaps the most iconic coffee brewer ever made. You may disagree with me there. You can leave a comment down below telling me why and how I'm wrong, but I would say this is kind of it. This is shorthand for coffee at a whole bunch of situations. You could show me a silhouette of this coffee brewer from any angle, and I would know exactly which coffee brewer it was. The story of the moka express, the real triumph of the Bialetti coffee company is an interesting one. The invention of the device goes back to 1933. And if you read about it, there's a little bit of confusion over who the real inventor was. Alfonso Bialetti had started his aluminum company in 1919. He'd returned from an apprenticeship in France and come back home to Pierremont. So obviously his name goes on the patent, but you'll see a name which is Luigi de Ponti. He, I think was an inventor who worked for Bialetti, so I suspect the patent kind of would belong to both of them. Now, it's actually really difficult to find an original patent. You can find an image online, but you can't seemingly find the actual patent from 1933. It may not actually have been filed at that point. Without seeing the original patent or the original sort of documentation of the invention, you can't necessarily be a hundred percent sure what the actual innovations around the product were, but we have a pretty good idea. Now, if you go back a little bit, and for that you need an encyclopedia of coffee makers. I happen to have one just here. This is an incredible book. It's by Enrico Maltoni and Mauro Carli, and it documents coffee makers throughout history with stunning pictures. Now you can see there were steam powered espresso machines that predated the moka express. But in many cases, if you look at the brewer from say, Oikos from 1911, you can see that it's using sort of the steam pressure to drive hot water over the coffee, and it's still kind of producing like a little miniature pour-over. The same is true if you look at this particular brewer, same sort of idea, electric this one, but the original patent goes back to 1878. So using steam in a coffee maker was not necessarily particularly new. Seemingly the real innovation was stacking the brewer in such a way that you could use the power of steam to drive water through coffee, instead of move it above coffee. This way you could also brew a little bit quicker, which was increasingly a problem people wanted to solve. And thus the moka express was born. And actually the original prototype didn't look quite like this, but it did look very similar. Now, in 1945, Alfonso's son, Renato, had returned from the German prison of war camps and had taken over the family business. And this change was transformational for the Bialetti company. Renato focused the company on the moka express and soon turned it into an iconic Italian, in fact, global coffee brand. In the 1950s, the company hired a cartoonist to create the logo. He drew what became known as L'omino coi baffi, literally the man with the mustache. Apparently based on Renato, which seems believable to me. Now, in the 1950s Renato did file some patents that you can see and you can find, and in it you see the change to this distinct shape that you see today. They'd widened the base here from the prototype to have better heat capture from the source underneath. You have the bakelite handle in here, and the sort of shape of the top lid sort of handle too becomes kind of iconic as well. While I'm here, this seems like the perfect moment to talk about how this thing works if you are somehow unfamiliar with it. And I would say most people watching this video are familiar with it, owing to the massive success of this brewer. Now, if you take it apart, you've really got three sections. You've got your base where you put your water and start with. Actually one of the innovations that came very early in 1950s was this, the addition of a safety valve. Now, in a modern one, you can test this. You probably shouldn't test this, though. They do open at about three bars of pressure. That would happen if say, your filter had become clogged and water couldn't get through coffee, and you don't wanna create a small bomb. So any pressured vessel should have a safety valve. But that's it, it's a simple piece. Aluminum is pretty good at conducting heat through it. And then above it, you've got this. A kind of two in one. It's a funnel that allows water to be pressed up through this way from the base of the unit, by the steam around it. And then you've got your filter that holds coffee. So a little bit of a mesh to help distribute water through the coffee, put that on there. And then the filtration is done in this top section. You've got a gasket here, that's one of the few parts that you may occasionally need to change on this. And then a filter that the coffee sits against that would filter out any pieces of coffee that are sizeable. It's pretty small holes so you should have a relatively clean cup, not dissimilar from espresso. In the top is where your coffee ends up when it's brewed, and you would pour from here, drink and enjoy. Now, there are three common misconceptions around this brewer that I do just quickly want to clear up. Firstly, there's the idea that actually letting a layer of coffee build up around it is a good thing. It's not, it's old coffee, it's dirt. You can call it a patina and feel good about it, but it's dirt and it's not improving the taste of your coffee, and I would strongly recommend you clean it thoroughly every single time you use it. Secondly, you know, a lot of people say this makes something like espresso. It isn't espresso. It makes quite a different beverage on a kind of technical level. You don't brew it at the high pressures of espresso. You don't grind as fine as espresso. You use a little bit more water in terms of your coffee to water ratio. And though it is a strong cup of coffee at the end of it, and it can be very textured and kind of intense, and it is metal filtered, which will give it that kind of thick mouthfeel that espresso often has, it doesn't have real true kind of creamer and a different drink. And it's nothing to worst for it. Espresso isn't the pinnacle of coffee brewing, it's just a brewing method. This makes, if you use it right, delicious coffee. Thirdly, there was a scare a little while ago about aluminum using these kinds of brewers relating to Alzheimer's. You'll see links or information on many Alzheimer's websites saying this isn't a thing, don't worry about it, but it has kind of persisted as a kind of weird myth around the brewer. To say that the moka pot has ingrained itself into Italian culture, actually kind of feels like an understatement. One study showed that nine out of every 10 Italian households has one of these things. Bialetti's relentless marketing coupled with the fact that this actually makes pretty good coffee, provided a very compelling alternative to going to the bar for a cup of espresso. -  Prodotto Bialetti! - Watching these old Bialetti adverts is something of an experience. They were created for and broadcast in a show called Carosello. It was a kind of 10 minute variety show of advertising shown after the main evening news in Italy. And it was hugely popular, reaching an audience of up to 10 million. The messaging of the moka express was pretty consistent. It seems easy. You need coffee, you need water, you need fire, but you also need care. And the moka express, of course. Regardless of how we feel now, watching them back, they were unquestionably hugely effective at the time. Bialetti manufactured and sold millions of these things. You see estimates online of them selling over the years between two and 300 million moka express. That's a lot of coffee brewers. On top of the two to 300 million units sold by Bialetti, there are obviously pots sold by other companies, other brands. This one is made by Alessi, another iconic company, actually founded in the same town as Bialetti around the same time. And I think one of the Bialettis at some point married one of the Alessis. But despite this, no one's really captured the mindshare or the market share of Bialetti over the years. That said, Bialetti have had maybe a tough decade gone by, and I'll tell you a little bit more about that. I'll tell you how you can win a copy of the Coffee Makers book, and I'll show you something super interesting for the next video in this series, after a short ad for this video sponsor, which is Squarespace.

Now, in 1986, the company is sold to the Faema group. They make espresso machines, you might be familiar with Faema's over the years or their iconic machines too. But in 1993, they sell the brand on to Rondine Italia. They make cookware, kitchenware. Ultimately those two brands merge into Bialetti industries, which is the company that would ultimately go on to be traded on Italy stock market. Sadly in 2016, Renato Bialetti passed away at the age of 93. In accordance with Renato and his family's wishes, his ashes were interred, not in a traditional urn, but in a large moka pot. By 2018, the company finds itself in serious trouble. It had accrued over $70 million worth of debt and it was struggling to continue to trade. It would declare bankruptcy and manage to get a near $40 million loan from an American hedge fund company called Sculptor. The company continues to trade, though I think it funds at a difficult market with a lot of competitions coming from things like pots in, almost especially within Italy itself. I can't help but feel though that even if Bialetti as a company fails, this thing that they've created will live on. That if Bialetti goes away, the moka express, via this shape, this design, this idea, the coffee that it produces will last decades more. Now in the past, I have made an ultimate moka pot technique. There is a video I actually made with ChefSteps. It's been delightfully successful over on their channel. But it's time to look at it again. And for that, I have something pretty cool. This is very exciting. Now, I had a lot of help with this. In fact, this was manufactured, created by Gabor, who you might be familiar with from the Smart Espresso Profiler. And that's kind of a part of what this is. He has built a Frankenmoka. It has three temperature probes in and around it, sort of inside the brewer to track what's happening at different stages. We will have both a gauge and a Smart Espresso Profiler attached to it so that we can go deep on exploring exactly how this thing works to create a new ultimate technique. So a little bit like the AeroPress series, the second video in this series will be an understanding the moka pot, where we do a bunch of different experiments and see what we learn. And at the end of it, they'll also be one of these to give away. So keep your eye out for that. It'll be coming out very early in 2022. Now, I did say you could also win a book. This thing is beautiful and I just so happen to have two copies, so I thought I should give one of them away. You don't need to do much to enter, just click the link down the description below. There's a very simple competition to enter, open to anyone and everyone. I'll leave a link to buy the book too. It is expensive. It's a small print run of a very niche thing, but it is so cool, so beautiful, and so interesting to look through. The evolution of coffee makers is a fascinating subject. And now I wanna hear from you down in the comments below. As I said at the start, if you can think of a more iconic coffee brewer, I wanna hear from you down in the comments below. Let me know what you think is more globally iconic than the moka express.", "videoID": "upgQsA5kLAk"}, {"title": "Chamberlain Vs McKinnon - YouTuber Coffee Review", "text": "I've got something a little bit different for you today. Now, it seems to be well-known that YouTubers as a species are pretty into coffee. Most of them, at some point, seemingly have done a how to brew coffee guide. And I suppose I'm no different. But what is new ish? What is different is YouTubers getting into coffee in a brand type way. So I've got here two different products from two different, pretty big YouTubers. So first up, we have the Golden Hour Blend. Now, this is a collab between Peter McKinnon. You probably know him as a photographer, a videographer, Canadian and James Coffee Company who are a San Diego based coffee company. I think one of the founders is a famous musician, a guy called David Kennedy who is in a band called Angels And Airwaves that honestly, I just haven't really heard of. I've been following Peter McKinnon for a long time. I've known him to be into coffee for a long time. He's someone very much kind of on my radar. Now, the other thing we have here is from a much bigger YouTuber called Emma Chamberlain. Now, if you don't know who Emma Chamberlain is, I am definitely not qualified to tell you. But if you do, she needs to explain. She is a massive creator on the platform and she's gotten into coffee too. Now, she's not roasting the coffee. Peter McKinnon is not roasting the coffee, but her name is very much on the product here. So this is her coffee company which is a little bit different and it's a whole other product. So this is not beans, this is a pre-ground kind of tea bag of coffee. Now, I had two very different experiences buying these products. This was very easy to buy. The shipping was brutally expensive, but it was here in like two days which meant that I had to go straight into the freezer because sometimes the freezer is good but this is not for now. While I waited for the other one. The Chamberlain Coffee was a less enjoyable purchasing experience. I bought it at exactly the same time and I waited and I heard nothing. And so after a little while, after several days, I emailed them and said, \"Hey, just wanting an update,\" to which I received no reply. And then a week after that, I chase again and I finally get a response from someone saying, \"Oh yeah, there's a problem with your shipping address. \"What's your shipping address?\" And I was like, \"It's the address \"in the confirmation email that you sent me.\" And no one really responded or acknowledged that. And then eventually they shipped me some coffee and it finally turned up. So as a customer experience, very good but expensive and just very bad actually. But this is a taste test first and foremost. The question is, are these any good? Are they delicious? Should you buy them? If you like them as YouTubers, would I recommend their coffee? So that's what we're gonna do today. We're gonna brew up some coffee. We're gonna brew this as they recommend on the back of the bag. I suspect that, Peter McKinnon, big Chemex fan and there's a Chemex recipe on the back of the bag. So we're gonna brew it in the Chemex exactly as they would want us to. And then here, I'm gonna brew this weird old teabag in a cup of hot water and see what happens. Let's find out. So first up is the McKinnon is the James coffee co and a little bit of a surprise for me. I don't know why, but I thought this was gonna be a little bit of a darker roast. This is actually really pretty light. It smells. There's a little berry fruit in there, but there's also just a little bit of kind of green vegetal smells that suggest that it might be a touch too light for my taste. Anyway, we'll find out, let's get this brewing. Now, they do give actually a pretty good brewing guide. They hit a lot of the things that I would recommend when brewing with the Chemex or anything else. So we're gonna brew a two to one bloom. Now I'm gonna swell a bloom, which they don't recommend but get everything nicely saturated. And they recommend a 45 second bloom, which I'm fully on board with. This is 48 grams in, we're gonna brew a total of 720. So about 66, 67 grams per liter. Again, perfectly sensible dose. Aiming for a four minute 30 brew time. So points here for good brewing guide. 720. There's a recommended stir, which I approve of also. And now we wait for the drain, it should take four and a half minutes. So we have brewed this exactly to spec. It was eight seconds late, I think that's acceptable. Fight me. So we'll let that cool down. We'll leave that here. And now it is the time to, I don't think we need the scales even, to brew the Chamberlain coffee. This is a brewing process, comes in three stages. You put it in here, we're gonna pour water over it. We're gonna dunk it around like a teabag. We're gonna let it hang out for a while. And at some point we'll have coffee. It feels easier. There's not the same kind of really specific instructions that you have over here for a brewing guide. This is much more relaxed, easy, friendly, approachable, not weird and geeky like us. Now, this thing smells pretty dark, actually. This smells like a much much darker roast than the McKinnon. What's kind of interesting here is actually the components on paper are a little bit similar between the two. The golden hour blend is I think coffees from Guatemala, Colombia, and Brazil, though if you go to the website, you can see exactly which firms they're buying from, which is good. Here, the Chamberlain coffee, not a lot of detail other than it's from I think Guatemala, Colombia, and Nicaragua, but not the same kind of detail, certainly on there anyway. Now, we've freshly boiled some water and we gently apparently pour eight ounces over the top of this. That was our submerge stage. And then we do the saturate which is the dunk for 15 seconds with the up and down or you can dunk for longer for added strength. Now, it says to leave the bag in until you've reached your preferred strength. Now, I don't really know when that is because I'll need to take the bag out to taste it. And then I guess, do I put it back in? I don't know. From the color, it looks like we've got plenty of flavor out of these grounds. Now, this is I think a pretty dark roast and darker roasts do give up their flavors a little but more easily. Let's just pull them out of there. Looks to me. It is a bit too strong, actually. I might just top that up with a little water. It's tricky. You definitely wanna top up afterwards. You wouldn't wanna dunk in a really full cup, that would be awkward. So I think the top up is probably a good thing. Now, this is too hot to drink, and they do say, wait five minutes plus. I would say 10 minutes plus, and I'm also gonna decant some of the McKinnon/ James coffee. Lovely. And then our assessment can begin. So, let's let these cool down a little bit. And then we can do some proper tasting and I'll tell you if they're good or bad or somewhere in the middle. If you're new to the language of coffee tasting, I'm gonna try and keep it not too weird. Coffee people can get really weird when they come to describing coffee flavor. I'm not gonna get too crazy with it, too pretentious, I hope. So let's start with the golden hour. Now, the tasting notes for this, there's just three, red berry, sweet cocoa, salted caramel, interesting last choice. The Chamberlain coffee, sort of similar vibes, right? Tasty nights of chocolate, cherry and nuts. So both of them aiming for like a crowd-pleaser type bunch of flavors. When you see berry flavors on there, or cherry flavors that suggests a little bit of acidity in the coffee. When you see words like chocolate or nuts or that kinda stuff it suggests some sweetness would be there naturally within the coffee. Let's find out. I'm pleasantly surprised if I'm honest, there's some nice sweetness in this cup, it's definitely pleasant. It's an enjoyable cup of coffee. I can nitpick it and I'll do that in a minute. But fundamentally, it feels like there's some pretty good raw coffee in there. And the roast, I don't really have any arguments with. As a YouTuber coffee goes, so far, I'm a little bit impressed. Let's have a little taste to the Chamberlain. Now, this smells like a much, much darker roast. And it tastes like a much, much darker roast. If you like dark roast, that's totally okay. If you like dark roast, you absolutely shouldn't buy this. And you might enjoy this a lot more. Generally speaking, the sort of darker, the deeper you roast coffee, the less acidity it will have when you drink it. The less of it's kind of origin characteristics that I said will have its own distinct flavors. And the more bitterness you'll have. But at the same time, the more body you'll have, it'll have more texture, it'll feel fuller and richer. Some people really hate acidity in coffee and really love texture and heaviness and that little bit of bitterness, they enjoy that. They enjoy darker roasts. I don't because I really enjoy tasting kind of where the coffee came from. So I'm drawn to sort of lighter roasts. You can roast so light that it's not pleasant and those tastes can become quite grassy and quite harsh, quite vegetal often. And there's a little tiny bit of that in here. If I was to be super critical, it's just a tiny bit underdeveloped. I don't know which of the three components is a little underdeveloped, but something's a little bit grassy and green in there for me. The Chamberlain coffee, it's a kind of dominant bitterness. It has a nice texture. It feels very full, very heavy. If you like milk or cream in your coffee, this is designed for that, I feel. But if you like the taste of coffee, then that's kind of been roasted out a little bit more with this. When it comes to the descriptors of like chocolate and that's, I kind of get what you're trying to say with this coffee, cherry, I don't think there's anything that resembles cherry in here for me, if I'm honest. And so I guess it's ultimately not surprising that I kind of prefer this one. It comes in whole beans. It's clearly designed for somebody that has a grinder at home that really enjoys the process of making coffee. This is the exact opposite. It's in a tea bag of coffee. It's supposed to be as easy as possible to make this product. That's kind of a big part of this whole thing, convenience. Am I saying, don't buy this because I don't like it. Well, no, not really. I mean one, you might like darker roasts too. You might really value the convenience factor here. Three, you might just wanna support Emma Chamberlain. And I get that. And for the same reason, if you really love Peter McKinnon and wanna support him, you might wanna buy this. There are a lot of coffee roasting companies in the US and Canada and Europe, around the world now. There's a huge amount of choice. And so I guess that actually collaborations like this are a good reason to try James coffee co. I think it's a nice idea. I think it's a nice way to bring new people in if you're a coffee business trying to find a new audience to connect with. That makes good sense. So if you're a huge McKinnon fan, if you love coffee, yeah, do it, give it a go. But if you like dark roasts though, do be warned, this is absolutely not that. This is really pretty light. Now, I'm aware in being critical of this coffee that I think it might be roasted like a little bit light in places that this is dangerous territory for me. I feel like I don't wanna do coffee reviews on this channel generally because I kind of have a coffee company and I don't wanna imply that somehow we're perfect and that I'm just criticizing everyone else. That's not really the goal, that's not what I wanna do. But this is an unusual event. It's not every day you get to drink coffee from two different YouTubers and have some fun with it. Now, before I wrap up, I do have a bunch of the Chamberlain coffee leftover. And I'll be giving away.

So if you're watching this and you want some of the Chamberlain coffee, if you're a fan of hers or you just wanna try coffee in a teabag, just leave a comment down below. I'll pick six different random comments and I'll send them coffee. How's that? Let's do that. So there you have it. Peter McKinnon versus Emma Chamberlain. For me, the McKinnon experience was just way better. It was easier to buy online, it was a more enjoyable experience. It was very expensive because of that shipping, but it was super fast. I enjoyed the coffee. I think that the detail is great. Pack looks good. Thumbs up from me. I'm a little bit impressed. My expectations were surpassed. The Chamberlain coffee, I enjoyed it a little bit less but I'm not really their target audience for that. I'm a weird coffee person. And maybe you don't have to be a weird coffee person to enjoy this. So I get it.", "videoID": "eINE82PhkJU"}, {"title": "Recipe\uff1a Coffee Soda #1", "text": "Here it is. You asked, I answered. You said stop complaining about everyone else's coffee drinks. Why don't you make one yourself? You think you can do better? Publish a recipe you said. Okay, I will. This in front of me is the first of perhaps many recipes that I'll offer of coffee sodas. Now this is a pretty simple coffee soda. This is coffee focused with a little twist in there. Before I drink this, let me tell you about the process that I went through to get to sitting here with this bottle in front of you. So we're gonna try and make a coffee soda, and there's a lot of things we need to decide along the way. Do we need to use espresso for this? Or should it be like filter coffee? I don't really know. But either way I know that the first thing I have to do is make some simple syrup. I'm gonna make a two to one syrup because this is gonna be a sweet soda. It's gonna be delicious. We need a way of adding sugar to it. Now I know one to one's easier to make, quicker to make, but I don't want the dilution later on. So it's two to one. We just wanna heat this until it dissolves basically. So nicely dissolved, let it cool down. We'll decant it in a minute, and we'll get rid of this hot plate, and we'll make some filter coffee. So let's talk about brewing coffee. I'm gonna do two different brews. I'm gonna do a pour over. Now for a pour over I'm gonna brew a little bit heavier. I want my end strength to be about 1.5%. So to do that, I'm gonna use 75 grams per liter, a heavier throw. A couple reasons, I want a bit more strength in the end brew partially because there'll be a tiny bit of dilution as we go, and also just for intensity of taste. But I'm gonna brew a pretty traditional V60. Same technique that I always use, and just make sure that the coffee is well extracted. Once that's done, I'll put it to the side and I'll let it cool down, and we can carry on with making our espresso drinks. When it comes to the espresso of choice, in fact, the coffee of choice for either of these things. I am not leaning towards a crazy, funky, fruity thing. I am leaning towards a sweet kind of classic coffee, coffee kind of thing. I think for what I have in mind for a delicious coffee soda I don't want it to be too weird. I think there's probably a recipe down the line for something weird, but not today. So I'm gonna brew a couple of espressos, a double shot. I'm gonna use 19 in, 40 grams out. And if I do a good job, I should end up with an espresso of about 9.5% strength. Now that's obviously much stronger than the filter coffee. I'm gonna dilute that down afterwards to a kind of matching dilution. 41 grams, that's workable. Now this is I'm sure a very delicious espresso, but it's got some problems when it comes to our desired use of a soda. Well, we need to filter it. We need to paper filter this espresso to get rid of any suspended material. Now that suspended material is a problem when it comes to carbonation. It provides nucleation points, and it will cause the CO2 to come out of solution. It'll make it really fizzy, and frothy, and problematic. So we have to paper filter our espresso to clean it up, get rid of all that stuff, so it's bye bye crema, bye bye any suspended material in there, we just want that clean, intense coffee flavor. To do that, all I'm gonna do is pour it through an unrinsed V60 paper and it should drain through a nice, clear liquid, which is what we want. Now, this'll often happen when you're trying to filter espresso, it'll just kind of choke, and you just have to be patient. One of the reasons it's clogging is because there's so many fine pieces from that espresso actually clogging up the filter paper. Those things that we're trying to get rid of here. Now, I tend to find that this is probably as annoying as it is, a better solution than pressing it through an aeropress. Because in that situation, I tend to find that you still get more insoluble material coming through those thin aeropress papers, especially at pressure. Okay, that's good enough for me. We could use a refractometer but I don't wanna waste any of this at this point. If we presume it's about 9.5% strength, we've got about 34 grams there, then you can work out how much soluble material is actually inside this cup. And if you want the end result to be 1.5% strength then you can do the maths about how much liquid to add, which is about 180 grams of liquid. I'm just gonna use some good tasting, clean mineral water that I like, to dilute it down. So we've got one of our two beverages here. We need to do a couple more things to it now. We need to sweeten it up, and then we need to add a few key flavors. Now I've been thinking about this, and I really don't want to get in the way of the coffee flavor. I wanna give it room to breathe, I wanna almost emphasize it. So after I've added the sugar, there's something else I wanna add just in a tiny quantity to see if it can just lift up that kind of coffee flavor, warm it up a little bit more. But first things first, our sugar syrup. So I've got 215 grams of beverage, I'm gonna add 30 grams of simple syrup, of which 20 grams of that is sugar. So it'll give me 20 out of the, what will then become 245 grams, which is about the sort of starting sweetness I wanna work with. Some soft drinks get all the way up to about 10% sugar, but they're generally counteracting quite a lot of acidity. I'm not sure we're gonna have that much acidity here and I don't wanna go too too sweet. Squeeze bottles are the best. So there is our espresso. Now we need to create the same sweetness with our filter coffee. This is a larger batch, so I'm gonna need to add more simple syrup to kinda get the same recipe. So I'm gonna add 60 grams here. To about 440 mils, meaning that we'll have about 40 grams out of 500. 'Bout 8%. Now for the next phase of testing. My theory is that a small amount, just a tiny amount of chocolate bitters will add a nice amount of bitterness to it, and also just round out the flavors, soften them up a little bit. But I don't know actually, which chocolate bitters I wanna use for this. So I've got three different ones here. We're gonna do samples in two rounds. So we'll do filter coffee first. We'll pour three filter coffees, I'll add just a little dash initially just to taste, and then see which bitters I prefer. And then run the same test with the espresso based beverage. Let's see what we got here. Okay, a little bit too much citrus. Not unpleasant. That finishes quite well. Okay, that finishes quite well. This one I'm just not into I think the Malagasy chocolate bitters, too much citrus I think it's out. This is interesting. But again too much citrus up front. This one, pretty subtle but it actually does quite nice things for the finish. This one, I think is it. I have to be careful with this though because a heavy hand is gonna mess things up. Now I'll just repeat that experiment very quickly with the espresso based version of this. Few drops. This is way too much. To put a dash into an espresso cup size is too much, but it's about flavor marriage. Nope. Dominantly, dominantly, citrus. Yeah, okay. Yes. Unquestionably, this one here. And I think having tasted the two now, I'm leaning towards the espresso version. Like a really nice amount of bitterness, a little bit of acid, nice intensity of flavor. I might actually go just a little stronger. So in that next round I might dilute that a little bit less. One more addition that I need to make up really quickly. It's a pretty simple thing to make. And that's a salt solution, a saline solution. We're gonna mix 20 grams of salt into 80 grams of water. So it's a 20% solution that way. We're gonna use just a little bit of this, 'cause just salt does wonderful things in tiny amounts where you can't really detect the saltiness of it. So we're gonna make some of that up quickly and then get it into a dropper bottle. Then I pull a fresh round of espressos. I'll strain them, I'll dilute them, and then get them down to two degrees Celsius. So now we need to talk about carbonation, which is actually so important to me. Now, one of the first things about carbonation is that you need your liquid to be cool. There's a kind of peak in carbonation in terms of the ability of water to dissolve CO2, at around two degrees Celsius. As such, what I'm gonna do is decant this into this plastic bottle that I need for carbonation. I'm gonna put a temperature probe in it, and then I'm gonna put it in the freezer so that I can track its temperature. Make sure I grab it when it hits about the right point. So it's now time, this being nice and cold to carbonate it. So what we need to do is get rid of as much air as possible 'cause that gets in the way of good carbonation. So we're just gonna squeeze a bunch of air out and put this little special cap on. And then I've got with me from home, a kind of carbonation rig, that uses like a big CO2 tank. So to our emptyish of air bottle, open that. And then we add our CO2. So this is full of CO2. What we're actually gonna do now is drain it out of CO2. We're gonna depressurize it and repressurize it again. Just 'cause we wanna make sure we've got maximum CO2, minimum air in this thing. Then we're gonna chill it a bit more and then we're gonna drink it. Let's have a little taste. It's very fizzy. Now coffee has foaming agents in it which is why you get crema, which is what's going on here. Let's just have a gentle pour. Hm. Oh that is fizzy. Okay, it's not perfect yet. Wow, that's fizzy. I love carbonation, I really do. That is really fizzy. It is in need of a bit more coffee flavor. The sweetness is about right. Could do with a touch less bitterness. Now I'm not gonna tell you too much about how that tastes, because based on what I'm tasting here, I'm gonna make some recipe tweaks. I'm gonna brew some more espresso, I'm gonna rebuild this sort of from the ground up, tweak it, make it really delicious. And then I know what I have to do. I know what I have to change. I think I can make just a really tasty, fresh coffee soda. I'm gonna do that. I'm gonna make that new batch up, gonna nail down that recipe. I'm gonna publish that recipe on my website, a website that I built with this video sponsor, which is Squarespace. Anytime I need to build a website, now, I use Squarespace.

All right, welcome back. We are ready to taste this thing. The, I hope final iteration of this thing. The recipe that will be on my website link down below. I don't have a bottle opener, so it's gonna be a screwdriver effort to get this thing open, 'cause for some reason I thought I should cap it 'cause it looked cool. And it's like a bottle of soda, should get a label next time. Jobs done. Ooh, now smell wise, you get like a little citrus and then a nice kinda coffee hit on the nose. Now this is gonna be a fresh soda. And by that I mean this isn't gonna keep for a long time. This isn't pasteurized for one, and two the coffee will begin to degrade over time. These are definitely fun to make in a batch. I would recommend doing that, but I would drink them pretty quickly before they develop that kinda stale, unpleasant coffee taste that you find in a lot of bad cold brew. To carbonate this you don't need a carbonation rig like mine, you could use a SodaStream, or you could use like a cream whipper with CO2 cartridges instead of the cream whipping cartridges that you normally use with those. There's lots of ways to carbonate. I just like to do it at high pressures in large volumes 'cause I can. Shall we have a taste. Oh yeah. Now this recipe, this drink is only as good as the espresso that you start with. Like it's a really a reflection of that thing. I didn't go with like a wacky or wild natural or anything like that. I went with a clean washed coffee that is sweet and delicious. And as a result, this beverage is sweet and delicious. Now, that little hit of citrus from those coffee bitters with that nice little chocolatey finish there, that is really yummy. This is good. This on a cold day would hit the spot. Sweetness is nice, carbonation is nice. This isn't a super high level of carbonation. I haven't gone crazy on this. If you're bored you can weigh how much CO2 you're adding, it's actually a measurable thing. Very carbonated beverages, you'll add about six grams of CO2 per liter. So you can weigh before and after carbonation, and actually see the difference. Here we're at about three I would say. So pleasantly fizzy, sparkling, but not like an angry, angry fizz. Then you can end up with a kind of a raspy, a harsher kind of carbonation that I don't think this really warrants or actually works that well with coffee. This is pretty good. At this point what would I change? What would I improve? I'm pretty happy with this. I think it's pretty good. It's restricted by having to be fresh but it's nonetheless pretty enjoyable. If I could find a slightly less citrusy chocolate bitters that was a little bit more classic chocolate, I might use that over this one. I think this works really well and it gives it a kind of interesting coffee cola quality that's quite nice. But I could do with a little bit more chocolate. You could probably add some caramel color for more of a classic cola look if you wanted to do that. But this, it's pretty good, I think you should try it. If you do try it, then I want you to tell me what coffee you used in it.", "videoID": "f1vmP-QAA8Y"}, {"title": "Drinking Espresso from the 1950s", "text": "Leaf\" by Nick Box)  - Hi there. Hopefully your first question is, why am I sat in a park? And I have a good answer for that. Today is a very exciting day. And I think a day a lot of you are excited about as well, 'cause I'm gonna get to taste something very, very old. Let me explain. I was recently contacted by a young man called Ben, who had found some family coffee dating back to the 1950s. And it was his family who roasted the coffee, but I'll let him explain in a minute. Now he said, did I wanna taste this? And I said, of course I wanna taste this. But he had one condition, which I think was very fair. And that was that he was here when we opened the tin and when we tasted it. Now, initially, I was gonna do that in the studio, but COVID restrictions would make that kind of reckless. So here we are in Hampstead Heath with a lovely view, some coffee equipment on a camping table, to taste some coffee from the 1950s. And to tell you a little bit more about the coffee, I'm gonna hand you now to Ben to give you the backstory. - My name's Ben Schofield. I'm from Oxford, but I live in London now. And this is my relative's coffee. So this was started by my great great great grandfather Adam McKinlay out of Glasgow. I think in the early to mid-1800s. And then his son, Thomas McKinlay, who I have a lovely picture of, he traveled up to Sao Paulo and he was selling machine lace, hatchets and also hand mills. And in return, on the ships that he sent up there, they were loaded up with coffee and they were sent back to the UK, where they roasted and distributed it under the names of Rio One and McKinlay's Extra. This tin I believe, is no younger than 70 years old. It has been sat in my great grandparents' cupboard for probably, it was probably about 20 to 30 years of its life, and then was moved to my grandparents' house where I found it, and then decided that you might want to try it. - So now we have the tin. Here it is in my hands, and if you shake it. I think it's beans. It sounds like beans. It's been pointed out. If it's not beans, that's terrifying. So, let's open it up. Oh. So this is great news in that we are sealed. This is airtight, which stands at a reasonable chance. So it looks like there's a little mechanism here where there's a little tooth here. I'm gonna try and bend it down and then push it into the can and then see if we can twist it round to open the can. I think that's what we're supposed to do. So I think I'm supposed to just bend this out. Oh. So you're pointing down. Just go a little bit more, a little bit more. This is terrifying. Again, there are people out there who believe that this should go to Antiques Roadshow and never be drunk, and they're wrong. I'm gonna go back the other way now. Ooh. There's a mixture of smells. There's definitely some age in this. I'm just gonna pry this open a little bit with my thing. We've got two layers here, which is super interesting. So there's like, this top tin layer that's quite thin. And then underneath, what appears to be paper? I think that's instant, I think that's instant coffee. That doesn't smell bad. I honestly felt this would smell much worse. It's got a... little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, a little bit of... Quite a lot of chocolate actually, that's really interesting. It's sweet smelling. It doesn't smell great. There's also something about the smell that's totally wrong and terrifying. And you know, I'm glad that boiling water acts as a pasteurizing agent here. But here we go. All right, we're drinking it. We're drinking it. I brought the necessary tools just in case, but I think we got some instant. Hey, buddy, how're you doing now? Now I'm extremely confused by the contents of this tin. And I came prepared to pull shots of espresso. I'm actually prepared to do a kind of pour over as well, because I was warned in advance of the kind of instructions on the back of this thing. Now it does say, measure out coffee required on the basis of one heaped tablespoon for each two cups. Boil water in a saucepan, remove from the fire. Pour in the coffee. Stir vigorously, vigorously. Return to the fire, remove immediately. Give a final brisk stir. pour full content through a fine muslin strainer into a previously heated pot, serve black, piping hot. Missing some punctuation. Anyway, the point is that the presence of a strainer implies there's stuff in here, that it's not just instant coffee, it might be instant coffee and bits, it might be something else. I have no idea. So as a first test, I'm gonna fire up the Jetboil, boil some water, and then just in a shot glass, see if this dissolves. See if bits stay behind, just so we can understand what we've got. And then probably brew the way that this suggests to brew. I'm terrified. It's not instant. It's definitely got bits. Doesn't smell as good now. I'm not tasting this like this. I'm not drinking with the bits in. All right, let's brew it, as is the traditional way. Let's get a pot of water on the boil. Let's get a bunch of coffee in it. And let's strain it through a cloth filter, which I have with me. And then it's tasting time. We've got some boiling water. Now I'm gonna add, what was the measure? I'm supposed to add one heaped tablespoon. So I'm gonna do maybe two or three of these. Making a mess, but that's okay. I think I give it a brisk stir, or is that later? Vigorous stir at this point. So a vigorous stir. And then I'm gonna pour it. Got my little travel set up, these are interesting little things. I'm gonna pour it through a little cloth filter. Sadly, today was not to be your day hand grinder. Oh, wait, one more stir. Get all that flavor. There is a little foam on this, which is kind of surprising. That's enough, I don't need a lot. This is not my morning brew. Just... it's a whole other smell. I don't think this smells like coffee, this smells like a whole other thing. I only brought espresso cups because I'm not planning on drinking a mug of this. It looks a bit weak, for which I'm not entirely upset. And... Here's one for Ben. I think the rain has temporarily paused so I can luxuriate in this cup of coffee that is old. 1950s. If it's grounds, maybe we should try grinding it very fine and pulling a shot after this. I think maybe we should. Oh dear God. That's really... That's bad, that's really bad. That is... I don't think I'm gonna throw up, you know, what I mean? Like, I'm not there. Like, I don't think this is necessarily helpful, but it is pasteurized. I tell myself that every sip. It's got this acidity that is weird and papery. And it's got this cacao nib thing in there as well that should be pleasant but is just unwelcome at this party. I think I'm done, I think I'm done drinking that. Let's make an espresso out of it, what could be more sensible? But before I pull a shot of espresso, I have to talk to you about a couple of things. Now, it's obviously been a tough time for people around the world. And over the last few months I've been doing a coffee giveaway, where anytime there's a sponsored video, I would give away 10 bags of coffee to people who need it around the world. And I gave away, I think around 200 bags of coffee, but I really feel I need to go further. Starting today, with this video, for the next 10 videos, I'll be giving away five grinders per video. Each of them a Baratza Encore. Thanks to Baratza for helping me out. I still bought these grinders but they helped make the logistics possible. This means that everyone has a warranty for the grinder they receive, but it does mean there are only 37 countries that we can actually ship them to at the end. So if you enter the competition, link is down below, then just know that there are some restrictions around where we can ship them. This is a competition for people who are down on their luck, who are having a hard time, who need a grinder. If you can afford a grinder, please go and support a local business and buy one. But if you can't afford a grinder and you're eligible, click the link down in the description and we'll give away five every video for the next 10 sponsored videos. And actually in this video, it's gonna be six, because I'm gonna give a brand new grinder to Ben. A nice little upgrade for your set up to say thank you for kind of giving me this very rare opportunity for which I'm very grateful. And all of this is possible because this video has a sponsor, which is Squarespace. If you need to build a website or a domain then I would strongly recommend using Squarespace.

I have a little Flair PRO with me just to up the ante a little bit. I got my Jetboil, so I can boil some water. So I'm gonna grind some coffee, tamp it down and see if I can pull a shot with this, because I know all of you in the comments want me to drink an espresso from the 1950s. This is the weirdest grind profile I've ever seen in my life. Okay. It's a simple light roast, which is interesting. So, I'm not gonna lie. This is probably a very stupid thing to do, to try and do a sort of manual espresso on a camping table. I feel like that's probably not what the smarter people of the world do. So, I'm just gonna fill you. Piston in. Ooh. We got some pressure. Not the greatest looking show if I'm honest. Might've gone a bit fine. Got the grind about right it would seem. So, like a... Like a scummy foamy layer of... So, espresso from the 1950s, 70 years to get to this moment in a park in London with an idiot. Cheers. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Mm-mm. Oh. Oh. Oh no. That was bad, that was... that was really bad. That was a terrible mistake. Oh wow. I kind of wanna go again, but I don't. Oh, the finish. It keeps going. It's like metal and battery acid, and pain. That is traumatic. My taste buds may never forgive me for what just happened there. I don't know if I'll ever taste again. Ugh, Should I taste it again? One more sip, one more sip. I don't know why, but one more sip. Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm. I think if I drank that I would throw up, that's how I feel about that. So there it is. That is coffee from the 1950s, brewed and pulled as an espresso. Got to be honest, never again. Never, ever, ever again. If you have some of this stuff lying around in your house, if you discover it in your grandparents' basement or attics or somewhere, maybe just keep hold of it. Maybe just keep it sealed. Maybe just look at it from time to time. Maybe don't don't crack it open and drink it. That's my advice to you. But I'd love to hear from you down in the comments below. Did I miss out here? Did I not do it the way I should have done? Was an espresso ridiculous? Are you fearing for my safety? Don't worry, I'm fine. I'm really fine. Some of you are gonna freak out, we're pasteurized, we're okay. The tin was sealed, we're okay.", "videoID": "3EHQ_a1334c"}, {"title": "Caffeine\uff1a Explained", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about caffeine. It's the most widely consumed psychoactive drug in the world, most commonly consumed as coffee. And we're all familiar with the effects of caffeine but what exactly is caffeine? Why do plants produce it? What does it do to our bodies and is it good for you? Now, from a chemical perspective, caffeine can be described as both a methylxanthine and an alkaloid. The first name refers to the shape and composition of the caffeine molecule while alkaloids as a whole are a broader group of naturally occurring organic compounds, defined by having at least one nitrogen atom. Alkaloids have many functions and effects but almost all are bitter in taste. Caffeine occurs naturally in more than 60 different plants but more surprising then that is that those plants each develop different biochemical mechanisms and pathways to create caffeine. This is a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. Most people associate caffeine with coffee and it is named for coffee but it also occurs in tea, chocolate, kola nuts, guarana seeds and even the flowers of citrus plants. Plants produce caffeine primarily as a pesticide. It deters insects from attacking or eating the plant, in part with its bitter taste, but caffeine is also toxic to some herbivore insects. It does also have one super interesting function. Studies have shown that caffeine can improve the memory of bees, helping them create a stronger association between the smell of a coffee flower and its sweet nectar. This might be why caffeine exists in very low concentrations in the nectar of certain flowers, like the citrus flowers we mentioned before. It gives those plants a competitive advantage in the world of pollination. Human consumption of caffeine likely starts back in 3,000 B.C. with the consumption of tea. And tea, gram for gram, has more caffeine than coffee but we just use more coffee when we make a cup. The beginning of coffee consumption is a little bit harder to pinpoint but by the middle of the 15th century, we're pretty confident that coffee drinking had taken hold in Yemen and the surrounding areas. With both tea and coffee, very early records shows that people liked it for the stimulating properties of caffeine. Credit for the discovery of caffeine is not quite clear cut. In 1819, a German chemist named Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge isolated what he called kaffebase, a nearly pure caffeine extract. He did this work apparently at the suggestion of the famous writer, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Runge is also notable for having been the first to isolate quinine and also for the invention of paper chromatography. In 1821, it was discovered independently by French chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet to whom caffeine's discovery had traditionally, historically been credited. It was also discovered at the same time by two other French chemists working together, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaime Caventou. Pelletier was the first to use the word caffeine in print, though Robiquet was the first to isolate and describe the properties of pure caffeine. In that pure form, caffeine is a white, crystalline powder that has a pretty bitter taste. If you take a large enough dose, it's toxic but in lower doses, if you look at how it affects humans, you start to understand its enduring popularity. Now, most people consume caffeine by drinking coffee and it's absorbed initially through the gastrointestinal tract and then 30 to 60 minutes after consumption, that's when it reaches peak concentrations in the body. Let's get into some biology here. Now, caffeine affects the body with three different mechanisms. Firstly, caffeine blocks the receptors in the body for a compound called adenosine. Under normal circumstances, adenosine triggers these receptors and it produces a feeling of relaxation and even drowsiness for some people. And so caffeine prevents this from happening, while also causing the body to increase production of dopamine and noradrenaline. This is the mechanism behind most of the effects that we all experience with caffeine, this inhibition of adenosine. It happens at relatively low doses and gives us that feeling of wakefulness or alertness that we associate with a cup of coffee. This mechanisms might also explain the kind of caffeine crash that many people experience with a sudden feeling of tiredness and exhaustion. It might be that once the body metabolizes all of the caffeine, then the adenosine is finally able to trigger those receptors and really, really make us feel tired and drowsy. Caffeine also causes the release of calcium inside of muscle cells and it can prevent or slow its reuptake. This increased availability of calcium increases the power output of the muscles but it does require a pretty large dose to occur, around 500 milligrams for an average person. Caffeine can inhibit what are called phosphodiesterase, now, if you stop these enzymes working properly, then you can actually cause the body to burn more fat. But for this to work, it also requires a much larger dose than people would typically get from drinking a few cups of coffee in a day. Caffeine affects the central nervous system. Caffeine makes us feel more alert, more awake and has been shown to improve memory. However, the beneficial effects of caffeine aren't as clear cut as we would like. Several studies have now shown that that improved mental clarity that we get when we drink coffee in the morning, well, that comes from alleviating our withdrawal symptoms, rather than actually improving our cognitive functions. One positive impact is the increasing evidence for caffeine's ability to act as both a treatment for some aspects of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as having some preventative properties as well. Now, caffeine could be said to be the last legal performance-enhancing drug but it wasn't always this way. Between 1984 and 2004, caffeine was actually on the Olympic Committee's banned list. If they tested your urine and you were at a higher concentration than 12 micrograms per milliliter, you were out. And to hit that level, you could do it with just five to eight cups of coffee in the morning. And because people metabolize caffeine differently, this was ultimately an unfair thing to police and after 2004, it was off the banned list. Now, as we talked about before, caffeine does affect the muscles, it does affect power output but it does seem less effective with habitual users of caffeine. Though it does impact the perception of exertion and fatigue, which is kind of interesting. For people using caffeine for sport, they're typically dosing three to five milligrams per kilo of body weight. Now, not everyone has a positive experience with caffeine and we do need to talk about that. Symptoms like mild anxiety, jitteriness, insomnia, reduced coordination, these are all symptoms people can suffer with even mild caffeine consumption. Caffeine can have a negative effect on anxiety disorders and doses above 300 milligrams can worsen someone's anxiety. However, lower, more moderate doses have been shown to be associated with reduced symptoms of depression. Consuming coffee regulatory does leave you susceptible to experiencing caffeine withdrawal if you stop suddenly. Now, most people can experience a big headache that can last a little while. They can become irritable, fatigued, some can get flu-like symptoms or struggle to concentrate. Typically these symptoms will last for up to 24 hours, though occasionally, it can go on for longer and people have experienced caffeine withdrawal for up to three days. So how much caffeine exactly is considered healthy? Recommendations are quite broad because people respond to and metabolize caffeine a little bit differently but current guidelines are for an adult, it's no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day. And that's 200 milligrams if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Soft drinks, energy drinks, tea are all popular sources of caffeine but coffee is by far the most popular. But with soft drinks and energy drinks, there is typically a fixed and known amount of caffeine in them. You can look up on the internet how much coffee is in a can of Coca-Cola. With coffee, you can't. A cup of coffee will have quite a dramatic variance in its caffeine content, depending on a number of factors. The coffee itself will play a role. Arabica has half the caffeine content of Robusta but the recipe or the way that it was brewed, these will all have an impact. And they've gone and done tests and bought coffees from different cafes and there's been a pretty wide range reported, anywhere from around 65 up to over 300 milligrams in a single cup. Various governments and governing bodies have tried a few times to legislate coffee companies to have them tell you exactly how much caffeine is in your coffee-related product but so far, that's never happened. It's always been successfully lobbied against. Excessive caffeine consumption can be quite unpleasant and actually, it can be fatal. To reach caffeine toxicity, you'd have to ingest around 10 grams of pure caffeine in a day. To do that, you'd have to drink between 50 and 100 cups of coffee. So it's actually pretty rare that anyone reaches that from drinking coffee. More often, people have died from caffeine intoxication from consuming too many caffeine pills or other medications that may contain caffeine. I think for those of us who drink and enjoy coffee all the time, it's really important to understand a bit more about caffeine.", "videoID": "j805qJJajmM"}, {"title": "A Beginner's Guide to Coffee Grinders", "text": "Welcome to today's video, which is a beginner's guide to coffee grinders. Because there's a lot of different coffee grinders out there which is the right one for you? Which one meets your needs? Which is the best value for money? Now, what we're gonna do today is cover a little bit of theory at the start on coffee grinding, right? Understanding what's going on, why it's something worth worrying about, why it's something we're spending money on a bit of equipment to do it. And then in the second half, we'll talk through all of these grinders here and talk through the features that you get, what happens when you spend more money and you, I hope at the end of it, will feel well-equipped to buy a coffee grinder that meets your needs and have even better tasting coffee every morning. One quick thing, I'm not gonna necessarily recommend specific models, nor review specific models in this video. Where I've talked about grinders before they'll be links down in the description, you can watch those. I've done a number of different videos on particular grinders. Today, these are kind of representative grinders of different technologies or different features just to kind of explain what's happening when you spend more money. But let's start with the theory. Let's start with what happens when we grind coffee. Why we grind coffee in the first place. Now our whole coffee bean is a wonderful thing, but it doesn't make a good tasting coffee. Water cannot get to all of the flavor 'cause it could only sort of get to the very outside of the bean. And so if you put whole beans in hot water some flavor will come out, but really not very much. And so we grind it, we smash it into little tiny pieces because what we're concerned about first and foremost is exposing sort of more surface area. And the finer you grind anything, the more surface area that you have, and the easier it is for the water to get in there, dissolve the flavor out, get it into your cup of coffee and for you to have a better more delicious cup at the end of it. Now, one of the big sells you'll hear for a coffee grinder is that freshness is actually a really key aspect of grinding coffee. And that's true, when you smash coffee, you expose all of the surface area and it means everything that you've exposed can begin to go stale. And there are three ways in which coffee goes stale. The first and to me kind of saddest is the idea that you just lose those flavors. They go, what's called volatilely, float off into the atmosphere and those flavors and aromas essentially wander off. You'll smell them for a minute and then you won't get to drink them later. So that's kind of a thing. So the older coffee is the more flavor essentially just loses to the air, to the atmosphere. The second thing that happens is that you have what are called sort of staling reactions where different compounds combine with each other and begin to create new flavors that often aren't particularly nice. And so after a little while your coffee will taste measurably worse as well as being less interesting. And then the third thing is oxidation. And that'll happen to sort of some of the fats and oils inside coffee, they will oxidize and essentially begin to go rancid. It's not a great smell or taste rancid oil, and rancid oil in all forms smells a little bit fishy and that's true with coffee. So very old, very stale, rancid coffee is not something I would recommend. And the best way to avoid all of those things is really only to smash the coffee bean to pieces when you want to immediately then brew it, that way you capture a lot more flavor, you have less loss of quality, it's just a better time all around. Now occasionally on the internet you'll see a thing that says pre-ground coffee from a very, very, very good commercial grinder will make better coffee in many cases, than fresh ground coffee from a very cheap coffee grinder. And that's an interesting test and study that was done. I think it ignores some of the other reasons to buy a coffee grinder. We'll get to in a second, but really what isn't to be underestimated is just the pleasure of grinding coffee. In that moment, there is an enormous release of smell that is fantastic. That moment of grinding coffee bit in the morning, first thing, or in the afternoon it's a pleasure not to be missed. So from that perspective alone, a coffee grinder is worth having. And if you own a pepper grinder of any kind, then you owe it to yourself to own a coffee grinder too, if you drink coffee. Now, the second thing that gets talked about a lot is called grind uniformity. And that's the idea that when you grind coffee, ideally, the little pieces that you make should all be the same size. Because when you come to prepare them later, brew them into a cup of coffee, the more uniform the size is, the better they'll give up their flavor in a more uniform way. And that makes sense from anything in the kitchen if you're trying to cook some potatoes, if you cook a little tiny piece of potato and a whole potato, they'll cook at very different rates and they probably won't cook well together. Same thing with coffee grinding, right? If you are trying to brew loads of little tiny pieces of coffee, alongside loads of very big pieces of coffee, you'll get a lot of flavor out of the tiny pieces and not very much out of the other pieces. And this can result in a very unbalanced, unpleasant cup of coffee. Those tiny pieces can add some bitterness, those giant pieces can add some sourness, and those two things combined are not how I wanna start my day. So as we talk through grinders you'll hear me reference this idea of grind uniformity. And it is important, it helps you make better tasting coffee to have the pieces be a very similar size. You'll have less unbalanced, less unpleasant cups of coffee, more delicious cups of coffee. Now the third aspect of coffee grinders that's very important of coffee grinding that's very important is grind size control. The ideal grind size for espresso is very different from the ideal grind size for something like a French press, for example, right? With espresso, you want lots and lots of very fine small pieces because you're gonna extract that coffee with very little liquid to make it very strong. With a French press, you might wanna grind it a little bit coarser. So being able to control the grind size is really, really, really important, particularly so in espresso, but we'll touch on that a little bit later. So that's it, that's the key information to think about as we go into looking at these different grinders, it'll help us to understand why you might wanna spend a bit more money here or there.

So let's start with these 10 grinders in front of me. Let's start at the beginning with the cheapest grinder on offer, which is this it's a blade grinder. And these can be had for like 20 pounds, they're very cheap, they're very simple things. You've got a little motor and that's attached to some spinning blades inside here. And when you turn the grinder on they spin really, really quickly and essentially those blades, they're not really sharp they kind of just smash the coffee down into little pieces. The longer you run it, the finer the coffee will be. But the problem with these, is that you really don't have any control meaningfully over grind size. To have really the same grind size every time is quite tricky, and to have a uniform grind size is extremely unlikely. This kind of act of violence of just smashing the coffee beans instead of cutting them creates a lot of very fine pieces that can add a lot of muddiness and bitterness and kind of dullness to your cup of coffee in the morning. I'm not saying you can't enjoy coffee made with a blade grinder, and there's some hacks you can do too to improve the quality of its output that's linked up here. If you're enjoying coffee with a blade grinder now, you could really, really be enjoying your coffee a lot more with a better grinder that offers you a little bit more control and uniformity. If you own one of these and you're upgrading from it, do not throw it away they make for fantastic spice grinders, they are useful to have around. But to grind coffee they are a little bit frustrating. So then we move from what are called blade grinders into the rest of these, which are called burr grinders. So inside these, you've got two cutting discs, one spins against the other and controlling the distance between the two controls how big the pieces are when they finally get out of the grinder into the collection bin below where you're gonna sort of take them and then pour them into your brewery or whatever you're gonna do with them. This is a classic kind of entry-level hand grinder. It's relatively cheap, it's about 40 pounds. And a lot of people choose to start their sort of grinding journey here with one of these 'cause it's not a huge investment. And that's true, you'll have some control of the grind setting. In something like this, you kind of control the burr distance. This is a conical burr grinder. So you've got a kind of cone-shaped main burr that spins inside this thing. Conical burrs are popular and a lot of grinders they have a larger cutting surface which helps you to kind of grind more coffee through kind of per turn, which is useful. This is in contrast to what are called flat burr grinders. We have two discs or rings of cutting teeth, one spins against the other, same control mechanism you just move them further apart for a coarser grind or closer together for a finer grind. Now the burrs and cheaper hand grinders especially tend to be made of ceramic. This is a cheaper material to produce. They don't cut quite as cleanly. So your grind uniformity isn't quite as good as a metal burr, but as an entry-level thing, they work okay. What you tend to see also in cheaper burr grinders is a little bit of wobbling from that bottom burrs that's grinding. 'Cause it's not stabilized super well because they're trying to keep costs down. That will also result in a less uniform cup of coffee. So if you look at going from say 40 pounds up to 100 pounds, right? You've got the same basic technology. You're gonna be doing the work here. You are turning, you're working to crush the coffee between those burrs. Now, here you go from a plastic construction to a metal construction, and you go from ceramic burrs to metal burrs. So it's a big jump in quality going from 40 pounds to say 100 pounds. Now with the previous grinder and this grinder and the next grinder too, they are what's called stepped grinders, where you adjust the grind here at the bottom by fixed amounts. This is sort of a step that kind of clicks into place. And that's a controlled movement. That means that you've got pretty good control of a ground size, but not infinite control in a way. And later on, we'll talk about stepless grinders. But for the purposes here, steps work very well, they're repeatable, they're useful to have. This will do a better job grinding coffee than the 40 pound grinder, by a good amount actually. By not needing a motor, by having you do the hard work you can kind of invest a bit more in the other things like the burr quality and get better results for less money. The downside of course, is that you have to do the grinding every time, every morning. And if you're growing a lot of coffee that can take a while and it is hard work grinding the coffee is relatively physical. That can change with more expensive grinders or bigger grinders, but ultimately hand grinding is something you have to kind of enjoy doing. As you go from 100 pounds up to something much more expensive in the hand grinder world, generally, you're getting an increase in construction. Again, this is better made, this feels solid, it's great materials, but really you're could be paying for better grind uniformity. And that's what more expensive hand grinders generally offer. And at this price point the grinds coming from this are very, very good. And you can grind effectively for espresso with an expensive hand grinder, it's really hard work, but you can do it or you can grind for filter coffee pretty well. So that's kind of what you've spent with hand grinders going from something pretty cheap, cheaper materials, cheaper burr construction, less uniformity, and that's what's increased as you've gone up and up and up. So there are lots of reasons to have a hand grinder. It might be that you travel a lot, it might be that you like camping, it might be that just you enjoy that whole thing. But if you are at home you're grinding coffee every single day, then I would recommend investing in an electric coffee grinder. And that's where we start here. So this grinder here is cheaper than this hand grinder. It's a little bit more expensive than this grinder here, but it's a great way to start the day. You have an electric motor in there and that spinning a conical burr set. And that's what you tend to see at entry-level decent home electric grinder price points. Now cheaper grinders will have cheaper motors and because grinding coffee is hard work, a cheaper motor will overcome the sort of power needed to crush those beans by just spinning faster. So you'll tend to see cheaper grinders have faster RPMs on their motors. They don't always grind coffee through the burrs quicker, but they will generally be a little bit louder. That motor spinning generates some noise, if it's spinning very fast, the way it cuts coffee you'll just get a bit more noise in the morning. This grinder, as you tend to see at this price point is a stepped grinder. So you've got fixed steps and it's not really able to do espresso, right? We talked about having a cheaper motor spinning a bit faster, but when you're grinding very, very, very fine you need a lot of power, you need a lot of talk in that motor and cheaper motors just can't do it. So you tend to see cheaper grinders like this are great if you need filter coffee, but not great if you're trying to brew espresso. If you look at say a filter dedicated grinder at about 125 pounds going up to say 250 pounds, then you see a variation in the features that's kind of interesting. This grinder was initially designed to hold like a bag of coffee in the hopper here and have a little timer on the side that you would adjust it, you'd push go and it would grind for a fixed amount of time to dispense the amount of coffee that you wanted. But that's not how many people want a coffee grinder to work. You want what's called a single dose grinder. Where you're gonna put in what you need and no more in terms of coffee beans for that drink, that batch, whatever it's gonna be. It might be that you wanna keep the coffee stored and sealed away and not sitting in the grinder. It might be that have more than one coffee at home and you wanna vary one bean to the next. A grinder like this is designed to be a single-dose grinder. You can't really fit that much coffee on the top here, so you'd only pour in what you'd need. Instead of having a timer this has an auto shutoff that stops the grinder when it's no longer grinding coffee. This grinder, like this grinder is a stepped grinder. So you've got fixed increments that you can adjust the grind size by. And this grinder is also a filter coffee only grinder, it's motor it's set up is really built around filter coffee and not espresso. What you tended to see historically was when you need espresso you had a dedicated espresso style grinder. And this is a pretty good example. It's a bit of a jump in price because you've got a more substantial motor in there and this is about I think 350 pounds which is some pretty serious money. Now this is designed really to be a dedicated espresso grinder. And it's a little bit more traditional in its design, which means it's got a large hopper on top to again, hold a big bag of coffee beans in there and grind what you need when you need it. Many people choose not to do that as I said, and use this as single dose, though you'd probably wanna replace this hopper with something more appropriate. What you see as you go from a filter coffee dedicated grinder to an espresso dedicated grinder is not just the ability to grind finer, but you tend to see stepless adjustment, right? Where you control the finest or the coarseness it's usually just a wheel that you can move as little or as much as you want. Espresso requires very small adjustments to grind in size to have quite a substantial change in the way that the coffee brews. So you want as much control as is possible. So that's what you tend to see in a dedicated espresso grinder. This will grind using time. So you push go and it'll grind for say 9.2 seconds to give you a consistent dose of coffee. This kind of grinder, you can buy in a huge number of different configurations from different manufacturers. You'll have different motor sizes, different burrs sizes, different burr shapes, you know, different kind of technologies controlling how much coffee it grinds as it grinds. But the base principle is kind of there. If you're grinding for espresso you need that more powerful motor and that tends to mean you need to spend more money and that's where your money is going. Now, these two grinders are emblematic of more modern approaches to grinders. This kind of grinder has existed for 60, if not 70 years now. These are much newer, as you'll see they're both grind to order grinders they have no real space to hold much coffee, they'll hold a single dose under no more, but they're also designed to go all the way from coarser filter grinds through to very fine espresso grinds. This one is a flat burr grinder and this one is a conical burr grinder. This one is a little bit cheaper I think at about 400 pounds, this one is a little bit more expensive at 500 pounds. Feature wise, they're both very similar you're grinding into a little collection bin that you might then use to pour into a pour-over or pour directly into a portafilter if you're making a espresso. Now the difference of price between the two might come down to the design and construction of these, the materials used or the components used, it might also come down to their approach to things like retention. Now retention isn't something that we've talked about yet but it is something that's actually very important and you'll see discussed in a lot of different grinder reviews. When you put coffee beans into a grinder it'll go into a chamber that holds the cutting discs those spin, those push out the grounds, ideally all of them, but typically not quite all of them. There might be anywhere from 0.2 of a gram to two grams or even sometimes more stuck inside the grinder that the mechanism is unable to completely push out. Now with more traditional designs like this one that wasn't considered a huge issue because, you know, it'll be pushed out when you grind for coffee the next time. The downside is when you change your grind you'll have some of the retained old grind setting that you would need to purge out. That's a little bit wasteful and the more you need to purge out with a grinder, the more wasteful that grinder is. Some commercial grinders can need 20 or 30 grams purging, not acceptable, but that's how things were for a long time. More modern solutions might need a couple of grams, if anything at all. So design around retention is really a key thing. Here you've got quite a different approach, the retention is dealt with by the sort of innate design of the burr chamber. Here you've got a bellows where you'd push down that would blow air through the grinding chamber pushing out the last bit of coffee into the collection cup below. That's the kind of idea there. How a grinder deals with retention, be it bellows or be it a little knocker on the side of it is something you should think about, and decide how you wanna spend your money because it will impact your kind of workflow in the morning. Do you wanna have to go and clack a thing a few times or press the bellows a few times? If it doesn't bother you and it saves you some money, then it's worth considering. But retention is important and retention is discussed a lot when you watch other reviews of grinders on YouTube or read about them on websites. So the understanding I think is really, really, really key. Now, one last note on conical versus flat burrs and I don't want to get too deeply into an esoteric discussion here, but some people believe that conical burrs suit espresso a little bit more. That having a little bit more diversity of size of particle can help give some more texture, some more body to your espresso. Other people prefer sort of flat burr style espresso where you have a little bit more clarity, maybe more sweetness, but not quite as much texture. Understanding that is a consideration if you're getting into the fine end of dialing into espresso, when you've got a great machine and you want a great grinder to match it. But if it's your first grinder it's not something you necessarily need to obsess about until your technique and other aspects of coffee making catch up to that. Now, one last note on burrs is that some grinders have options for different burrs that you can install. Grinders like this or this, you can install different burrs from different manufacturers that will give you different results. If you are shopping for a grinder and you're kind of wanting to future-proof it, considering a grinder that has some options for a grinder burrs is one thing to maybe just bear in mind as you're shopping. That's not essential, but it is a kind of nice to have, if you're thinking about buying a grinder that's gonna last you for a really long time without worrying about needing to constantly upgrade. Now, these nine grinders I have here are I think viable first-time purchases, even though we've gone all the way up to 500 pounds. I could see this still being someone's first coffee grinder at home. I did want to include a little bit more just to explain how people can end up spending enormous amounts of money on coffee grinders for what they're chasing. Now, this grinder in the end is incredibly expensive it's three and a half thousand dollars but I think it's a good example of how far people will go in the chase for better uniformity, better construction or better design or better build, more control here you've got variable RPM. I can change the speed of my motor to achieve different results in how it grinds. The workflow is kind of different and very nice. It's beautiful, I can easily switch the burrs out in it. You know, these kind of details are what you end up paying for. Now understand that going from a more entry-level grinder to something like this is a big leap in quality and a great return on your investment. Going from someone like this, up to someone like this, is an increasing quality, but it's a smaller leap, it's more incremental increase for a lot more money. And that's true of most things in this world, right? Like the closer you get to sort of the end goal, the more expensive and the more difficult it is to do any sort of an upgrade. I'm not saying this is bad value for money, but if you're looking at spending a lot of money on the coffee grinder, you really have to have some very specific problems that only it will solve for you. As a final note, these look like they go from sort of the lowest quality to the highest quality, but that isn't quite true. Hand grinders are a cheaper way to achieve better quality, better grind uniformity at lower prices 'cause you don't have to spend money on the motor, so you're just spending on burr and construction generally. So that is the beginner's guide to coffee grinders. And it's there a hope to help you build a little flow chart for you and your needs and your budget. If you've got 300 pounds and you want a filter coffee grinder, then I can help you get to where you need to go based on your needs. Do you want absolute quality for the money or do you want electric motor to help you do some of the work? These are questions I can't answer for you, but hopefully now you can answer them for yourself and make a better decision. And do know there are still things that we haven't talked about here that are little details that are worth looking out for in reviews. Things like the, not just the loudness of a grinder, but the quality of sound.", "videoID": "bgjvLQu5NlE"}, {"title": "Understanding the Moka Pot (Episode #2)", "text": "Warning, this video gets very, very nerdy. Today we're gonna dive into the science of how a moka pot works. And to be honest I thought this was gonna be easy. I thought this was gonna be fun. I thought that this little ubiquitous Italian brewer that everyone uses, everyone can use, it's gotta be simple, right? Wrong, really wrong. This thing broke me intellectually, emotionally. It just destroyed me. And I wanna tell you the journey that I've been through trying to understand the moka pot. So you might've seen that we've done an understanding before, we did an understanding of the AeroPress. This one is gonna be a little bit different because with the AeroPress I could brew as part of the whole video, and it was kind of easy and quick. Here, not so much. One brew can take quite a long time. And so going through all the brews just isn't practical. So for the last week we've been doing a ton of research. I'm gonna talk you through the tools that we've had to do that research. Firstly, let me show you the Franken-moka. So this is a Franken-moka setup ready to go as it would be. And you can see there's a sort of mess of cables coming off it. There's tubes, there's these weird gauges, there's quite a lot going on. So this rig, these two pots actually, were both built by Gabor from SEP. Very grateful to him for all the work he did. He did an amazing job. There's actually a video of him building these pots, I linked to that down below if you wanna watch it too. Now as for how the pots actually work there's three temperature probes, and one pressure sensor on the pot. Two probes are here, and they're actually running into the base of the unit, into the water reservoir of the base. One of them sits under water, and we'll give you kind of your water temperature reading. The other one kind of goes up through the funnel to just below where the coffee sits, and this should give us a kind of brew temperature in a way. The other probe sits here on the side, and that's monitoring the temperature of the upper chamber. We'll talk about why that's important later. Off the side here you can also see a little tube running to a pressure gauge, so we have a sort of manual reading of what's going on. And then this transducer that then connects to my telephone, so I can have a live pressure reading to .01 of a bar second-by-second as the whole brew happens. Now he did one more mod which is this thing here, this little tube. What that's doing is essentially taking the coffee as it brews away from the pot so we can collect it somewhere else. This means that with the SEP app we can look at the flow of liquid through the bed of coffee. We get a kind of flow rates to track. So we get a lot of data points. Beyond that we're tracking the amount of coffee that we put in, the amount of liquid in total that we get out. We're doing extraction measurements here with a VST refractometer. So for every brew before we've even tasted it we've collected a huge amount of data. Now I'm super grateful that Gabor did two pots because this one is set up very slightly differently. And this is important for the first test that we'll be doing. I took off the flow tube here, and instead put another temperature probe in down that thing to try and get just above where the coffee is leaving the sort of filter basket part of it, and flowing up that tube to kind of get a temperature of brewed coffee from that. That was interesting. A little bit tricky, but it was another useful data point. I have to say having had two pots has been amazing because they're a little bit finicky to work with I'm not gonna lie, and being able to reset one while another is brewing was super, super helpful. I was able to brew with these pots in a way that I wouldn't be able to without all of the data. You can do really cool interesting things that you can't do without temperature and pressure sensors on there, so if you want one of these you're in luck. At Gabor's request we're gonna raffle these off. There's a link down below. We're gonna raise money for World Coffee Research. If you're not familiar they're a nonprofit focusing on the long-term survival of specialty coffee on the producer side. So they're, they're not focused on roasting coffee they're just on growing coffee. For you if you donate $3 or more you enter a raffle to win one of these things. I'll ship it anywhere in the world that I can. Link down below. So thank you to Gabor for his work, his donations. And if you want one of these, and I tell you, you kinda do if you like moka pots, then the link's in the description. Let's get on to some actual testing. So the way today's gonna work is I'm gonna go through sort of experiment by experiment to give you the data and the results from what we tested. And the first thing that we tested was starting temperature in the base of the moka pot. If you put cold water in or freshly boiled water in what's the difference? So we ran five simple tests. We started with the base at 20\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C, 80\u00b0C, and freshly boiled water. Relatively easy to do, but we did have a small quirk. Because we were trying to be really consistent I was weighing the water before putting it into the base of the pot, so we always used 200 grams of water every single time to retain some consistency. This meant that the 80\u00b0C water would lose some temperature there, and lose it again going into a cold pot. So even though we heated the water to 80\u00b0C before loading it in for example, it wasn't at 80 degrees Celsius when we started heating it up. The results were I think really, really very interesting. Now I'd been against using cold water in a moka pot because my concern was that you would overheat the coffee inside the brewer as everything heats up. And that's a little bit of a concern, but actually something else really interesting happens. The colder the water in your boiler, the colder the start of your brew temperature. As water heats, and it can be almost any temperature, some of it is evaporating, that happens kind of all the time. The hotter it gets, the more evaporates. And I know that it boils at a hundred degrees Celsius, but you don't need to boil it to have evaporation. That evaporation causes a pressure to build up, and at some point you have enough pressure to push water through coffee. The colder your starting point the colder the temperature at which your coffee starts brewing. If you load this thing with cold water, with 20 degrees Celsius water, then your initial brew temperature, the first water to pass through coffee was about 60 degrees Celsius. Yes, it went up to about 120 degrees Celsius over the course of the brew, but the very start, the earliest extractions you do were much colder. So at 20 in you've got about 60 to start with. And actually the same at 40, it was about 60 to start with. At 60 it went up to about 65. And again at 80 it was about 65, though bear in mind that 80 was not 80 in the pot at the start of heating. By the time we got to freshly boiled water then our brew temperature was around the upper eighties, very early nineties. That's really interesting. And certainly a good idea I think to start with freshly boiled water in the base of the whole thing, because it means you start your brew with a sensible brew temperature. Now one thing I did discover on the brew temperature front is that it actually if you boil the water in the base, and then start to brew that water goes from 100 to 106, 107 very quickly, and you end up with a very hot start to the brew perhaps hotter than I would really want from a taste perspective. So actually having the water in the bottom section be more like 80 to 90 which is what you'd get if you poured from a boiled kettle into a cold base, that seemed to be the better result from my testing. So far, so good. I had a technique out there, I have a technique out there, and it does recommend starting with hot water. So at this point I felt quite good. I felt validated. I thought this is going quite well. I'm hopefully gonna prove that my recommendations were right, maybe learn a thing or two. Very quickly it started to go sideways. Grind size was our next round, and a pretty simple set of experiments, everything run the same way. And we went with a Niche grinder on what would be equivalent of like a 60 setting. I know it only goes to 50 on the numbers. A 50, a 40 and a 30. What I expected to see is as we went finer, and finer, and finer, and got very close to an espresso grind I expected to see a drop in extraction as channeling starts to happen. That did not happen. The finer we went the higher our extractions went, but then there was a twist. We saw something else change quite dramatically, and that was ultimately the brew temperature changed. Now if you think about it this makes sense. If you're building pressure you need to build pressure against something. Water can only exceed 100 degrees Celsius if it's in a pressurized environment. So when you make a moka pot there has to be some resistance there, some pressure to sort of resist against to allow it to reach very, very high temperatures. The finer you ground the coffee, the hotter the brew was able to get. Oh, and the quicker that it heated up as well. So that was kind of interesting, and a little bit unexpected. The very hot brews didn't taste very good, but they were definitely much, much more extracted than the coarser ground brews. Now a quick note on brew temperatures while we're talking about this kind of stuff. If you're starting with freshly boiled water, and you're really building any pressure at all the interesting thing is that you're definitely brewing with water above a hundred degrees Celsius. The interesting thing about it is that it doesn't necessarily taste bad but really, unless you're doing something super super weird, if you've built really any kind of pressure at all even starting with freshly boiled water you are brewing above a hundred degrees Celsius. And you could be anywhere from 101 to about 130\u00b0C being the peak temperature that we recorded doing this whole thing which is too hot. So, yes, above a hundred is okay, but no, really high temperatures are not good and do give that kind of characteristic moka pot harshness that we definitely wanted to avoid. As for the actual heating setup let me talk you through that because well, for reasons you'll see later, really kind of interesting. The original pots that I'd sent to Gabor, I'd sent those particular ones because they were induction friendly. And I thought if I could track the wattage of an induction sort of top I could really track energy in very efficiently. The problem is that they only work on some induction tops, and I do have an induction adapter, but that easily becomes a bit of a problem with a lot of the kind of bench top induction cooking things. So I ended up pulling out an old gas stove thing that I have here, and using the induction plate here as a sort of heat diffusing plate, and also a safe plate to mount a kind of wobbly unbalanced thing on top of a naked flame. So that was the setup that we used for pretty much all of the testing. This is important. We'll come back to it later. The next test was heat power. How much energy, how quickly are we feeding heat into this thing? With a gas burner you can't be super precise so I set it for three different settings. I set high, kind of max flame, medium, and then the lowest flame that I could work with. The results didn't quite go as I expected. The high setting and the medium setting actually both generated a similar pressure, and a similar end temperature, but they kind of got there in a different way that was sort of notable. In fact the high temperature setting performed I think a little bit better. We got more liquid out of the brewer before it started to sputter and kind of overheat, and do the kind of bubbling, hissing awfulness that we will discuss in a little bit. In the medium setting the same thing happened a little bit earlier on that I thought was just really interesting and I don't necessarily understand why, but it definitely did. Now the best performing from pretty much every perspective, the lowest overall brew temperature was the low setting. And so ultimately in all of this I will recommend a low setting for your moka pot brewing. Now what exactly that means is more complicated. I promise we'll come back to it. So let's talk about that kind of sputtering phase that happens at the end of the moka pot brew. Generally that kind of gurgling, angry bubbling that's happening is considered bad. And in all testing I think I can say it is bad. And what I'd recommended previously was that at you immediately stop the brew at that point by running the pot under a cold tap, and that works really well to stop brewing. But I wanted to understand that stage a little bit more. What's seemingly happening is that essentially the whole system is so hot that uncondensed steam is passing right through the puck of coffee all the way into the liquid phase on the other side. And that's bubbling up, and that's pushing liquid up very quickly causing it to kind of spurt and spray out. That phase where uncondensed steam is passing right through the system does correlate with very, very high brew temperatures, and it does correlate to a very unpleasant taste. What I noticed though is that you would get sputtering starting at different moments in the brew depending on a number of different factors. And this is the beginning of me starting to kind of lose it with this brewer. It was really hard to predict early on when a brew would start to sputter. To some extent it correlated to temperature in lower chamber, to some extent to pressure, but not absolutely. What I did know however is that if we're brewing specialty coffee, light roasted coffee, then in that case we need as much brewed liquid as possible ideally through the pot before we start to sputter. If you do any real measurement of coffee brewing you'll know that outside of grind probably the second most important variable is the amount of liquid that you brew coffee with. Now my previous recommendation to stop the brew at the point of sputtering, well, that's actually not that helpful it seems. It doesn't tell you how much liquid you're supposed to produce in that period of time, and it could result in someone stopping a brew very early, and having ultimately quite an under extracted and sour cup. The question I really wanted to answer was, how do we get as much liquid as possible through the pot before we get to that superheated phase? What can we do that is easy as possible to get there? Now it's actually pretty easy to measure the importance of the amount of liquid passing through coffee. Because with this setup what we could do is measure a cumulative extraction. It's a little bit annoying to do, and in this case we took five cupping bowls. You have to weigh the bowl, and we would write the number of bowl, and then the weight of the bowl to 0.1 of a gram on the side of it. And then you capture 20 seconds, or maybe 30 seconds of liquid in each bowl. At that point you can measure the contents of each one, and with a little spreadsheet magic build a kind of cumulative picture of the extraction over time, and over sort of the mass of liquid. And you can see very clearly there is a correlation between the amount of liquid that you pushed through the coffee, and the extraction that you get from it. That is really important. That is unquestionable, and so controlling that was gonna be incredibly important to having a successful brew with this thing here. So it was pretty clear that the next test had to be, when do you cut the heat? Not just when do you cool a pot down, but when do you stop putting heat into the system? And this resulted in discovery of a huge error in testing, but also an interesting piece of learning. Now if you remember the setup was we had the gas burner, the diffusion plate, and the pot on top, and then the tube coming off the side dispensing the liquid onto a scale. What I wanted to do with the first brew was cut the heat, and what I wanted to do also was lift the pot off the diffusion plate. But because I still wanted to capture the liquid into that jug sat on the scale I lifted it maybe two or three centimeters up above the plate. I did not understand the impact of radiant heat from the plate to the pot. The brew though was super interesting. We got a huge amount of liquid out before it started to sputter. If you look at the pressure here you'll see that it doesn't peak particularly high. And it rides very gently, very slowly down. This meant that I think we got about 130, 140 grams of liquid out before the whole pot started to sputter. And previously getting to 120 grams of liquid out, from 200 in the base, was considered pretty successful. The problem was that I immediately realized that I was brewing in a way that I could not easily replicate. I mean I could replicate it if I had a Franken-moka with all of the data on pressure and temperature, but am I telling people that they have to hold their pot just a little bit above the thing as it works? That didn't sit quite right to me. And so I realized that the heating plate is an anomaly compared to most people's set ups. And the heating plate has a really interesting utility to brewing a better moka pot. I don't like this fact, I didn't discover it on purpose. This was an interesting little mistake. Because here's the thing, when you cut the heat completely that pressure will discharge relatively quickly, and you'll go back to kind of nothing. Now you can on again off again, on again off again, and that actually works reasonably well. You might've seen a technique from the Wired Gourmet who does kind of this. He's aiming for a relatively low pressure inside the pot, and kind of adding it to the heat just now and again to boost it back up and go that kind of way. It's an interesting video. You should check it out. I'll leave a link down below. Some of the data we've collected here does disagree with some of the ideas behind what he suggests but I think as a technique it generally does work quite well. The downside for me is this idea of kind of surfing the temperature. Is that necessarily good or easy? Is there an easier way to do this thing? And that's where ultimately this little heating plate came in, and proved to be just super interesting. Firstly it did slow the heating of the pot slightly. You know quite a lot of heat does get through them, but it's slowed it a little bit, and it acted like it was on a very, very low gas setting, and that actually was really quite good. But more interesting than that it kind of acts like a thermal battery, a thermal store. Because you're filling it full of energy as you heat it up, and you're filling the pot full of energy as you heat that up. As you cut the heat the thermal plate is still discharging energy into the pot, and that's really useful. If you cut the heat just right it lets you sort of have enough heat to keep brewing without going on again off again, on again off again. I dislike the idea that it might seem like I'm recommending you buy one more thing for making coffee, but certainly for making moka pots this was an accidental discovery that's proved to be super useful. Now this of course really just applies to gas hobs, and probably induction hobs as well where you're gonna be heating the thing the same way. In an induction hob you might be able to use an induction-friendly pot on it and then instead of using an induction plate like this drop to the lowest setting on your induction hob for the remainder of the brew, I suspect that would work quite well. If you have an electric hob where you have essentially a big element that gets a plate hot on your cooking surface, then that is going to be difficult. Because when you turn that off those tend to store even more heat than something like a diffusion plate. They tend to be bigger, heavier. And so I would move the pot right to the edge of one of those plates just to have the smallest amount of additional heat input that you can. But ultimately those cookers are gonna be the most frustrating to use. With this scenario without a plate you could still use gas and apply low heat, and try and run it on the lowest, smallest, very tiniest flame you possibly can. But, and we'll talk about how to measure this in a little bit, if that doesn't work then getting the best out of the pot may require something like a diffusion plate of some sort. I've only used one and tested one, and perhaps in future I should go and buy a bunch, and see how differently they all act. This one is pretty thick so it'll hold a little bit more heat energy, but this is what I've learned. This is the testing that I've kind of done, and the experiments, and the results that I've had, and I wanted to share that with you as we go. Next up is the AeroPress filter. Now, if you go online and look at moka pot guides a lot of them will recommend using one of these, and they are interesting. So you load your bottom chamber full of freshly boiled water, your coffee on top, and then you turn your top chamber over where the gasket is, and this is sort of mesh basket base almost to sort of strain the coffee, you would place it there so that any liquid going out of the brewer passes through the paper. In testing it did a couple of things that were interesting. It did add a tiny amount of additional resistance like grinding a little bit finer. Which meant that on average brew temperatures were very, very slightly higher. And potentially correlated to that we typically also saw a slight increase in extraction. What I will say that was pretty clear cut is that I did prefer the taste of these brews. They were a little sweeter, a little more complex, just a little bit cleaner, unsurprisingly. With the cost of these being so minimal it seems an easy recommendation to make to have a slightly improved moka pot brew. From the way people talk about it online I did expect a bigger impact on the cup and on extraction which I didn't really see. But, yeah, I'd still recommend adding this in from a taste perspective, from an extraction perspective. However, don't be tempted to use two, or potentially use a thicker filter. I do have from the previous AeroPress testing some of the Aesir filters which are much thicker, and this had a noticeable impact on the brew. It added quite a lot of resistance to the brew as if the coffee was a little bit finer, which meant that we did run notably hotter in the brew process towards the end. So from that perspective I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because you might end up compensating with grind to sort of have a more normal flow, and a better overall performance. And that will drop your extraction, and may not work particularly well if you're working with lighter roasted specialty coffees. Oh and one extra little thing, what we did notice with the AeroPress filter brews is that they were a little bit foamier. Not necessarily in a beautiful way, and I could speculate as to why they might be foamier. It didn't really change the texture, anything like that, that foam dissipated relatively quickly, but don't be surprised if you get a slightly foamier brew from a filter. Now I do briefly wanna talk about bloom. I'd seen this mentioned in a few different recipes, and recommendations online. I didn't have great success here. Now in terms of overall puck prep I would grind the coffee into the basket, settled, both horizontally or vertically, and then prepped with a WDT tool. So a fine needle to stir away any clumps, help with the distribution, tapped a couple of times. I did not fill this thing fully, fully, fully to the brim because I didn't get better results necessarily that way. And the more dose you put in, the harder it's gonna be to get a really good even extraction, especially from lighter roasted coffees. Here there was enough coffee in the basket that it would fill the space comfortably without sort of giving opportunities for channeling, or bypass brewing. However, when it came to blooming, the grind size that I was using did not seem particularly conducive to blooming. I was grinding reasonably fine, not espresso fine, but certainly not filter coarse, and so blooming it was nearly impossible. You know it just didn't absorb very much liquid. It was awkward. And ultimately if I look at my extraction data, and the taste involved I'm not struggling for extraction here. And yes I could grind a little bit coarser, and maybe the bloom would help me out a little bit there to compensate. And maybe if I was trying to run a cooler temperature at the end of the brew, grinding coarser may help a little bit. But certainly with the roasts that I was working with which was sort of light specialty espresso roasts, or sort of light to medium specialty espresso roasts, I didn't really wanna drop the temperature any lower, and I wanted to grind as fine as I could to get the maximum yield. So from my point of view blooming was interesting, but also quite frustrating. Now, as a quick aside, I was thinking at one point 'cause I spent a lot of time thinking about this stuff, how could you prevent the brew exceeding a hundred degrees Celsius, but still have enough pressure to brew? Is that even possible? And I did come up with one way, and that is to boil your moka pot. Because what happens there is that essentially you will heat the water in the base to pretty much a hundred degrees Celsius. It will reach reasonable pressure cause there's a decent amount of evaporation happening right below boiling point, and that's what we saw. The brew temperatures were always in the mid nineties, the flow is nice and steady, and well it was really pretty slow, but we never exceeded a hundred degrees Celcius at any point in the brew. But the brew did take 10 minutes because peak pressure was 0.12 bars. Now that's enough to brew with even with a relatively fine grind. You don't need much pressure to get water through coffee, but it really made for a very, very, very slow brew. And even though the contact time was really very long, the extraction was notably lower, and the cup not particularly delicious. So the good news is I'm not gonna recommend that you boil your moka pots to make delicious coffee, but you should know that we tried it, and it was kind of fun. Aluminum versus stainless. Is one better? We talked about the stigma around aluminum in the previous episode, there are no health concerns with aluminum, but is it an inferior metal for heating or brewing a moka pot with? There was really only one way to find out. What we need is thermal imaging, what we need is predator vision. So to achieve this we did what anyone normal would do which is rent an incredibly expensive thermal imaging camera to look at the difference in the metals as they heat up. But quickly we realized there was a problem. I should have remembered this, reflective materials are really hard to read on thermal imaging cameras. They basically just reflect the IR from the room, so you can't tell how hot they are. So we did what anyone sensible would do which is go and buy some heat proof spray paint. And spray paint a little patch on each pot so that we could see just how hot they were gonna get on that one particular strip. And we filmed them being heated from cold to hot. This is just fascinating. Aluminum is more thermally conductive than stainless steel. So I thought the upper chamber of the aluminum pot would get hotter quicker. But what we see is the stainless steel pot gets hotter quicker. And I don't really understand that, though it might be the aluminum is a better heat sink, it's distributing the heat more evenly. But you can see on the stainless steel pot there's that isolated pocket of warmth at the base of the upper chamber, and I don't really understand that. So now you can see the base of the aluminum is getting hotter, and the upper chamber is now starting to get pretty hot too. We're still below boiling point on these pots. And then the aluminum gets hotter, and hotter, and hotter, almost seems to overtake the stainless steel pot. I don't even understand what I'm seeing. But what I do love to see is when they start to brew you can see it in the stainless steel pot, but you can't see it in the aluminum pot. Because if you watch you'll see that green level start to rise up and that's cooler liquid. So clearly the liquid in the aluminum pot is hotter than the liquid in the stainless steel pot. And I presume the brew temperature is the same way too. And if you look at both bases at this point the aluminum base is much, much, much, much, much hotter than the stainless steel base even though the heat was running on the stainless steel base for longer. Maybe the stainless steel almost insulates the water from an aggressive flame. My gut is: stainless steel is better. There's not a massive difference in these two brewers in terms of mass, they both hold the same amount of water and coffee. These are 30 to 300s ish. This one weighs 600 grams, this one weighs 700, but it is a bit more thermal mass especially in the lower chamber. So that's gonna change the way that the sort of water inside it is heated once you take away the heat from the flame. So back to the heating plate, and back to the last of the experiments that we did trying to get somewhere with better brewing. What we were trying to do ultimately was use the heating plate as that little thermal battery, and the best results we had were starting with a cold plate. Because if you started with a hot plate already, and brewed back to back, it brewed differently. And this is, just as an aside, this is this brewer. You don't need to change almost anything. A tiny change will manifest very obviously in the temperature, in the pressure, in the point at which it starts to splutter, and get steamy and annoying. It's really fussy. Millions of people would tell you it's easy. You just put coffee in, put water in, you screw it together, put it on the hob, coffee comes out, you take it off, you drink the coffee. It's easy. Anyone can do it. Millions of people do it. But ignorance is maybe bliss. This is such a fussy little thing, a frustrating thing, and I think I'll be resentful for years to come. Back on topic. What we were aiming for was to get at least 60% of the water that we put into the base through the coffee before we hit the steamy angry phase. That will give you a ratio of about six to one in these particular situations, and that's really useful. That to me is pure flexibility. With lighter roasts you need more liquid. With dark roasts you'll get away with less, and you can stop a darker roast earlier, certainly well before it gets too hot, and have a good tasting extraction. I can't give you the exact numbers that are right for every coffee, that's just not how it works, but this is just useful information to be armed with when trying to get the best out of a brewer. In our testing, generally speaking, freshly boiled water into the base, filter paper in there as well, screwed together, heat it up until liquid starts to flow, and typically that happened at about .3 bars inside the brewer. At that point we've cut the heat, and the residual heat of the heating plate would continue to add some heat and pressure. We might peak at about .6 of a bar, but it meant that we would typically get to about 120 to 125 grams out before we hit the sputtering stage. And if we looked at the extractions they were very healthy at that point, often above 23, 23 and a half percent. Really quite strong as well which we'll touch on in just a second, but very well extracted, very tasty, not super hot, not overly harsh, none of the moka pot taste, and really quite good. Now as I said, all the testing was done on the Franken-mokas which are 20 to 200 style brewers. The 30 to 300 worked really well. I would suspect the pressure would have peaked a little bit lower 'cause there was just that bit more water to heat with the energy inside the diffusion plate. But with smaller brewers I think you'd have a bit of trouble there, and you might wanna leave it on the plate for another 10 seconds and then remove it at that point. Because it's probably enough temperature and pressure inside there to get the last of that liquid through. But if you left it on the plate the whole time I think it would rocket up to higher pressures and temperatures, and you'd get the angry, steamy spluttering. Again testing the amount of liquid that you get out is a pretty good piece of feedback on your technique. Did this go well? Do I have at least 60% out? If you're doing that, if that's kind of how it's happening that should still taste good, and you can certainly play around with it lower than that if you want a stronger beverage, but you know what you're getting out at that point. And like I said I was hitting very high extractions, cutting it shorter, with darker roasts I think would allow you to have something that would go into milk really well, and dilute well. And actually, a note on dilution: The brews that I was getting out of this even at a six to one ratio were really very strong. They were 3 to 4%, really depending on a number of variables, but often three and a half to 4%. In those situations drinking them was still intense, often from the perspective of acidity which lighter roast tend to have a lot of. Diluting them down with a little hot water kinda making a little moka pot Americano really, really improved the flavor. The acidity became extremely balanced. The sweetness remained pleasant and extremely present, and they were just lovely to drink. That would have been down to say a 1.5 to 2% strength drink so still more texture, still more strength than say a filter coffee, but lovely, lovely balance, really great flavors, great clarity, just very enjoyable. If you brew a brew that is good but just a little bit sour still, just a little bit dominant in acidity just try adding some water to lengthen it down, and just be amazed at the way that it just balances everything out. For exact numbers: a 120 gram brew I would often add anywhere from 80 to 100 grams of freshly boiled water just to lengthen it out and dilute it down. Obviously this is entirely about preference, so you do you. So it's time to wrap up the experiments that we've gone through, and what we might've learned, and what it means going forward into what might be the next video in the series. Firstly though if you wanna win a Franken-moka don't forget there's a raffle, link in the description down below. $3 or more as a donation will enter you into that raffle, and you could win one of these. I'll throw in some coffee, maybe some other random stuff just to be nice. So please enter if you can, support a great organization. Back to the wrap-up. I hoped that I would potentially prove that my previous recommendations were good. I'm only human, of course that's what I wanted.", "videoID": "zK0F5PqJ1Gk"}, {"title": "First Look Review\uff1a Cafelat Robot", "text": "Today we're going to look at the Cafelat Robot, a little manual lever espresso machine. A lot of you have asked for this review, so here it is, and this is kind of a first look review. I'm gonna pour some shots, get a feel for it, let you know what I'm thinking. Now this review, like all my reviews is powered by Patreon. Thank you to all of you who give me a budget to go out and buy these things, not owe anyone anything, I can be honest, I can tell you the truth about how I feel, and I'm gonna give this away to a Patreon backer afterwards. This is, I think, the Barista Model, so it has a little pressure gauge on it. It is a $370 manual espresso machine, and it looks cool. I think this thing looks really really good. This is in the green, they do do a kind of silver version, but green all the way for me. Now, when you buy this thing you get a few more things in the box, and talking you through them, it's gonna be a nice little explainer about how this whole thing works cause it's a little bit different to some of the other manual espresso machines out there. Most of the magic is gonna happen in this thing here, this is your portafilter basket, slash portafilter itself, slash brew chamber, slash dispersion screen. I will explain, so inside here there's kind of three pieces. You've got this, which is just a holder, this is what you're gonna use to lock in the basket into the machine, and this, this is your basket, and it's just like a kind of regular double basket that you would get from espresso machine, except the walls are really long because it's also gonna act as kind of your brew chamber. So you're gonna put coffee in here like you would any other espresso machine basket, you're gonna tamp it down, and then this goes on top, which is kind of a dispersion screen, so it sits on top of the coffee. Now, what's gonna surprise people is that you then put your hot water straight off the boil into this basket. Drop it in there, you lock it in to the machine, you're gonna use these to just drive the water through the coffee to create a delicious espresso, and this one does have a pressure gauge, so you can see how much pressure you're applying in real time, which is kind of nice. That's most of what you get, you get a tamper that fits, interesting little design. It does also come with spouts, and this is a kind of a cool little choice. So easiest way to explain this, these just gasket on to the bottom of that. Now, I would say, nine and a half times out of 10 people using this thing aren't gonna use this, they're gonna wanna see that kind of naked extraction. And I would also add, there are a couple of downsides to using the sort of splitter that I'll talk about a little bit later on. My unit did also come with a pressurized portafilter, so here it look like a regular espresso machine basket there, but there's kind of one tiny hole, and the idea behind this is that you add a lot of pressure through this sort of restriction point here that your coffee isn't providing cause it's that sort of medium grind stuff in supermarkets that can't make espresso that's labeled for espresso. Who knows what they're thinking? But that's kind of what this is for, so if you want to use pre-ground coffee and get some decent results, then pressurized portafilters are pretty good for that, but if you've got a good grinder, no, no, no, that's not what we need, we want the proper basket. Let's make some coffee. Let's make some coffee. That's what we're here to do. I'm gonna talk you through how I've been making coffee and hopefully answer a few questions you might have along the way, and I'll kind of nitpick a few little things and talk about things that I really like as well. The basket can go from, I think, about 10 grams all the way up to 20, though at 20 it's gonna be pretty physical. I have been brewing, so far, about 17 grams, so let me just weigh that out. 17.1 should be fine. Now this nearly, nearly fits perfectly on the Niche dosing cup, but not quite. It's not a bad thing though, it works well enough. Immediately, you're probably thinking about thermal management. In reviews of other manual espresso makers, I've talked a lot about the challenges of thermal management with these kind of things. This basket's pretty much cold, and that's okay because essentially the liquid when it brews is really just gonna pass through the bottom of the basket and go straight to the cup, so not a huge thermal loss there. Again, once we've tamped this... Just a slightly weird, but not unpleasant experience, and we put the basket on top. We're gonna put pretty much just off boiling water on top of this, that's rapidly gonna heat the basket it doesn't weigh that much, it'll pull just a little temperature off the very, very hot water and we should then be brewing in a pretty sweet spot in terms of espresso brewing temperatures. Now, there's a couple of ways you could approach how much water to put in. You could put in more than you need and just stop your shot early. The challenge with that is that I've yet to find a set of scales that neatly fits under here. I've got a cheap brand, like I said, off of Amazon that's a bit too wide. The Acaia Lunar espresso scales are a little bit too wide, so that's harder for me to know exactly when to stop the shot. With a little bit of trail and error, you can kind of work out how much you want out plus how much you might lose to the coffee itself, and then just put in as much as you need. I've generally been chasing 17 grams in about 38 grams out, a slightly longer ratio than two to one, and to do that, I've been putting in about 58 to 60 grams. Most makes it through, but the coffee itself does absorb some, not as much as it would do in say a filter coffee because most of the water is being squeezed out of those grounds, so they absorb a bit more than a gram per gram, but not a lot more, not two grams per gram anyway. About 60 grams in works really well for me to get 38 grams out with a 17 gram dose. Let's pour some water. So this is just off the boil, I'm gonna add about 60 grams there. This isn't hot yet, and then there's a slightly unusual feeling when you actually lock it in because it feels kind of loose, but once you apply pressure, you should be okay. I'm gonna pull this into the new Cru espresso glass. All right, espresso time. So I'm around nine bars there, working hard. I should have my espresso, if I take away the pressure, it should stop dripping. There we go, got myself a little double espresso. It smells pretty good, and I have to say, tastes pretty good. I've had some really, really nice shots from this thing. That is, I mean, that is a good shot. That is sweet, it's well extracted, I think it definitely benefits from a little bit more length. I just find coffee easier to brew at a slightly more than two to one, especially in these type of setups. The Niche is a grinder that tends to give you a little bit more texture than it does clarity, and in this kind of a setup, I think that works really well. A lot of what people like about levers is having a lot of control and also quite textural shots that you get from them. That was good. A little bit messy, but I'm okay. I could have dealt with that before drinking my coffee, but I'm always in a hurry. The cleanup's okay. You would all wipe off the piston at the bottom here, but very little coffee really comes in contact with it cause the shower screen is in the way. Your shower screen really needs to go to the sink, right. There's no simpler way to wash that, so put it in a sink, give it a wash, it's very simple, very easy, and then you got your basket. Now, the top is still okay to hold temperature wise, so you can tap it out, taps out reasonably clean. Again, generally speaking, the more compressed your puck is at the end of that shot, the easier it will be to tap it all out. If you're kind of declining your pressure through the shot, which is totally a thing people do and enjoy, you might have a slightly looser puck, but that's fine. You can wipe the rest of it out with a towel or give it a rinse in the sink if you want to. If you're gonna brew straight away, I'd probably clean it out with a towel and just go again, but if I'm not gonna use it till tomorrow, to the sink, and that's kind of it, that's the bits to clean. Obviously, the base of it gets messy, needs a wipe, but that's it. I have to say, it's just nice to use. The workflow seems a little funny to watch, right, the pouring the water in then getting the hot water into the machine. The first few times, you do feel a little conscious of that. The more I use it, the less I thin about that, actually. I did say I would mention the spouts again. These are lovely, well-made, but they're very heavy, and because of that, they have a large thermal mass, which means if they're not very, very, very hot, they will pull heat from your espresso liquid. That means that your shots will brew at a nice temperature, but be cooled on their way to the cup, so you can preheat this. you could leave it in some boiling water and just kind of clip the brew chamber on top of it to sort of create that seal and pick it up and drain it out. It's a little bit fussy. Most people would wanna see a naked extraction or just are gonna drink the double out of it. There's no huge use for them. It's nice that it comes with it, but just be aware that it will mean a little bit more work. The other sort of small frustrations that I've had with it to date, the brewing gauge is not always the easiest to see, it depends how you're using it. I know I'm a littler taller, but getting a good angle to sort of be able to push down and look isn't the easiest. It's not the worst either, I've certainly been able to see what pressure I'm brewing at. It's interesting to feel that pressure in a different way. I'm not saying it's harder, the Flair is a little different, for example. This, you've got two points of pressure, these are a nice length, you're certainly able to exert high pressures with it, but I did feel like I was doing some work to hit my nine bars, I really did. Don't put it in the dishwasher. I don't know if I need to tell you that, but don't. It's really easy to clean. I wish this was a bit wider or I wish it was easier to get a scale underneath, be it having the legs wider or just finding a scale that fits. I would like to have the ability to stop a shot based on liquid in the cup cause that's just how I think about espresso, that's the easiest way to nail your shot time after time after time. I think it's beautiful, I think it's a really well-made solid feeling thing. I think it's absolutely worth the money. I really enjoy using this, actually. Maybe I'm slowly becoming a kind of manual espresso person, you know, I enjoyed using things like the Flair and the ROK and this. This I think is excellent, I really do. I've really enjoyed the shots, the workflow did freak me out initially, but, actually, it's not too bad at all. There's moments when I kind of wish that the little handle piece didn't sit as close to the lever as it does, that's not the end of the world though. Overall, I'm impressed, as a first look, I'm impressed. I would enjoy having this in my life. I really enjoyed the coffee I've gotten from it, I don't worry too much about thermal management with it, which is kind of interesting compared to some other brewers. Yeah, well done Cafelat. From my point of view, that is a nice little brewer. So if you're a long time subscriber or even a short time subscriber, you might notice that this is a different sort of place for me to stand and review than usual.", "videoID": "11ZSXVZbQbA"}, {"title": "Coffee Recipe Water Compared", "text": "I think a fun one today. A nice little comparison review because there's been more of these kinda products popping up. And I just wanna know myself, how they compare, how they differ. Now, if you're not familiar with what you're seeing, here's the deal, these four products are from four different companies and they're aiming to solve the problem of which water should I brew my coffee with? Because we know, the water you brew with has a big impact and often fixing that can be difficult, frustrating. The idea here is that they sell the perfect ratio of minerals that you then add to distilled pure water and then you've got the end of it, perfect water for coffee. And I know I say perfect 'cause there's no such thing but I also say perfect 'cause everyone here kind of seems to be talking about perfect to some extent. Let's get into what we've got on the table. Now, the first up is a Third Wave Water. I would say probably the pioneers in this space, correct me if I'm wrong. Now, as disclosure, Third Wave Water have supported the world's largest coffee tasting twice with free product that we've then passed on. It's meant that anyone taking part in a tasting around the world can be using exactly the same water and therefore having as close to the same experience as possible. Now, this is their classic profile, and this is I think shipped just for Europe because the sizing is different. These are little sachets, and this goes into two liters. It's a metric dosage, for which I'm very grateful 'cause in the UK and in Europe, we don't have access to gallons of water. Literally we can't buy a gallon of water in a shop very easily, if at all. It's all metric. So you buy like five liters or one liter, but not a gallon. So this is for two liters, which I do quite like. Now, Third Wave Water do other profiles too. They do espresso profile, and a dark roast profile. This is the classic and so that's what we're gonna be testing today. Next up is a different approach. This is GC Water. This is their perfect cup formula. Wait, did ThirdWave say perfect anywhere? No use of the word perfect. We'll decide if that's a bonus or not later. Now this is a different approach, which is interesting. This is not a powder like the Third Wave Water. This is two little droppers of liquid. So the idea here is you put one milliliter of each one and the metric usage is noted there, of A and B into a gallon of water, and then you've got a perfect combination of minerals. I will say from a usability perspective, the little droppers on here have been a bit annoying. This was quite easy to just tear up and pour the sachet in. Here, you can see on here, there's little markings for sort of how much liquid you should be sort of using, and you can see there's a one milliliter line there. The frustrating thing is you can't squeeze enough air out of the dropper. If I squeeze everything out, really to get more than 0.75. So that's just not a very well chosen dropper from my perspective. I did a 0.75 and then a 0.25, which was just awkward. Just let me get a milliliter. And then here, we've got coffee, brewing water from Aquacode, no use of the word perfect, which is good as far as I can tell. So these work in metric, which I do appreciate, but they're for seven liters, right? It's a six mil sachet for seven liters of water. And I don't know why it's seven liters. That's such an odd size. I can buy five, I can buy one, but why seven? So mixing this was a little bit difficult. In the end I weighed the contents of a sachet and then very carefully took half of it out and put into three and a half liters of water just 'cause that's much more practical to me than trying to do seven when I don't have a seven liter container and I've never seen a seven liter container. Anyway, and then on the end here, perfect coffee water. Now there's a lot of innovation around the names here. We've got coffee brewing water, we've got perfect coffee water, we've got perfect cup water, and then Third Wave Water. So points, I suppose to ThirdWave for standing out at that front. These are sachets again, and each sachet here does one gallon of water, frustratingly but I can work with a gallon. They do a version that does five gallons, if you've got one of those giant sort of things. I guess you can buy five gallon tanks in the US maybe I guess? But a one gallon is what we used here. So that was kinda nice. These are your options, but how are they different? Because none of them really give up their secret sauce, right? None of them will tell you what their composition is perhaps because making your own water is quite easy. If you're willing to source deionized water and do all of that, then actually to do a home brewed version is relatively easy. But if you don't wanna do that, these are the options that are out there. So instead of doing testing or that kinda stuff, what I thought would be more interesting is to do a taste comparison. So here's how it's gonna work. I've got three different roasts here. I've got a light roast, a medium roast and a dark roast. What we did here is we used a zero water filter, right? Which actually strips everything out of your water back to pretty much zero. I just find that easier than going and buying a ton of deionized water and cheaper too. So brand new filter in there stripped back to zero and all of these were then made up. These have since been randomized or turned blind for me. So they've got into like an ABCD situation, so I don't know which of the waters is which now. What'll happen is that for each of the roasts, we're gonna brew with each of the waters. So there's gonna be three groups of tasting, a light, and medium, and a dark, and then randomized within those will be all of these waters, and we'll see how each of them performs at different roast levels. Now we're gonna be using the cupping method a straight infusion brew. I figured that's the easiest way to remove as many variables as possible and just taste the water coffee interaction. So as you can see, we're kinda brewing in batches here. So when it is time for tasting C and D will be marginally hotter, there's about four minutes gap between their brewing times which as they cool down, won't really matter that much. But I don't know which is C, which is D, I don't know which is A which is B in those kinda group tasting. So, I will be as blind as blind can be and what I'm looking for, are kind of trends across the different roast levels, right? If the same water performs in a very similar way, it affects acidity in a very similar way, or affects sort of bitterness in a very similar way, that's sort of notable. And what I hope to do, with this tasting is give you advice about, with the preference that you have for roast or coffee flavor, which water might be the water for you if you're looking for one of these as a solution to coffee brewing water at home. Time, I think pretty much to break and clean these ones, and then we'll do a little redistribution and make life as difficult as possible for me, So I don't know what's going on. So I'm just gonna taste my way through this. I'm going to start with a light roast grouping first, a medium, dark. There'll be a slurp, but let's not just have a lot of slurps that might get a little bit too much. So, here's your first one. On we go. First impressions tasting this group, what's defining the differences is acidity. That's kind of interesting. The differences don't feel quite as profound in the medium roast group, so I'm kind of interested to see how the dark roast group will be. I can't tell the difference between these ones. It's really hard down this end to pick them apart. I think it's time for some results. I will talk through my preferences. I'm not gonna say these ones are best, it'll be interesting to see how different ones perform at different stages. So I've pushed forward the furthest the one I liked the most, so in this case, this was the one I liked the best, then this one, and then these two. Sort of an equal third place. And same again here, I like this one best then this one and these two equal third place. It's interesting that the pattern matches, so it's highly unlikely that this is the same winner across both. On the dark roast, it was really, really hard to pick them apart. And this one was slightly less bitter, very slightly sweeter but really astonishing to me actually how similar they were in the cup. All potentially have broken my palate walls at this point. Another option, and it's really hard, I think in the tasting to jump between roasts because a big part of your tasting experience is contrast. So when you go from say, a medium roast to a dark, that first dark taste that you get it seems darker than it is, right? It seems more intensely bitter, much harsher compared to this, but as you compare to more similar bowls, the tasting gets closer in a funny way. Let me just lock in my preference. This bowl here, it just had a bit more balance of acid and sweet and then it became increasingly sort of acid dominant. So here, a little zingier, zippier they both have really nice fruit from the coffee present. Then these two, again, just a bit zippier still just a good amount of zing if you like fresh, crisp acidity in your coffees then I think it would really like this. I like more of a sweet acid balance, and so this one stood out for me as being just very enjoyable. Similarly, here, it's a little jump up in acid from this to this. This is again, a bit more sweeter, a bit more balanced for this roast level. And then these two, this one's a little flatter generally. And this one is kind of just a bit tangier, I'm not saying I would prefer one over the other. They are quite different there, which is interesting. And then this one was just not quite as bad as the others. Now, before we do the reveal, there's a little something first which is a short ad for this video's sponsor.

Time for the reveal and it's gonna be like a weird double reveal because I don't know what the letters are yet. So we'll kind of see if any one letter does better and then we'll find out what that letter is. So, from the light roast, letter C did the best for me, followed by letter B. Now in this one, it's a win for B. so B is doing quite well a first and a second. And this one, oh, this one's A, interesting. This was C, now that's interesting. Now this felt a little flat in a medium roast but it felt a bit more balanced in a light roast. I really can't wait to see what these are. And this one that fell a bit tangier was D. Now on this side, D takes a win! This is really interesting. Okay, it's kinda good news actually. So D for me stood out as being a bit more interesting, balanced, less bitter. So now I guess we should find out what's what. Now I gather, that they are written on the bottom of the packets, so let's find out. Perfect coffee water, first one I picked up was B. Now I think B had the win over here, right? So yes. So I would say this tasted really good with kind of a medium roast, very nice. C, takes a win over here. C, so C, this did really well on this sort of light roast end of things. Third Wave Water were A. You, no, you came second over here. So again, very nice in the sort of medium roast category which means that this is D. It is D, which is interesting that it did well in that sort of darker roast section. Definitely an interesting selection.", "videoID": "g-5p_H9WNpA"}, {"title": "James & James\uff1a Five Elixirs", "text": "\u266a But it really doesn't matter with me now \u266a \u266a Because I've been to the mountain top \u266a \u266a Yeah \u266a   - Gilly is a brew bar based in Stone Mountain, Georgia which is the home of the rebirth of the KKK. Gilly serves in that tension. What makes Gilly unique are the elixirs and elixirs are inspired from my Caribbean background. They are homemade concoctions that include bitters, natural herbs that are then brewed together to create medicines that cure sickness. The same concept has been embedded into our DNA. We use coffee and tea-based elixirs as a vehicle for storytelling. Every season we drop five new beverages, that tell a story, that are important to us and our community. In this video, we will take you into how we create these elixirs, the story telling of them and how you can make them at home. These are all new elixirs that we have released at our bar this winter season. - Black history is important to us as a black-owned business. We honor the triumphs and struggles of African-Americans throughout US history and today. This season we hope to honor the writers. James Baldwin is our inspiration for this season. James Baldwin was a writer who gave language and literature to the cry for justice and the civil rights movement, a cry that is still happening today. Baldwin often used scripture, which was an early influence, to convey certain points he sought to make. In the spirit of honoring that, we use scripture to also influence our creation of drinks. Both James Baldwin and the book of James had strong words, one to America and one to the church. The book of James is a calling out of sorts, to live what you say you believe. This season we are penning words that remind us to live what we believe. Each elixir will be called a chapter in honor of who James Baldwin was as a writer and in conjunction with a number of books in the book of James. When we were thinking about Baldwin, we thought about what influenced him, Harlem, music, scripture his unique style, his drinks of choice, and what he conveyed We wanted our ingredients to communicate a bittersweet feel for the truth spoken from James and James. Elixir Chapter One This elixir is based off of James chapter one. We use silver needle tea as a base to represent the silversmith testing of silver by fire. The flavor that you experience in tea best comes out under heat; Baldwin's writings were produced and perfected under intense pressure. We also use fish bouillon to represent the testing and temptation of life, also seen in James chapter one. The tea we use is silver needle tea that we got from Just Add Honey, but you can find this at any of your local grocery stores. You take one gram of the tea and add two ounces of water at 165 degrees Fahrenheit. For the broth, you take a quarter of a cube of fish bouillon, you can again find this at any of your local grocery stores. You add half a cup of water and 25 grams of demerara. Add a full sprig of sage and bring everything to a boil. Once it comes to a boil, you take it off the heat and let it cool. - Elixir Chapter Two James Baldwin's style and swagger influenced this drink. There's something magical about brewing coffee in the morning. James' morning ritual may have included a cup of coffee or tea, but most definitely a morning cigarette. To make this elixir, we recommend you smoke the glass. In the past we've smoked herbs or spices, but in this case we're going to use coffee to add a nice deep toasty aroma. The brewing method is an Aeropress and we use a double filter, so don't forget to pre-wet. The coffee we use is from Black &amp; White coffee roasters. It's a Colombian coffee and we use 24 grams with 130 grams of water. We brew that at boiling point, 212 degrees Fahrenheit. You let the water sit for two minutes, then you slowly press. Then we add a black jam. This particular one is a black sugar ginger tea , can bring that to a boil stir it down, let it cool. All of these ingredients you can find at a local farmer's market near you. - Elixir Chapter Three This elixir is inspired by a quote from James Baldwin that goes \"God gave Noah the rainbow sign, No more water, fire next time\" The Fire Next Time is also a book written by Baldwin. James chapter three also speaks on the tongue being a fire capable of setting a forest ablaze, just as Baldwin did. There are two main components to this drink, cold brew and the jam. For the cold brew we use our Gilly blend which has bright, buttery brown sugar notes. You can feel free to use whatever cold brew you would like from your local coffee shop and/or make your own. We like to use a one-to-one ratio, of one pound of coffee to one gallon of water. We let it steep overnight for 24 hours. To make the chili pepper pomegranate jam, we use peppers and half a pomegranate. So you take five peppers, you can feel free to cut them up, and you would cut this pomegranate in half and scoop out the pomegranate seeds into a pot. You would then add four cups of cane sugar and one cup of pomegranate juice. You would let that simmer to a boil and it should look like this when it is done. \u266a That we as a people will get to the promised land \u266a \u266a Go ahead \u266a  \u266a Go ahead \u266a \u266a Go ahead \u266a - Elixir Chapter Four There is a quote by James Baldwin that says \"to be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious, is to be in a rage almost all the time\". We use the Boulevardier bourbon Negroni cocktail as an inspiration for this beverage. In a shaker, we add cold-brew coffee. It's a nitrogen infused cold-brew, four ounces. We then add a non-alcoholic Campari, which is composed of three dashes of orange bitters, 0.5 ounce of maraschino syrup, 0.25 ounce of pomegranate juice, and a sprig of tarragon. We also created an in-house vermouth which is composed of coriander simple syrup, (we steeped a one-to-one ratio of cane sugar and water with the coriander seed) then we add 0.5 ounce of white wine vinegar, last but not least is our homemade jam which is made up of a whole grapefruit. We add the juice and the pulp, one cup of sugar, and three ounces of maple syrup. You want to bring it all to a boil and let it simmer until it comes to a jam consistency. - Elixir Chapter Five This drink is inspired by James chapter five which speaks on being patient in suffering just as a farmer waits for the rain. We use alkaline water to symbolize the patience of a farmer who waits for rain. With this drink, we honor the heroes of the civil rights movement and the heroes of today. They remain resilient and faithful to the mission, even while enduring great suffering. They endure with patience to see the rains of justice. The main components of this drink are matcha, simple syrup, and a tonic syrup. For the matcha, we use a culinary matcha from Mizuba. We steep the matcha in alkaline water. So you take two ounces of alkaline water, which you can get from any local grocery store, and three grams of the matcha. We then add 1.5 ounces of star anise simple syrup. We make the simple syrup with a one-to-one ratio: so one cup of cane sugar to one cup of alkaline water.", "videoID": "hdCZqYD-tBw"}, {"title": "The Ultimate Espresso Affogato", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about espresso affogato. That is, ice cream with a shot of espresso poured on top. Cos I have some issues with espresso affogato. But I'm gonna fix those issues. Well, one of them anyway. Because, I kind of have a beef with the name. The espresso isn't drowning, the ice cream is drowning. Why is it not? gelato affogato? That's beside the point. The real problem I have with espresso affogato, is that it's disappointing. I'm not saying it's not good. I'm not saying you haven't enjoyed them, but, typically, they are less than the sum of that part. I love ice cream. I love the espresso, but together, it's often a little bit,. So this led me to a journey into ice cream. I wanted to understand why it wasn't good and how then to make the ultimate espresso affogato. The first thing I needed to do was make a lot of ice cream. So, I hit up the lovely people at Sage, and asked to borrow an ice cream machine and they very kindly sent me one over. So thank you to them. They're not sponsoring. They just lent me this and sadly I have to give it back. And I decided to answer some flavor questions. First, I wanted to really answer two separate questions. Is vanilla good or bad? And then eggs. Cos eggs are a tricky thing. Right? If you've had brunch and you had like a nice poached egg and you cut into it, and you're eating that egg, and then you drink some coffee, you'll notice your coffee tastes kind of weird. Eggs definitely mess with the taste of coffee. But eggs are really common in ice cream. They do wonders to kind of improve its texture as well as its flavor in many cases. So, I wanted to assess were eggs good or bad. So to achieve this, I made three different ice creams. I made a milk ice cream, A Fior di latte. I made an egg free vanilla ice cream, and then I made a frozen custard. Something super heavy on the egg yolks. So for the fior di latte, I turned to Stella Parks aka Brave Tart because she's just a go tooth anything sweet online and this was a pretty simple milk forward recipe. 35 grams of cornstarch, 265 grams of sugar, two and a half grams of salt, 225 grams of heavy or double cream. 565 grams of milk. Now, the idea is pretty simple. You're gonna take a portion of that cream, and whisk it with the sugar and the cornstarch together to create a sort of thick and hydrated cornstarch. You have to heat the milk pretty high to do that, which means that you would destroy some of the flavor of that milk. Which is why you only heat a portion and then you add back in, fresh cream, fresh milk, before you then jam. The egg free vanilla ice cream I took from my friend at Shift steps. Because they always do a great job with super precise recipes. - I love ice cream. - Point 4 grams of locust bean gum, point four grams of xanthan gum, point one grams of carrageenan, we took 120 grams of sugar, 50 grams of skimmed milk powder, 450 grams of milk, 165 grams of heavy cream, and eight grams of vanilla bean pulp which is a lot. The technique here is pretty simple. You combine your dry ingredients together, you whisk it into your liquid ingredients. This you then, back up and cook sous vide at 95 degrees celsius for 30 minutes. After cooking, blend it with some vanilla beans, and then you chill it down in an ice bath, before you then turn it into ice cream. The frozen custard again came from ChefSteps. It's a super simple recipe. 225 grams of sugar, 650 grams of milk, 200 grams of egg yolks, 150 grams of heavy or double cream, 45 grams of skimmed milk powder, five grams of salt, 10 grams of vanilla extract, here you just mix it all together, and then you cook it sous vide at one of two temperatures. I just cook it a little bit lower, 65 sous for an hour, because I was more concerned about taste, than I was about texture at this point. Then you chill it down, churn it into ice cream. And so we had three different ice creams. And this is really good place to be in your life. We then did a taste comparison. We took members of the team at Square Mile, and we gave them affogatos, and we asked them to say, which of those three they preferred the taste of? This wasn't about texture. It wasn't about sweetness. This was about flavor. Which ice cream worked the best with the coffee? Now the results of this were super interesting, and it did confirm some suspicions I had held. In last place was the frozen custard. It turns out that eggs do indeed mess a little bit with the taste of the coffee. It's hard to describe, but it definitely mutes or blunt aspects of the espressos taste in a way that no one really liked. Now, when it came to, the other two these were both popular. One was popular for having a lovely clean milk taste but was a little bland. And as it got a little bit closer to melting that cornstarch, gave it a kind of gummy texture. Now the shift that's ice cream was really good but again, not without some issues. Eight grams of vanilla bean pulp is not only wildly expensive to do, but it's actually just way too much vanilla taste. In addition, the fact that all of the dairy had been held at a high temperature, gave it that kind of cooked milk taste that I don't really like. No one should really like especially if you spent time being a barista, and a kind of allergic to the smell of overheated milk. What I did like about it, was the texture was good, the sweetness was nearly there, it was close. So it left me feeling that there had to be a kind of hybrid way I wanted that kind of milk flavor from the fior di latte. And I wanted some vanilla but less. You wanna feel like you're eating ice cream, and vanilla just triggers that part of your brain that says, \"I'm eating delicious ice cream\". So I kind of created a hybrid version of the recipe. I used the thickening agents from the Chef Dave's Recipe, but I took the technique from Stella. So, I took a portion of the milk and the cream, and I heated it up with the sugar and the gums joining agents. You want to take it up to the point, where it's just about boiling and hold it there, until you see it thicken and you'll see a textural change. And then I would cool that down, whip in the milk powder, that's quite hard work to get it to dissolve but I didn't wanna cook it, and then the fresh milk and cream. And then I added the vanilla. I added a small amount of pulp about one vanilla beans worth, it's about a gram, and then about five grams of vanilla bean paste. Now when you turn this all up, you end up with an ice cream that goes so well with espresso. But it didn't mean we were done with testing. So if you want the full ice cream recipe with all the measurements and the step by steps, well, I created a page on my website, a website that I built, thanks to the sponsor of today's video, which is Squarespace.

Thanks to them for sponsoring this video. Let's get back to the ice cream. One other things we wanted to test was the right ratio between ice cream and espresso. Now, this is presuming you're doing a smart thing, which is making sure that your cups are freezing cold. Essential to make this all work. And then testing about 50 grams of ice cream worked really beautifully with a single shot of espresso. There was one more thing that I really wanted to look at though. When you add your espresso. Should that espresso be hot? Or should it be cooled, chilled, cold? We run some tests. It turns out that the best result come from pulling a shot, hot onto the ice cream directly. Now, the ice cream and the cup itself chill out espresso very quickly. But there is just enough, melting of ice cream that, that espresso gets diluted by sweet creamy delicious ice cream, and the first bite to the last until you're scraping out, every last drop from the bottom of that cup. It's all delicious. If you really wanna mess with your espresso, I would, perhaps on the side of a more ristretto shot, than more of a longer shot. Chilling it down will enhance any mild bitterness in the short, whereas that little bit of sugar will mitigate any slight imbalance in acidity. So you can go just a little bit shorter on your shots if you want to. I mean, I still want a two to one ratio in my espresso. I just want the espresso to taste as good as it can. But if you wanna play it, that's how you can play. So, cheers. That is very good. That is, coffee first. And then there's nice little pulp of vanilla. It's not like a dominant vanilla node. But it finishes, is really Kind of milky lovely finish which, you need good milk. Like there's no point during this recipe, if you're not using a really good milk. But, if you're making coffee, you should be using really good milk anyway. So, shout out to Northiam Dairy, Dan and Kent, they do a great job. That coffee is just, a little bit sweet, a little bit creamy. The cold cup definitely helps bring the temperature down without melting too much ice cream. That's really good. That's really good. You should try this. You really should try this. This is very good. Should we put this on a Proof Rock? Leave a comment down below if you think we should do that. We will do that. Maybe, it'll be available on the streets of London. I hope you try this.", "videoID": "u7qCzZCoI2M"}, {"title": "The Mahlk\u00f6nig EK-43S (Episode #3)", "text": "Welcome to episode three of the \"Ultimate Grinder Showdown.\" Today, we're looking at the Mahlk\u00f6nig EK43S. And I think it's safe to say, that this is probably the most influential piece of coffee equipment in the last 10 years. First, some history of this company and this grinder. So Mahlk\u00f6nig as a company goes back to 1924. They weren't called Mahlk\u00f6nig then, but they made motors for grinders or mixers or food processing, that kind of stuff. They began to concentrate on coffee grinders in the 1960s and trade more heavily under the Mahlk\u00f6nig brand. They actually formally became Mahlk\u00f6nig in 2005, but they're now part of the Hemro Group. Now at the end of the 1970s, they began to produce this model. Now, the name EK43 is not a beautiful name, but it does make some sense. The E stands for Einphasenstrom, which is the German for single phase. When it comes to motors and things like grinders, whether it is single phase or three phase, is really quite important. And you'll still see DK grinders from Mahlk\u00f6nig, which is Dreiphasenstrom, made today. So E for Einphasenstrom, K for Kaffee, the German spelling of coffee. 43 is the motor designation. There was a 23. They presume there was a 33, but no one seems to know anything about it. The S in this particular model is because this is a shorter version of that grinder. There were several different versions of this grinder made for different things. There was one for pepper, one for linseed, one for poppy seed, one for grains generally, and they had different letters after the E. So the EP was for pepper, in that particular case. It was a generally successful product from its initial sort of beginnings. It had its fans. It had people who didn't really care about it. It did do a pretty cool version called the EKK, which was sort of two hoppers, two grinders in one, and that was kind of fun. But it wasn't really until around 2009, 2010 that it had a dramatic change in its trajectory and came into the spotlight. So in 2009, 2010, a guy called Scott Rao is experimenting with his one in a cafe he was involved in at the time called Cafe Myriade in Montreal. And he noticed when brewing with his FETCO that he was able to push his extractions much higher than he had expected to taste good. 23, 24% of the coffee being extracted back then was a surprisingly high number. And that became part of the kind of workflow in that cafe. It was an influential cafe, and a few different people came by and learnt about this particular thing, one being a guy called Ben Kaminsky, who was the person who told me about this whole thing, and another, a guy called Matt Perger. Now, Matt would hugely popularize this grinder by using it as part of his World Barista Championship routine and talking about brewing espresso with this to achieve very high extraction yields. No one had really been doing that. And those of us had found out about this, we were starting to experiment and try to understand why was this doing this? What was special about this grinder? In truth, Mahlk\u00f6nig themselves had no idea this grinder was special. In fact, it was slated to be discontinued in 2013, though the boom in its popularity obviously prevented that from happening. It drove the conversation about more unimodal grinding, more evenness in grinding and how that can impact extraction, how we can have higher extractions, potentially better tasting coffee as a result. And this thing just boomed in popularity; Mahlk\u00f6nig could not make enough of these things, and today it's still struggled to keep up with demand. They're a staple in just about every specialty coffee shop around the world. They are still incredibly popular. Now, despite all of this, despite its influence, despite how clearly excellent it is at what it does, reviewing it here does feel a little bit unfair. Of these five grinders, this is different from the others because it's built first and foremost for a commercial environment. That has a number of different impacts, but we'll start with an obvious one, which is the price. This thing typically costs around $3,000, but prices will fluctuate because the distribution of this grinder is different to all the other grinders I'm reviewing. With the other grinders, I bought them direct from manufacturer, shipped from wherever they were in the world, to me here. With this, with commercial equipment, distribution works differently. Mahlk\u00f6nig would have built this grinder and sold it to a national distributor. And that national distributor probably didn't sell it to an end user or to a cafe. It probably went through a dealer. And so, typically, with this kind of model, you end up with the person who sells it to the cafe or the end user, being able to offer them more support because they're local to them or something like that. But this kind of distribution model means that there are several businesses between manufacturer and user making some money. And so while this might be a $3,000 grinder, that certainly isn't what Mahlk\u00f6nig as a manufacturer would have charged for it. And so its distribution model is definitely a challenge when it comes to competing with these other grinders. However, Mahlk\u00f6nig as a manufacturer has an advantage that these other grinder manufacturers do not. And that is scale. Mahlk\u00f6nig builds tens of thousands of grinders a year, possibly more. They are manufacturing an enormous number of these, and that brings costs down in both parts and labor costs. They have built production around high volume, and that makes it cheaper to make. In the case of some of these grinders, they're being built by hand, by passionate people who might even own the company that you're buying from. It's a very different model, and that's worth bringing up. And secondly, because it's built for cafes, that has a massive impact on its workflow and its purpose. Now, in the other grinders, I've talked about accessories. This comes with none, nothing whatsoever, nothing to weigh into, nothing to grind into, not a thing. Now, typically this might go to a cafe, who if they're using it for, say, batch brewing, they'd probably be weighing the beans out in the paper filter, pouring it in, and grinding it back into the paper filter for a FETCO or a BUNN or something like that and brewing that way. Or most commonly, they're gonna use it to grind a bag of coffee for a customer to take home. A lot about this part of the grinder here is built around grinding bags of coffee because that's kind of what a lot of people use it for, and it needs to be very good at that. At home, your requirements are very different. You're not gonna be grinding a hundred grams of coffee for a FETCO brew, you're not gonna be grinding 250 grams of coffee for a bag of something to give to a friend or family member. Realistically, you're gonna be grinding 20 grams of coffee at a time. And I don't really think this is built for that. I'm gonna seem a little bit negative about this because ultimately it does a good thing. It grinds in a more uniform manner, and it helps coffee taste better at higher extractions. That isn't really up for debate, but it's not built really to do it in the home. It's just not. And so using it at home is often a less enjoyable experience than using it in a cafe is. Now, there have been lots of cafes that have tried to adapt this to to grind coffee for every single espresso that they pull. And you've seen people sort of create and manufacturer additional items to help make that a more enjoyable part of the process, but those are expensive, and, ultimately, it's still kind of a convoluted workflow. But let's talk through the grinder just very quickly. You can see at the back here a very large motor mounted on this little stand here. The normal EK has a larger piece here, raising it up higher, making it easier to get a bigger bag underneath. People began modding these themselves, and so Mahlk\u00f6nig kind of copied that and made a shorter version. The dial on the front goes from 0 round to 16, and that's your grind setting. And again, smaller the number, finer the grind. At 0, you're typically finer than you would need for espresso. And at 16, you're probably coarser than you would need for something like a French press or something else that you might wanna brew with a coarse grind, maybe cold brew if that's your thing. It really does cover a full grind spectrum, and it does grind well across every setting. One small complaint from the get-go is that they built this model to be shorter, and that's good, especially for the home, but what they chose to do was put on a very large hopper on the top of it. I don't really understand why they decided to put such a long, tall hopper here if they're making a shorter grinder. It really makes no sense to me. I will also say that the quality control on the hoppers generally has been a bit of a problem. I broke this hopper almost instantly upon using it. It's got quite a difficult mechanism that it locks onto the top of this with, there's a little gasket inside here and it sort of clicks in. In the case of this one, the glue around the edge here and on here was very poorly done. And so it came almost straight off when I tried to unlock the hopper. That's really disappointing, and ultimately this should be a better piece. I will say that replacing this with a better hopper would be high on my list if I had one of these at home. In addition, the hopper has a little sort of gate on there. Some of the old ones would have a gate that swung out but remained attached, so you didn't pull it all the way out. This one, you pull it all the way out. And I don't actually like that, 'cause getting it back in again is a bit fussy. You've got your vertically mounted burr set here, a very large burr set as well. Coffee drops sort of through them and down. That's a very smart way to approach things. Now, in terms of accessing the burrs on this thing, it's not particularly difficult, but it does require tools. So you're gonna open up the two screws here. You'll be able to take this front piece off and access the burrs that way. It's not a particularly painful thing, but it's not as easy as some of the other grinders in there. But once you're inside, you'll see there's some pretty chunky burrs in there. Now the styling on this grinder is, I would say, iconic at this point, but I don't think it's super beautiful. If you look back at some of the grinders they used to make, like the W1BN, which was built in the '50s and '60s, that I think is super beautiful. And here, end of the '70s, beginning of the '80s, a lot more boxier, straight lines. I think that's kind of a shame. Now, I guess what we should do is probably pull a shot of espresso and talk about that part of the process. Now, again, I'm gonna be using a spray bottle for my doses because it does reduce the staticky mess around one of these things. Again, it doesn't come with a spray bottle. There's no recommendation to use one, but from my point of view, I certainly prefer it that way. Now, when you're grinding for espresso, you're obviously not gonna put a portafilter underneath it here because a terrible mess would ensue, and that's just not recommended. I'm gonna use the little dosing cap from a niche grinder 'cause that works super well. It's a little bit surprising to me that the EK43S in particular does not come with something to grind it into. The S is definitely even more popular with people at home rather than cafes, but you get nothing, which is kind of a shame. Now, when it comes to grinding, the motor is relatively loud. But it does grind very quickly. Now, it does have a very effective knocker, but that's really built to be a bag knocker. You can see from the shape of this piece here, this is designed for a retail bag, to sit inside a retail bag. And the knocker is designed to prevent a buildup of ground coffee around the exit here, keep it moving into the bag below. It works fine to help clear it, but this whole awkward piece here really isn't designed for dosing some coffee for an espresso shot. Now, with the style of espresso that people pull on an EK, it's typically a longer shot. It's not like a two to one. It's more like a three to one, in some cases, a much larger espresso. And that's very common for unimodal style grinders. The espresso you get from it is balanced. It is sweet, it is clean, but it doesn't have a ton of texture. And that's a function of both unimodal grinders, as well as those larger espresso ratios that you typically use to get good espresso from them. I enjoy this style of espresso though. I often find myself missing a little bit of texture. Now, when it comes to dialing these things in, they are fussy and finicky and quite frustrating. Retention is a little bit of an issue with this grinder, wherein you'd almost benefit from a little purge in between grind settings in a way that some other grinders don't really need. But with this one, I would recommend it. Otherwise, you can find yourself chasing a grind setting around and around and around, and in my experience, where a coffee might be set first thing in the morning or on one day, you might need to dial it in again the next day. It's a little bit more of a chase. Some people don't really struggle with this, but I've generally needed to redial in fairly often with this with one particular coffee. Your mileage may vary. Now, this is probably more commonly used for filter coffee than it is for espresso. And we'll be testing filter coffee extractions against the other grinders in that big showdown video at the end of this week. Obviously, it's very good at what it does. Otherwise, it wouldn't have had the impact that it had. It wouldn't have become the most popular grinder in specialty coffee shops around the world. It wouldn't have generated the hype, the interest, the research, everything that has gone along with it. This is a hugely influential grinder, and you can't really argue that it isn't good at what it does when you look at the impact that it's had on the coffee industry. And so you might be a little bit confused because initially it seems like I've had a bit of a rant against this thing, but now I'm saying it's great at what it does. And I feel like I'd hold those two opinions and not feel any cognitive dissonance. It is a great grinder for a cafe. I don't really think it belongs at home. In these videos, we haven't talked a ton about alignment, how perfectly aligned the two burrs are to make sure there's no wobbling, or no variance in grind size as they spin. Historically, EK43s have needed some help with alignment. And that's frustrated a lot of people. This is an expensive grinder. Why doesn't it come out of the box, perfectly aligned? And I can't speak on behalf of Mahlk\u00f6nig here, but the number of grinders they're dealing with is so much higher than almost any other manufacturer who's obsessing about these kind of tolerances. Historically, these had kind of been all over the place sometimes. The alignment had been a problem. And with all of these reviews, I'm not touching that with these grinders. I'm reviewing them as stock because I think that's fair. As a consumer, you should review what you get. You shouldn't be reviewing the modified, tweaked, improved versions of those things. But it has been an issue with these grinders, and it is seemingly getting better, though I do worry a little bit about the QC with them, with the volume that they're producing. And it's the little details. It's the fact that my hopper broke almost instantly. It's the fact that these stickers, which they've now changed, but mine are just peeling off already, and it's less than a month old. These little details, they do bother me, and they would bother me all the more if I'd bought this to use at home where I have a different kind of relationship than I would do in a cafe where I needed it to be a workhorse. And it is a good, solid workhorse. And so I can't avoid talking about this grinder as part of this week's grinder reviews because it is so influential, it is so important in coffee, but it does sit out of place compared to the other grinders because it's built for a cafe, and it's not built for home. I will continue to buy these for businesses. I will continue to use these almost every day. But would I recommend that you put one in your home? I don't know. You'd have to think carefully about your workflow, how you wanna work. And for the price point, does it deliver the best results? I will say it produces great tasting coffee, no question. And when they're very well aligned, really delicious coffee, really very good. I have no complaints about the quality that these things can produce at all. But I am looking forward to pitting it head to head in both espresso and filter coffee against these other grinders. Now, I don't get to keep this one. I'm gonna give this one away to one of my Patreon backers because Patreon gives me a budget every month to go and buy these grinders, not be relying on freebies or loaners or that kind of stuff. I can buy them, review them, tell you my honest thoughts, and at the end, I can give them away.", "videoID": "ROBoq7kYuNE"}, {"title": "Review\uff1a PBR Hard Coffee", "text": "I don't know about you but I certainly have Pabst Blue Ribbon on my mind.

And two, the reviews haven't been that bad. This might not be awful. Let me just tell you how they described it. This Java brew balances, a rich creamy blend with a whipped vanilla flavor. What is whipped vanilla? It's 5% alcohol. It appears to have coffee in it. It's a malt beverage with natural and artificial flavors and it does contain milk. Now this has been made nice and icy cold because there's no way I'm drinking this warm and let's, let's get into it. Good sound good sound. That smells quite nice. That smells pretty good. Let's let's have a little look, look at it a bit. Ooh, you sort of hoped that it would have like a little nitro goodness to it or something because it's just that, that, that color. This is why. Look, this is a divergence, but I think coffee drinks like like milk drinks served in glass. Look, terrible. Coffee has a great color. It's beautiful. Except when you mix it with milk and it goes gray, Brown. This is not an appetizing color. This is why, you know, ceramic cups. I just liked that way better than glass. But here we go. Got a little, little whiff of booze has got a little kind of chocolate milk thing going on here. Okay. Cheers   To whoever has given this a good review, shame on you. Shame on you. Look it's sweet. God it's Sweet. Ugh its sweet, and it's got this kind of chocolate malt milk thing at the start. And then it goes wrong. Then comes this grotesque ugly flavor of coffee awful to just, I don't know, punish you for existing. I mean, it gets bad pretty quickly. And then here comes the coffee. It's that same nasty cheap fake coffee taste that fades slowly leaving you with a sort of overly sweet chocolate milk thing. It, it doesn't taste particularly boozy because there's too many competing, awful things vying for your attention going me, me, look at me. I'm disgusting. This is bad. I was, I was hopeful that this might be okay. And people online had been positive about this. I had read at least one good review. That is just terrible. It's terrible. It's don't buy this.

Obviously But I'm going to compare and contrast it to two other options that I think will give us the best kind of information overall So first thing I'm going to do, it is not use this The first thing we're going to do is grab a regular pouring kettle, boil some water and then I'm going to make it v60 I'm going to do a relatively small v60 because this has a 350 ml capacity, so I'll brew 21 to 350 to sort of max out the jug, but I'll do that first of all With very nice fancy pouring kettle and then I'll do it with an electric one after this one and then we're going to track the temperature in the v60 using a little data logger and we'll see what we see freshly boiled kettle Let's put a similar amount in, let's not fill it all the way but close to that 350 line and here we go Now I've got a data logger running in here This is the very traditional kettle experience. Now you probably see me make a v60 before. If you haven't seen me make a v60 before, I'll leave a link up here So you can follow along. Every once is a very enjoyable experience. It's what I would expect This is a particularly nice pouring kettle. It's got a nice rubberized handle as well Now interestingly the peak temperature and this brew when I didn't preheat this kettle was only 85 degrees Celsius Now you can argue you should always preheat your pouring kettle and then the past, I have made exactly that argument But I just want to see how it compares. I won't be preheating this and I will be performing the same experiment So that should be pretty interesting. 3 minutes 30 seconds. So now we've got a benchmark of sorts. we can do the same test again with this thing We're just gonna start my data logger, very interesting little experience Hmm You've got all the control for sure pouring with this thing That's been relatively easy to do. Now that size, I'll talk about it now 350 ml, is a little bit small for me. If I'm honest, I think it could be bigger. I wish already that it would do a half liter brew, which it sadly doesn't. You could top-up as you were pouring But that would be a little bit more faff You'd probably get some better thermal retention if your hot water was partially kept in a hot kettle low now as you pour, it does feel very light in the hand. It lacks the heft of a pouring kettle so you can see why I called it the air But it does feel Much much lighter. It's kind of weird actually to be pouring from something like this and When you're pouring with a pouring kettle you can get a nice kind of circular motion going This this sort of lacks the momentum for that So it's actually a little bit more of an intentional experience when you're pouring with this thing And these last few bits feel quite prickly There overall the flow has been pretty easy Just with control I mean a quick look at my data logger It would seem that the temperature got a little bit higher than the metal kettle but not much higher at all It peaked out at around 86 degrees Celsius. So at 3:20 the brews done Now for the last test which we're going to take an electric pouring kettle so that will be as hot as it's possible And we'll do exactly the same thing all over again with that It's that heavy kettle feeling but obviously expect this to be much hotter This is boiled here in this kettle. It's got a big thermal mass of metal around it It should be the hottest brew. Notably. The question is how much hotter is it going to be then either of the two options? Now I poured a little bit quicker than I meant to on that brew and that is one of the things about heavier kettles It's a little bit easier To pour more than you want to. I actually felt like I maybe had a touch more control with the lighter of the two options It was harder to just you know, throw a bit more water in that way looking at the logger right now It did achieve a much much higher temperature. It went up to about 91 degrees Celsius at its peak, which is notably hotter than the other two, so unquestionably Decanting does play a role in in dropping the temperature of your brew and generally speaking, I do prefer higher temperature brews So for our last test We have aggressively preheated this little jug just to see if that makes any difference and you can see Steam happening here. And the more of evaporation that's going to happen. And the more open surface area you have the more evaporation you gonna have the more evaporative cooling you're gonna have. The faster the liquid in this jug is gonna cool down Regardless of how warm the jacket is around it. I do like pouring with it though it's It's quite a pleasurable experience all around like it's a nice Jug to pour from it's a little different in terms of muscle memory. I suppose if you've done this a lot but Yeah, it's alright. So looking at this now. I can already see the max temperature. We've reached was just below 88 degrees Celsius so we gained a couple degrees there was a benefit, but we're still not as close as An actual kettle, I think a lid could be an interesting addition to this to really help improve its thermal stability And I also think having it be a little bit bigger and having a bigger mass of water inside It would be a nice way to improve its thermal stability, too but if you like brewing at cooler temperatures if you like more developed roasts that You don't want to bring out that slightly harsher side and you want to brew that little bit cooler That's certainly not a problem. And with lighter roasts Yeah going hotter might be a little bit better, but it is a world of diminishing returns I like to go as hot as I can because generally speaking I find that tastes the best But I don't anticipate these brews tasting particularly bad. 3:30, on the money that bridge done I suppose we should do a little tasting and wrap up some thoughts. So we're just a quick taste And what's interesting is that these three brews are kind of ascending very slightly in temperature. But otherwise, we're very very similar Now this is poor science because this isn't blind it's very obvious which is which that different temperatures to start with and in addition I do have confirmation bias here in that. I generally prefer higher temperatures And so I'm more likely to lean towards the one that does come from a higher temperature But I would say there is a small increase in sweetness each time as we go up all cups are pretty enjoyable Actually, I wouldn't be upset to be served any of these to improve them myself. I would be perfectly happy to drink all three But I do prefer them a little bit hotter. So what about this? It's a it's an intense piece of design It's pretty shocking to look at. It looks a little bit like a bird, a little bit like a plague doctor It's it's a weird looking thing, but it works. It's quite pleasant to pour with It's definitely a different experience but you've got all the control you could ever need. Now, right now in Japan This is pretty cheap. 1,400 yen.", "videoID": "jB29c185UK8"}, {"title": "Reviewing My AliExpress Coffee Equipment Haul", "text": "Hi, I have been shopping on AliExpress. And today we're gonna go through my purchases. Have I done a good job? Have I found maybe some hidden gems? Let's find out. Oops. I need some hair product. So let me explain how we chose the things that are on the bench in front of me, because if you've been on AliExpress to look for coffee stuff you probably felt like I felt, which is completely overwhelmed. Now, in choosing stuff, I chose things that I genuinely wanted to test and try. Some of them are a little bit ridiculous, I'm not gonna lie to you. Some them are kind of entertaining, and we're gonna break it up into four sections. We're gonna do brewing first, like filter coffee brewing, sort of. Then we're gonna do latte art for reasons that will make sense, because after that is espresso. Then after that, just briefly, it's a little coffee roasting. We actually didn't pick any grinders because I do feel like grinders from AliExpress is perhaps its own video in the future. So this is just not grinders. Straight away, I feel like I've lied to you because the first brew method we're gonna look at is a kind of Turkish coffee brewer. Lots of different names for this style of brewing, but what I was most interested in wasn't the brewing pot, it wasn't the free coffee that came with it, it was this thing here. Now, this is a sand heater which is a very traditional way of heating or brewing Turkish coffee. Brewing with sand, using that as the heat source means that you sort of cover all around, just jacket the brewer. Rather than having a heat source at the base, this will be kind of all around, which is kind of, I don't know, different. This is the other thing I'm gonna use with it. This is very exciting to me. I've long complained about scoops. I've said, \"Scoops are bad, use scales.\" But this says, \"Why not both?\" It's a scoop scale. It's kind of more bulbous than I expected, if I'm honest. You can use this to weigh as you scoop. So you've got an on off button, a mode button, and a hold button. I'm gonna tare mine, and now we're gonna get seven grams of coffee. I'm gonna use the stuff that came with this Turkish coffee maker because, I don't know, why not? Oh, 7.5, a little bit less. 8.7. Okay, how about you? 6.8, I'm gonna go with it. I gotta say from a workflow perspective, no, I thought this would be joyful, it's miserable. Anyway, in you go. Now, I haven't covered this kind of brewing on the channel before, and so, I'm just gonna go with a kind of popular recipe for it where we're gonna do sort of 10 to one. So seven grams of coffee, 70 grams of water in 60 degrees Celsius. And aiming for a brew time of two to two and a half minutes. Now, I don't really know what temperature I should set my sand. Didn't think I'd say that today. Let's go with a hundred. Let's have a little look at the temperature here. This sand is 150 degrees Celsius right now. It's getting hot real quick. Is something smoking? This is emanating a very terrible smell, like burnt old fish. Get in that sand. Sand's at like deep-frying temperatures. So 150, 170, somewhere around there. It's pretty hot. It's pretty hot. I didn't think it would be that hot that fast. I also didn't think smoke would be coming out of it occasionally. So at \u00a3130, a questionably built hot plate, a small bag of sand, and a decorative outer, I'm not sold that this is a good idea or good value, but you've got free coffee so, and okay, we have foam, and then we're gonna pour, wait a little while for those grounds to sink to the bottom, and then we'll have a taste. Now, I'm not sold on the actual coffee that we started with, but we'll see. I'm not sure I can blame the brewer. That's not my favorite tasting coffee. I'd love to learn how to use one properly, understand the sort of tips and techniques of that, and maybe I'll go and maybe I'll find that out one day and make a video about it. But, for now, from a safety perspective alone, let alone smell or anything else, probably a no. So this is the brewed coffee stuff that's left over. I'll just run through it really quickly. We have a collapsible travel kettle. Very exciting. I bought a refractometer. There's this kind of coffee brewer that loads of people ask me about, like a lot of you. There's this self-stirring mug. This, what I think is like a ember-style smart thermos, and then this carafe just had a great box. The refractometer, I'm actually not gonna test and review, because when I bought it and it arrived, I was kind of terrified. Because to review this properly, needed lots of science, lots of testing, lots of validation, and so thank you Lance Hedrick for doing all of that in a recent video. This turns out to be not very good. Probably don't buy this. Check Lance's video if you wanna know why. So yeah, no. Buy a better refractometer. To sort of test as many of these things as possible we're gonna brew coffee with this thing. It's battery powered in here. Takes a couple of double A batteries. So in here, there's a little metal filter. It's gonna hold your coffee. This sits on top, and then it will rotate this thing where you put your boiling water in to a max-fill line, and it will gently spin it for you to do a kind of automatic, swirly pour over very slowly. and brew it maybe into, well this. I'm excited for this part of the experience. There's like a little dial on the side here. If this is a temperature-controlled collapsible kettle, that would be kind of amazing. I'm just gonna, I think tell it to boil. I guess, that's boil. Ooh!  Angry, snappy lid. Now I do have some bad news. Having checked the price, including shipping, delivery, everything else, this was \u00a3100. Which is maybe too much money. Let me get some coffee. I will continue to use the scoop I don't like. I just feel like I have to give it a fair go. I was so excited for it and it feels so, so terrible. What do you say? You say 11.2. 8.5, never mind. On the lid of the brewer, it does say 10 grams to 150 grams. So that's what I'm doing. A little bit finer than I'd normally grind a pour over. You've just woken up, welcome. Classic metal filter, plastic mesh. Just quickly, the magnetic-stirring mug is chaos. It's got a little sort of pill, and it's spun by a sort of magnet motor underneath the base. So if you drop it in,  it sticks just there, and if you turn it on,  it went in the coffee. I presume it is more controlled when there's liquid inside, but we're gonna find out. And just so you can see, when I push the button, where's the button?  The top will spin. Gonna say, a bit of a flaw with the kettle. You sort of want a detachable base for a kettle, cuz now the cord is very short. That's the whole cord. I'm gonna have to unplug the cord, pour my water in  and go. Now, it feels like the flow rate's much faster at the start when there's more water in. I wonder if pulsing water in might sort of help slow the flow. Ground, relatively fine, but it's brewing pretty quickly. Nice, even a flat bed below. We've made coffee. I feel like I'm not sure if I should leave the lid off for this for the first time I spin it. So, I'm gonna put the lid on to spin it. It's a big mug. Our 150 mls left lots of space inside. Here we go. Oh! Okay, that's messy but it looks kinda cool. That's definitely a lid on experience, if I'm honest. Better than I thought, but it's good coffee, good water, good grinder. I feel like this brewer probably brews a bit cool. Probably works better with dark and more developed roasts that you wanna brew as filter coffee. I would say that's not the best brewer for lighter roasts, but it is kind of fun, and I'm kind of into battery-powered brewers. Not the best, not the worst, not the best. Now to talk about this mug, I actually need to empty it. So I'll put this coffee into my smart thermos. Little strainer inside is a bonus. Some silica gel, always a delicious treat. Don't eat it. You currently say 24 C, that's a lie. How do I make you on? It's doing the ambient air temperature inside, which I guess will equalize eventually, but it's not telling me the temperature of the liquid in the base. I wouldn't recommend it. I don't think that's very useful. This is powered by triple A batteries that live under this very flimsy thing here. Like this doesn't seal meaningfully. There's just two batteries there. This is a mug. You might wanna wash it now and again, I don't think that's a good idea to just have a battery door that's just a flimsy piece of silicon that just sort of vaguely squishes into place. I kind of always wanted an auto-stirring mug even though I don't take milk or cream in my coffee. But the idea of a spinny thing always just pleased me. But this one, maybe I wouldn't recommend solely because it just feels like you're gonna break it the minute you wash it. I'm still cross with this. I'm trying, if I turn it upside down, it thinks it's 37, so this doesn't work. This just doesn't work. Okay, let's put this into this beautiful carafe because that actually is pretty great. I'm actually pretty into this nice, little amber glass jug. It was \u00a311.20 delivered, which is actually cheap. It's cheap, and I feel like that's good value. It also has a hilarious box. I think it does up to 400 mls, \u00a311.20. I like it. So, to recap: the kettle - way too expensive, wildly inconvenient, but collapsible and kind of fun. Refractometer. Lance says avoid it. I listened to Lance. This thing for more developed roasts, fun, kind of enjoyable. This thing did not work, don't really get it. This: very nice. I like it. And then, the stirring mug, maybe great once. Let's talk about latte art because that's where I'm getting pretty excited. I'm not gonna lie, this is the main event. This is it. This enormous thing here is, by far, the most expensive thing we bought. It was \u00a31500 delivered. But it's the most exciting, wonderful, amazing thing. It's a latte art printer. It prints art on lattes. It doesn't just draw the squiggles that we do with milk pitchers. This is a full color latte art printer. This is the Evebot. This, when you install it the first time and you put it together, you connect it to the wifi, and you are gonna talk to it through the internet. You can, through a QR code, upload any image you like to this thing. Then, at the push of a button, it will print said image onto a cup of coffee. Now, this one is full color - full color! They do say on the website there's little certificates and stuff, this is food safe. You pull out the little cartridge, it looks like a printer ink cartridge. Apparently, you should not consume regular printer ink. But apparently this is okay. So I need an image, a little selfie. Let's go with a horrified me. All I have to do now is scan a QR code, and I upload from my photo library. Let's choose disgusted me. I think I can just go full, full face. That's what I'm proposing to print. I have arrived on screen, I get print options. I get to choose how I print my face. Let's find a cup to print into, and I actually have one just here. This, I bought believing it was an espresso cup and that, it turns out, was a lie. Not, not an espresso cup. This handle, like as an espresso cup size, might be okay. It's just super weird this big. Okay, we're looking at a print diameter of about 78mm. So I'm gonna take you up to 78mm three inches, three inches across. This brings us to this, which I am also very excited about. This is a steaming unit, a milk-steaming unit. It's just for making steam. We have to put it on the heat. It will boil water inside it, trap it. It'll show as a pressure gauge. We've got a steam arm, little cool touch side here and a valve, and it came with no instructions. I've checked, it's not induction friendly so we're gonna stick it on a gas stove, put some water in it, and we'll see how it works. A lot of you wanted to see an electric version of this. We tried to buy that several times, and it ultimately just didn't work out, which is very frustrating 'cause I wanna know if it's good too. I'll be steaming milk in this little steam pitcher. I liked this little temperature grading on the side here. Let you know how hot or cold your milk is as you're steaming. Very useful. We're gonna be aiming for maybe 55, 60 degrees Celsius, which is the upper end honestly of this thing, which is interesting. So when it gets to 120, I'm gonna leave it on the heat but drop the heat really low, and I'm gonna have to turn it around to face me. We'll try and show you both the gauge, and the temperature gauge on the side of the jug. See how those are. Let's see how you are to purge. Whoa. Ready. Here we go. Now trying to find a vortex position. It's not bad pressure. So I have to say, texture from this, great, flawless, perfect. It seems really nicely. I really quite like using it. It brings me no pleasure to tell you that it costs nearly \u00a3300 delivered in the UK, which is a bit too expensive. And at this point, you're not far away from one of the sort of better cheap machines  that can steam milk automatically and do as good a job, sometimes, better than me. Anyway, no coffee 'cause I wanna give this thing a canvas, a blank canvas to work with. Pour, pour. All right. Now we make... art? Go   Oh no. Missing a little color. I feel like the cartridge maybe isn't printing to its fullest potential. It's skewing a little green, maybe an issue with a little bit of magenta not quite coming out right. It leaves me no choice but to taste my face. Sorry face. They have no flavor. Okay, that feels reassuring. Let me just get a bit more printer ink, is that wise? I feel like it should have a flavor but it doesn't, it doesn't have a flavor. That's amazing. How do you not want one of these? Obviously, it's \u00a31,500 for something you might use three times, and it would probably terrify someone to serve them a literal printed picture from a printer on their coffee. Think of the potential, I don't know why it exists. In summary, not super into this. I felt it was very laggy, not the best. This, I really liked that thing. I really like steaming with it. It's just way, way too much money. And this is way, way, way, way too much money. It's a printer, it needs a lot of maintenance, it needs inks. Those are expensive. It does a ridiculous thing. But aren't you glad that it exists? Now, there's one more item here. It's billed, on the website, as a latte art pen. And it's this strange-looking object, it's a bird. It's like a little bird. It's got a button in it, and you put chocolate powder inside it, and then you can draw with your chocolate powder, which is not latte art. I felt like that's a lie, and I'm cross about it from the start. But let's see how it works. Loading this feels like it's gonna go wrong. I've gotta get the chocolate powder into there. I guess, there's probably like a little vibrating motor in here. Let's see what happens. Come on now. That doesn't work. That doesn't work. That doesn't work. It's three \u00a33.30, more fool me. I just thought that might work, but it clearly doesn't. Maybe it needs a coarser grade of oh, oh. No, no it's rubbish. I thought that would let me draw beautiful patterns of chocolate powder or, you know, crass images. Either way, I can't do anything with this. It's useless. Let's go through the espresso stuff that we bought. A couple of espresso machines, which we'll get into. But to use them, we're gonna use some of the accessories that I bought, and there's a mix of accessories. One of them, I can't really use today but I just love it. This weird-looking creature is made of just silicon, and it's for filling your espresso machine tank when the tank is tucked back underneath your counter, and you just put this on top, pour the water in, and it just sort of, I don't know, periscopes it to the back. That's not the right word, but it'll do. I bought three things from one particular store because that store looks like one of the most legit stores for coffee on AliExpress, and that's MHW-3Bomber. I bought this box, this sort of like tamping station knock box stuff. I brought this espresso brush for cleaning baskets, which I presume isn't gonna work that well. I just wanted to know. Dual wall glassware's been around for a while. I think Bodum were really the company that started it. And so, I thought I would try their little cute dual wall espresso glass thing. When the Niche came out, everyone loved the idea of having a dosing cup that fit a 58mm portafilter, but Niche didn't sell their dosing cup to anyone else. So people have started to make dosing cups. So I got one just to see how it is. This is not like the forced tamper, this just sort of has a depth meter. We'll see how it is. Now, these are big, chunky manual, 58mm lever machines. On paper, these looked kind of cheap, but by the time that they were shipped and kind of went through delivery and customs clearance, all the additional fees, they were both much more expensive. Close in price to the Flair Pro, and the Flair Pro is different to them because it has an active heating unit and these don't, which is gonna be a lot of what I talk about here. Let's make some coffee with maybe this one first. A quick look through, you get a tamper, got a gauge on the front with a creature on it. Nice portafilter, wood handle, very nice. Weird locking mechanism. Feels kind of, I don't know, you gotta get like a weird way round, and then you're sort of pushing further. Feels kinda strange. But my biggest concern is this enormous piece of metal which is very heavy, and also right now about 20 degrees Celsius, which is a long way from the desired temperature of this metal, which is 93, 94 degrees Celsius, something around brew temperature, because when I put 60, 70, 80 mls of hot water into this, that water very quickly will go down towards 20 degrees Celsius, and this will not come up to temperature very much, 'cos the mass is so much higher than the water. I guess to try and get the best out of this, I'll do a couple of rounds of preheating, but that already is kind of a pain and a waste and annoying. Yeah, that's like, ooh, 50 max Celsius. I'm not sure how I can review a tin. Does it fit? Oh, a little bit smaller. So maybe, actually, not bad if you were using, say, a 57mm portafilter and wanted something that fit that as well. But yeah, as a starting point, nice distribution. Yeah, I have nothing bad to say about that at all. This tamping station is very good. I like it. It's well made. It feels solid. In we go. Fresh, boiling water. Go for a little pre-infusion. A little gentle pressure till we get the first drops. And let's pull the pressure up a little bit. Let's go for like, six. Now, if you're looking at that coffee, it does not look quite right, that does not look good. Very pale, wispy crema. Funny looking color. I would say, with a very high degree of confidence that this probably got nowhere near 80 degrees Celsius as a brew temperature. That's not gonna taste good. Mm. So, in your dual wall glass, which tends to retain a lot of heat, that's very sippably warm, wildly acidic, sour, sour, sour, sour, sour. And that's just not hot enough. I just don't know practically how you would use something like that and get really good results unless you wanted weirdly low brew temperatures. This one's a little different but also kind of the same. Let's have a look. Of course, time to check the knock box part of this. Does this feel like a satisfying thunk? Does it feel loud and rattly?  Nice. Of course, have to test the brush. That looks pretty clean. Just have a taste. If you run your finger on the inside of the basket, stuff still came off. Taste it. Not very good. Not something I would want to contribute to my next cup of coffee. That's why I prefer something like a sort of microfiber cloth to get rid of everything that you can that's inside there and leave you a kind of neutral starting point. So this one has a slightly more kind of chaotic vibe to me. Did come with a dosing ring. That's always appreciated and got a nice looking tamper, if you like that kind of a thing. This lever, if you lift it all the way up - that's really hard to do. It's quite a tight fit in the chamber. Whew! That was... physical. So this piece actually just comes out. Portafilter, that's nice. And so, you can sort of see, there's a pretty typical shower screen at the bottom there. You've got a gauge, which is at a slightly weird angle when the whole thing's put together. This is still a substantial piece of metal. This weighs about 1.2 kilos. Preheating this adequately would require a decent amount of boiling water. I don't really know why it comes to pieces like this. If you slide it all away, it's actually now off center with the piston. So it needs to come back a little bit to then be sort of centered. I've got some coffee. This has been preheated three times, and before we start, we found another small problem. When the lever's all the way down, which is the typical position where you'd want to then use the portafilter well, this is in the way. So you've gotta sort of lift a little bit to get the portafilter out. I don't like how sort of loose this feels. This is gonna be full of hot pressurized water soon, and I don't like it. When we fill this with water, and when we partially lift this, that would allow water to drain through the sort of piston mechanism and start pre-infusion, and then you'd lift this up and press down. All right, in we go. All right, let's begin to drain the water in. Oh, so awkward to lift this. Okay, now the gauge goes all the way to 25 bars, which um... is a little out of spec. Now weirdly, the end of this lever starts hitting things like, whoa! (a loud pop!) I guess there was pressure still in there, and I let go of this enough that the mechanism that allows pre-infusion allowed some pressure out. I'm always torn in that situation whether to be like that was my fault for being an idiot or that's bad design, but I feel like you've gotta design products knowing that idiots like me will be using them. So, I'm gonna put that on design. That smells bad and looks bad and ... mm, tastes bad. Not as bad as the previous shot. So tastes hotter, slightly higher brew temps, that's a win. As an experience, I wouldn't like to use this machine if it stood between me and my first cup of coffee of the day. Overall, kind of fun, solid, weighty constructions. They don't feel like they're cheap in their build. They just feel both a little bit kind of uninformed in the design. Like, there's not enough real coffee knowledge in the design of these. To round us out, just a little bit of roasting. Now, I know this is immediately gonna make you say, \"When am I doing a roasting series on the channel?\" Good question. I don't know. Would I like to? I think I would. These kind of roasters you can buy online quite easily in different places. The pricing will go from, it seems like over a hundred, up to like \u00a3200. This one landed, delivered all costs about \u00a3155. Not cheap. Not cheap. And the way it works is pretty simple. There is a fan inside this, and there is a heating element. And the controls of this primarily control those two things. How hot is the element, how aggressive is the fan, and the heat of the air, and the quantity of air determine the speed of the roast. Typically, in commercial roasting, you would reduce the heat throughout roasting. So you'd have your sort of maximum heat at the start broadly, and then it would sort of taper down. We're not gonna have any real insight into what's happening in the roasting chamber here other than looking at the beans. It has some sort of auto mode. We'll see how auto that is. A hundred gram capacity, 80 gram recommendation. That's what we're going with. So we'll open it up, put some coffee in. Now, there are instructions with this, which I have read, that are in English but a little bit confusing. That was um, noisy. Well, roast: bit of a mess. So I pulled this relatively light. Looking at it, it's not a very even roast. Now, to make it more difficult, this is a red honey coffee from Costa Rica. So the way that the beans will look on the outside is a little bit different to say, a washed coffee, and there will be a little bit more variation from that. But the roast was definitely too fast. Now, that's the automatic program but the fact that that's a 10-minute program of that level of aggression, this was gonna end up at the mythical third crack or as some call it, combustion. Well, probably not but very dark, very oily at that point. I'm gonna roast this again on manual mode this time. I definitely pulled it too early. I'm not saying it should have run the full 10 minutes 'cos it absolutely should not have run the full 10 minutes. Maybe get something that's gonna be drinkable. The beeps say we're done. This is actually my third roast, because my second roast was just bad also. That's the kind of truth of coffee roasting. You're gonna make a bunch of mistakes at the start, especially with a brand new roaster, and, you know, you should let this rest before tasting it. So you're gonna wait a few days to work out how you messed it up, and the whole thing takes a long time. It's gonna be maybe 20, 30 roasts before you kinda know this roaster, and its real flaws or limitations. If that doesn't appeal to you, then I should warn you, generally, away from home roasting. This is too fresh to taste good, but I know what you want. You want me to brew it and drink it anyway. Let's have a little smell. No. It's not my best roast. Ooh, that's smokey, harsh, bitter, bit too dark, also underdeveloped. It's good raw coffee that I've made taste a bit like commercial coffee. Not my best, not my best efforts. Honestly, if I was gonna get into a roaster like this, I would look for an existing model that has a community around it already that's gonna give you a lot of guidance and support. If you're going with something like this, you just don't know what heat setting 4 is, compared to other roasters. In terms of little complaints, the fan button's the wrong way around. I go more heat that way, I go more time that way, but I go more fan this way and that's confusing. It should be more fan, less fan, and it's the other way around. The mixing isn't great. Those little holes maybe aren't doing a good enough job of really mixing the coffee. I found a couple of beans that really hadn't moved very much and weren't properly developed. So that's a bit of a concern. Should you buy coffee stuff from AliExpress? Having, you know, bought a bunch of stuff that I thought I wanted to try and test, I have come to a conclusion. And the answer is maybe, sometimes, maybe. If you're looking for a cheap product, then in many cases, what the sticker price is is not what you're ultimately gonna pay, and by the time it's shipped and customs are cleared and all that kind of stuff, it may not be the bargain you hoped for. I think it's a good place to buy stuff if you have a specific tool in mind that you're looking for, then there are reputable sellers making great quality products out there. I would certainly recommend that. And there's some stuff here, little bits and pieces that I thought was really nice and worth keeping.", "videoID": "xs9F6-ldjDk"}, {"title": "A Coffee Cake (That Tastes of Coffee)", "text": "Today, we're going to talk about coffee cake and I need to make a very important distinction right at the start. This is British coffee cake, and it's not because I have some weird patriotism, it's because in this country coffee cake tastes of coffee. In America coffee cake is just a bland cake that you eat with coffee. I don't understand, what do you call cake that tastes of coffee? So we're going to do the British one, the one that actually tastes of coffee. How good can you get this to taste? This is the quest that I'm on today. Now, I'm not a baker, I'm not a professional chef of any kind. I'm a passionate enthusiast of all things cooking and food, but know this going in, I am not a pro baker. As I did my research for this there were a couple of things to note, almost all the recipes were a coffee and Walnut cake. For now we're just going to pay attention to the coffee. And that's kind of the second point, in none of the recipes that I read did anyone really particularly care about the coffee that went in? They just used instant coffee or specified instant espresso powder or something like that, but no one really cared about the coffee flavor. And that's what we do here, we care about coffee flavor. So the first thing we're going to do is actually look at the difference between using regular cheap instant and specialty instant. I'm going to make two different sponges, one with good incident, one with let's just call it bad instant and see if we could taste the difference. Now as a baseline recipe for the cake I'm going to go to Felicity Cloake. She wrote a column in the Guardian where she would just cook everyone else's recipes, work out what she liked and didn't, and then synthesize them into kind of one perfect little recipe at the end. But as a little twist I'm gonna do it slightly differently. So I'm going to go from more of a kind of sponge cake texture, where you cream the butter and sugar, you add your egg yolks to that, and then your flour to that, but separately you beat your egg whites and sugar together to get a kind of meringue phase going and you incorporate that as kind of part of the aeration phase to get a lighter, fluffier end result. Let's do that, let's get on with that, I'll walk you through what I'm doing and we'll bake good instant versus bad instant. So this recipe for a single spongecake starts with 60 grams of golden caster sugar, 112 grams of unsalted softened butter, and you cream them together at high speed for five or six minutes until fluffy, scraping down the sides as necessary. We're going to add two egg yolks, but one at a time and mixing completely before adding the second one. And then with the mixer on low we're going to add 112 grams of flour and seven grams of baking powder and mix until just combined. Then we're going to add five grams of instant coffee dissolved in 20 to 30 grams of water and allowed to cool. Now in a clean bowl, we're going to add two egg whites, 62 grams of golden caster, sugar, and two grams of salt. We're going to whip it on high until you've got pretty stiff peaks forming in the meringue. Fold the meringue into the batter about a third at a time, and just gently mix until fully combined. Grease and flour spring form cake pan and add your batter. Bake at 175 Celsius for about 25 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches 96 degrees Celsius. Give the cake a good hard tap on the counter when you take it out of the oven to assist with cooling, let it cool down, and I'll do everything again but this time using some specialty instant, in this case from the lovely people at 3fe in Dublin. So we've got two sponges here and they look pretty much the same, they baked in similar amounts of time. Technique-wise the same, the only difference really is the instant inside them. So how does that make them taste different? Now, I'm not going to lie to you, baking this thing with the Nescafe it still smelled pretty good. Now this smelled great too but once you add a good amount of fat and a good amount of sugar you're going to mask a fair bit of coffee flavor and that might work in Nescafe's favor. I don't think it's going to taste better, but it might not taste as bad as you'd think. Let's get into it. Okay, it starts out okay, then you get that kind of very Nescafe kick at the back end of it. The flavor's not very strong but let's try the specialty instant. No real surprise, but that is much better. Still not a ton of coffee flavor though. I should double check. I mean, it's good, it's way better than the Nescafe, it's definitely an upgrade, but I want more coffee flavor. And I can't help, but wonder why can't I use fresh coffee? Why can't I pour shots of the espresso? If many typical bakers were pouring shots of espresso in most home setups? Well, if you see how it's processed presented by, even food YouTube, they were going to be pulling much weaker, larger shots, adding a lot more liquid to the batter and probably not having great results. But if I can pull good espresso, strong espresso, delicious well-balanced espresso can I have a better result? Now this cake had about five grams of instant coffee in it. This one had about six and a half grams because typically in my experience specialty instant needs a higher dose when even making coffee out of it or anything else, it doesn't seem to have quite the same purity I guess when it comes to soluble material as commercial instant. But neither of them have quite enough coffee flavor. So I'm going to need more. So if I want nine grams, let's say, of soluble material I'm going to need to pull 90 grams of 10% espresso. That may ruin the batter, that may destroy the cake structure, it's more than I need, but it should be about 10% strength. If I've done a good job extracting it, it was just over two to one as an espresso ratio. But I would say with some confidence, we're at about 10%. And then this seems like a lot of liquid now, we'll add to this portion of the batter. So I would say the batter feels like a little bit wetter but not a lot. But I'm aware of baking is a kind of alchemy and precision is everything so I just don't know both what the additional liquid will do plus the additional acidity. Acidity does play a role in cake structure. The acidity of espresso may mess everything up. Let's find out. So I'm just gonna check the temperature at22 minutes in. 89.2 is maybe two or three degrees cooler than last time, so I'm going to let it bake for maybe another five minutes and check in, see how the temperature is then. I've gotta say, smells fantastic, but we'll let it cool down patiently. Then we'll give it taste. It's time for the final taste test and you might notice this has been a bit more depleted. It's important to do thorough testing, but let's get into the latest cake. So let me taste a benchmark, which we agreed, well, I agreed, was delicious. Still a very good cake, not too much intensity of flavor. Now this cake looks much darker. Is that from more coffee flavor I wonder? That is good, it was very good. That is so much better than I thought it was going to be. That is everything warm and comforting and friendly about coffee. Everything you want coffee to be in a sweet thing. That is delicious. That is great. I have no idea why people aren't adding well reduced espresso to this recipe. It's really good. I'm really happy with this. I think this is a really great coffee sponge to go into a coffee cake, but I can't help but wonder how could this be better? I'm at the upper limits of my skillset and my knowledge around baking. What if there's more, there has to be more. I need a smarter person than me. I need a more knowledgeable person than me, and when it comes to food and food science, I have someone mind. Now when it comes to food science and cooking no channel has had more influence on the way that I cook and think than ChefSteps. Grant Crilly is a co-founder of ChefSteps and an incredibly talented chef, and he just knows way too much about everything cake science related. So I sent him a text asking for some suggestions and he had a couple, one of which did involve sourcing flour that is banned in the EU and the UK, so I thought I'd probably pass on that. But I was intrigued by GMS, it stands for glycerol monosterate and is usually sold as a sport supplement that helps with hydration. However, commercial bakers have been using it as an emulsifier, and it's a cheap and healthy enough addition to the cake that should improve its texture. It isn't essential for the recipe if you don't want to include it, but I think it is a pretty interesting and cheap upgrade for baking at home. As you can tell from the costume change, this video has been going on for some days now. Now it's time before we do the final sponges and do that kind of final mix of the cake to talk about buttercream. Now, the original recipe that I worked from, the one from the Guardian newspaper, did the most basic form of buttercream which is just butter and powdered sugar whipped together. I don't love that. It's just me, I just find the amount of sugar you have to have to just have no kind of greasiness is just too high, it's too sweet, it's just not, it's just not what I'm into. So I'm going to go a different way, I'm going to go a Swiss merengue buttercream. And when it comes to this sort of stuff, there's no point lying, I would take all my advice from Stella parks, AKA Bravetart, so this recipe is somewhat based on her Swiss meringue buttercream. Now for the coffee flavoring in the buttercream, this was really interesting. In trying to create an ultimate recipe you have to remember that's not the most coffee flavor possible, it's the best coffee flavor possible. And in various trials it was really easy for the buttercream to just dominate the taste of the sponge. And that cake tastes delicious, it tastes interesting, it tasted good coffee. And smothering that with the buttercream wasn't success. It wasn't the ultimate, it had more coffee flavor but it wasn't the best. So here we are going to get some coffee flavor into the buttercream, but it's going to be gentle. And to do that, we're going to make coffee butter, which is not like a nut butter, we are going to infuse unsalted butter with coffee. Now I think this recipe, I'm taking it from the ChefSteps website, it might've stemmed from the time that I spent with Chris Young, a co-founder ChefSteps, when he was at Heston Bloomingdale's a fat duck lab, and we did a bunch of experiments back then on infusing coffee into oils. And the results were very interesting, you get a different kind of flavor profile from the coffee than you do infusing into water because different compounds are fat-soluble than water-soluble. So here I'm going to take 100 grams of coffee and 200 grams of butter. As for the infusion process, if you have a Sous Vide circulator, like this or any other one, you can use that and it's quite easy. We're going to infuse at 90 degrees Celsius for about an hour only. Their recipe is a three hours at 90 C, we're going to do one hour at 90 C. I just want a little bit less of an infusion here. We are going to use whole beans. And that seems insane because why would you not grind them? But I need to be able to remove every speck of coffee for this from a texture perspective. I don't want any bits in my buttercream later, so whole beans it is and the infusion works still really very well. If you don't have a circulator you can just get a pot, put the butter in it, melt it, and cook the coffee beans in the butter but be careful to keep the temperature below the point at which your moisture will start to boil out and certainly below temperatures we'd start to brown that butter. So after it's infused, be it on the pot or through a Sous Vide, you want to strain it out, and we've got some coffee infused butter. Confusingly I'm making this butter quite late in the video but in the real world if I was baking this cake this would be the first thing I would do. The reason being, I need to put this in the fridge, so it chills down again and then actually bring it out of the fridge before I use it so it's around 18 degrees Celsius. I don't want it room temp, I don't want it cold, I want it softening for the next phase. Now the rest of this recipe is pretty much from Stella Parks and it's linked down below. We're going to mix 85 grams of egg whites from two or three eggs with 155 grams of plain sugar. I'm using powdered here because I had some leftover from previous tests. Heat this in a setup until the mixture reaches 85 degrees Celsius, and then whip it on high for around 10 minutes until the meringue is a glossy and stiff and the temperature is around 32 Celsius. With the mixer running we're going to add 100 grams of coffee butter, and then 180 grams of unsalted butter, but only about a tablespoon at a time making sure it's fully incorporated in. In our case we're going to put it into a piping bag because it's time to finish the cake. It's nearly time to put together the last sort of steps, make those final sponges, and build this thing.

We've worked out what we want the ultimate coffee cake to be, the most delicious coffee flavored cake we can make. I've got my buttercream frosting done, I just need to make the two sponges. I'm just going for a two tier cake. 'Cause three can be a little bit too much. Two tiers is good, put it together and I just really want to eat it. I can't wait, let's go. So this final batch, we're making two sponges so doubling all the ingredients, but the process is the same. And we're going to add six grams of GMS. Once that's mixed in, I found the best way from here was to add about half of the espresso and then about half of the flour, then the rest of the espresso and the rest of the flour, making sure to mix on low, very gently until pretty much incorporated. Split the batter evenly between the two tins. If it helps you, you want at least 480 grams of batter in each one and then bake at 175 or 25 minutes, or until you hit that internal temperature of 96 degrees Celsius. Sponges, done, cooled. The cooler the better. If you have no patience like me, tough, try and let them cool completely and then we're going to frost them up. Now, as I said before, we want a delicate touch here. Now this is another important point, I'm not a baker of any kind. I don't know what I'm doing with frosting, I don't make beautiful looking cakes. I want delicious cakes. Now, if you're going to frosting stuff you're going to feel very superior to me in the next second. But I don't really mind too much. I don't like the idea of there being a barrier to entry, this should be fun and delicious and beautiful after that. So thin layer the frosting on here I'm going to pipe on. Second tier on top, thin layer on top. I'm going in the not generous way here and then we should have balance texture, tons of coffee flavor, I'm excited to taste what the GMs has done to the texture as well so let's get on with it. Yeah, you may mock me for my cake decorating skills in the comments, I'm actually okay with that. I think the phrase you're looking for is rustic. But it's not about the look, it's about the eating. It's time to get into this thing. It's time for the all-important taste test. I didn't garnish this because what, I'm going to put coffee beans on top? I'm not gonna lie, saying that this is the best coffee cake I've ever had clears a low bar, because historically these have never been very good. This is delicious. That coffee is clean and sweet. It tastes like good coffee went into it. There's just enough buttercream frosting just to make it a little bit softer and richer, but the sponge is the star of the show, that is a great cake. That is what you want coffee to be when it turns up in dessert, when it turns up in other things. You want coffee to show off what it's good at, not be this generic dull, slightly bitter brown taste. You want it to be the things you love about coffee and that's what this does. This tastes like good coffee, not just coffee, but it tastes like good coffee. The contrast in kind of coffee flavors between the buttercream for that kind of oil infusion of flavors and the sponge is really interesting. It's a very complete spectrum of flavor. You probably wouldn't get the nuance of an interesting coffee from Ethiopia or probably not worth putting a Gesher in here either, but something clean, sweet and delicious, espresso pulled strong, turned into a yummy cake.", "videoID": "ckQRBhTxgNA"}, {"title": "Espresso Machine Baskets Explained", "text": "Today, we're going to talk about espresso machine baskets. Why are they so important? Why are they, I think, an essential upgrade? How do you tell if yours is good or not? And how exactly do they affect the way you brew espresso. All this and more, we will answer today. Now this is kind of important. I'm going to talk today about a couple of brands that I think are good and make very good baskets. What I can't do is really know the entire state of the market, so I can't tell you who's making bad baskets necessarily or where different manufacturers are, so we're not actually going to pick on anyone necessarily today and say \"you're doing a bad job\" but like I said, we'll talk about how to literally identify a well-made basket from a badly made basket. Now, I need to do just a little bit of history because the invention of the precision basket is a relatively modern thing, go back maybe 12 years, a little bit more, it wasn't really something we thought about or worried about despite the fact that actually it was having a big impact on the way that we were making espresso. Because you've got to remember that espresso comes from Italy, it comes from 14 grams for a double and modern espresso had started using 18 20, 22, 24 grams of coffee in the same baskets. And we hadn't thought about the way that the baskets themselves were impacting the coffee we were making. Now we would have funny issues with baskets; I've seen baskets split at the bottom, I've seen badly made baskets where the flow in a two group is totally different out of one side than the other, because the baskets were inconsistent in that regard and it can make a really big difference. So it became a thing we worried about primarily due to one man, one company. That was a guy called Vince Fedele of VST who still make Precision Baskets, who also make refractometers. He had a very big impact on the industry. His background: he did I think what was ultimately Apple's first external hard drive, he has a background in technology and he'd built a 3D fingerprint scanner. And one day he put his espresso machine's basket onto his 3D fingerprint scanner and was appalled by the results. What he saw was a lack of uniformity in the holes at the bottom of the basket. Not just with the varying sizes, some weren't proper holes, there hadn't been properly machined in the first place, and then he put a different basket on and saw, even though it was the same manufacturer, it was different again. And he saw an opportunity and he started to make baskets that I think had a really really really big impact. I was, for disclosure, a beta tester of those baskets back in what would have been maybe 2010. It did result in me making one of the most satisfying espressos of my life, Tim Wendelboe, fantastic roaster from Norway, also a blunt and fussy man, and I don't think he would mind me saying that, he has strong opinions and is not afraid to share them. Well, he came to visit and I'd had some fun dialing in his espresso blend, exactly how I wanted it to. Because we were just at the beginning of understanding weight in, weight out, understanding the importance of those things. And then having this basket that let me properly extract coffee let me serve him something that he couldn't make in his shop. And he left annoyed and that made me embarrassingly delighted. But let's get into why they impact espresso and how they might make your espresso taste better. It's important to understand that when you brew espresso, the puck of coffee is doing most of the work to create resistance to the water flowing from the pump, but the basket plays a role too. It's not just total open area, it is mostly a solid surface with some very small holes scattered throughout it. That means that the basket offers some resistance. What Vince very quickly worked out was that for a fixed amount of coffee, that resistance should be kind of commensurate, it should match. So that if you were say brewing 14 grams, you might want to have more resistance from the basket than if you were brewing say 18 grams. Because if you kept the resistance the same you'd have to grind your 18 grams much much coarser to have a similar flow rate. Grinding coarser decreases your extraction, you get more acidity, you are tempted to roast darker, you get into a cycle, a kind of spiral of dark roasting under extraction that I think a lot of the industry had been in for a long time. And so Vince came along and offered a different kind of thing, and he began to produce baskets that had doses on the side. If I get one for an 18 gram basket and one for a 22 gram basket, you'll see that they're actually quite different. You get a little chart showing you the count of holes and the hole sizes that's kind of interesting, but you'll see there's a difference in the distribution between the two. So as a quick illustration of the total open area, I'll show you a kind of simple experiment. I'm going to grind about 40 grams of coffee for espresso, a little bit more than I need. I'm gonna give it a good mix up, so that for each of these two doses they're going to be using identical coffee. And I'll put 18 grams into an 18 gram basket and I'll put 18 grams into a 22 gram basket. And we'll compare the flow from each one because the 22 gram basket should have a larger open area, we should see a faster flow. Now I know there'll be some impact from there being a larger headspace in the 22 gram basket, but really we're looking at just overall flow rate, and I think it's a nice illustration of the difference you get in well-made baskets. Now this is all taken to its logical extreme by these things: pressurized portafilter baskets. They look normal on one side, but you'll typically see this just one small hole on the other side. These are there to have the basket itself, add all the resistance that's missing because you're using coarsely-ground coffee. When you use properly finely ground coffee, the basket doesn't have to add much resistance, if you're using pre-ground coffee, the basket has to do a lot more work, and so that's literally what's happening here. The basket is adding all the resistance you're missing to give you a kind of appropriate flow rate, and to let you build the kind of pressure you need to to pull out any CO2 that's in the coffee to give you some sort of crema at the end of it, so that's the extreme. And you kind of don't want too much resistance if you've got a good grinder. Now, if you're out there shopping for a basket, you've got a number of choices to make in terms of the basket that you buy. You'll see some baskets have ridges along the side here, some do not, and the difference between a ridged and ridgeless basket, isn't really in the brewing itself, It's in the wider utility of the whole thing. In an espresso machine portafilter, you'll have a little spring, like this we call it a spring, but it's just a piece of wire kind of clip that sits inside and holds the basket. If this is weak or the basket is ill-fitting the ridges there to help give you another layer of security of holding the basket in so that when you knock the puck out that the basket doesn't fall out too. In most cases, these clips are perfectly adequate to not need a ridge on the basket and having no ridge means that the puck knocks out cleaner, and that's a good thing. So I am a big fan of ridgeless baskets over ridged and I would rather change this little clip out and have a stiffer one than go to a ridged basket from a kind of workflow perspective, just because the easier, the better. Now, the other thing that obviously changes with different baskets in terms of volume is actually the literal height of the basket here. If you take an 18 gram basket and a 22 gram basket, well, one is literally taller than the other to allow more coffee in there without pressing it against the shower screen, you don't want to be mashing coffee against the shower screen that may disrupt the puck as well, so larger doses should go into larger baskets, that makes total sense. You can always underdose a basket, and the downside will generally be that the puck at the end is kind of sloppy and loose because it's had a lot of space to expand at the end of the shot. So when you finish brewing espresso in many machines, it discharges the pressure up through the group head, and that causes the puck to expand. The more space you have for expansion, the looser and wetter the puck will be afterwards. It doesn't tell you a lot more than that so from a, again, workflow perspective, I like to have a dry puck at the end because it knocks out cleanly, but if I have to drop the dose, that's fine if I could only have one basket, I would go for the largest dose I would ever want to use. I might pick a 20 gram even though I might brew 18 grams quite often, but I can't brew 20 grams very effectively, or certainly 21 in an 18 gram basket. So if you're going to pick one, go just a little bit bigger than you might need that's my kind of recommendation, but I understand that will be a little bit messier. Now, if you want to assess the basket that you have, it's kind of easy to do a very surface level assessment. The first thing you should do is literally hold it up to the light and inspect the holes. If they are inconsistent in sizing, if there are some holes that aren't completely punched through and sadly that actually does happen if they're kind of clogged or you can see the hole itself is not perfectly circular, it's kind of burred-shaped, you don't have a well-made basket. They are sadly very common, they are not doing a good job, they will age really badly, they're more likely to split those kinds of burred holes will brew kind of differently than the ones that are properly machined, it's just not recommended. Espresso is hard enough, you don't need your basket making your life harder. You can go a little further and have a little look with a microscope if you have one to hand or a magnifying glass. I think you'd be kind of surprised by what you see with a cheaper espresso machine basket and you compare that to one of the many precision baskets, and it's not just VST. I think Pullman do a nice set too, IMS makes some nice baskets, you'll really really see the difference. Now, you'll see that all of these baskets are generally straight walled baskets, and these are double baskets designed for at least 13, 14 grams of coffee to pull what is a double espresso. There are single baskets, these are difficult to work with. Generally speaking, there are much more conical shapes and they have a smaller open area at the bottom again, because you want to sort of match the resistance to having half the dose of a double basket. They are obviously a different shape generally speaking, the same dose, but cut in half won't match across to these. Rarely do you see these used in homes, but you do see them used all the time in Italy. In fact, the kind of single basket is, I feel like, used more often than not in Italy compared to the double. There are lots of different designs from manufacturers out there you'll see some that are cone-shaped like this, some that are almost little miniature straight walled sort of sections in the middle of the basket kind of dropped down, they are more difficult to prep, they're more difficult to brew evenly, they're more likely to channel or extract unevenly under most puck prep situations. And so they're a really interesting challenge if you're looking for one for espresso, if you think espresso is easy, get yourself a single basket I think that's a good challenge. Brewing better with it is maybe a different video and a different topic but you should just know about these things they're just not as easy as I wish they were, but good results are possible. You've just got to work for them that little bit harder. And so that is a very quick overview of espresso machine baskets. I would strongly recommend for just about every single machine out there buying a precision basket. It is reliable, it's well-made and it will get you better espresso because it will let you grind finer than most baskets will typically let you. That higher open area is really useful if you want to up your extraction game, especially if you're using lighter roasts or kind of trickier to extract, more complex, more interesting coffees. Don't be surprised if you switch to a precision basket and you see your flow rate suddenly increase. What was brewing at maybe 28 seconds is suddenly brewing in 17 seconds, even though you didn't change the grinder, that's pretty normal. That's the difference in the resistance from the basket that I think can be shocking for a lot of people. The end result, I think, is a sweeter more complex espresso than you would get from a cheaper basket and a more reliable result. And if you're in a cafe, then 100% precision baskets so that you know that one group is brewing identically to the other and to a third.", "videoID": "3oFV88PzEFE"}, {"title": "Coffee Review\uff1a CLR CFF - Clear Coffee\uff1f!", "text": "Hey there I thought it'd be fun today to post a little video review of something I had seen online that I bought, that was kind of interesting and it's a product called clear coffee. I Was a little skeptical. Now, I saw it online in places like Sprudge they wrote a kind of excited piece about this thing. It's based in London, so I went online. Cost me about eight pounds, nine pounds to get two bottles delivered which is expensive. And it took them about six weeks to do it. It seemed that the ... the online press had caused it to sell out pretty much immediately. So I had to wait quite a while. So this only just turned up This is interesting to me because over the years I've experimented quite a lot in trying to make clear coffee I'd done stuff like Gelatin clarifications or agar clarifications, and I had tried some low temperature low pressure distillations. Uhh, nothing either worked or tasted good at all So I was curious to see how this would taste and what kind of a thing they've done. On the back, the claims are quite serious It is 50 milligrams of caffeine per 100 mils This is a 200 mil bottle, so a hundred milligrams of caffeine is actually quite a lot of caffeine for this much liquid That's quite surprising Not suitable for pregnant women children or people sensitive to caffeine. Now, This is interesting Ingredients are water Coffee Arabica - Shouldn't it just be arabica coffee, or Coffea arabica - 6% apparently, and then some natural caffeine so they're dosing this with additional caffeine. Which is kind of interesting. So they're just saying basically water coffee and caffeine Let's have a little smell Oh that smells bad this smells kind of solvent-y. You know what I mean like like that sort of um Not quite boozy smell, but definitely like they might have used some sort of solvent. They say they don't but that's That's quite an unusual smell in terms of coffee smell rubber just burnt wood and slightly rancid smoke It's like the worst bit of Pt. Whiskies with none of the good stuff whatsoever All right, so I have I'm nervous now. Have a little advice because I figure this is probably Gonna be better cold and they make a bunch of Sort of bizarre claims that that you know this is great because it won't stain your teeth, but To be honest nearly neither would like a bottle of water and some pro plus which would be about the same, but probably tastes better That's really terrible. I don't you know I'm not Trying to pick on anyone here. That's a bad product that is not much mouth feel Not really coffee flavored to be honest like that's not coffee as I know coffee. There is no sweetness extremely, woody burnt Quite an unpleasant aftertaste particularly ashy that is It's really bad. Ah the finish is astonishing like really just a big hit of smoke in the finish and then Yeah, just like ash like a lingering ashy-ness here. I don't actually know how they've made this my guess from how it smells and tastes is that they have done some sort of Solvent based extraction, I don't know what they might have used I mean Maybe it's just water and then they've done something like rotovap it. where you, you pull a vacuum or a partial vacuum, so that things boil at a lower temperature And then you distill them that way. My experience with rotovap and coffee has been pretty terrible Though I hadn't used coffee apparently roasted this dark, and it's kind of fascinating to get the really roasty bitter Like Super Dark roast Flavors with no good coffee Flavor whatsoever in this thing.", "videoID": "2uhjHHPd_Rw"}, {"title": "The Truth About V60 Filter Papers", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about the V60 filters. Now there's been a little bit of talk online about the various different filters out there. I thought I would just do a quick video to explain exactly what the differences are with the three different types of V60 filters you can currently buy, all Hario brand. We're gonna brew them. See if there's any real differences there maybe taste them too. That'll make sense, I promise. So right now there are three different types of filters that you can buy. You can get the boxed filters, right? Which are typically available only in forties. For the bleach filters, you can still get hundreds of the unbleached. These are the original, right? These are the ones made by the original factory in Japan. Not so long ago these came out, which are the kind of the loud crinkly pouch. So these are the kinds of loose packed filters. These are also made in Japan but in a different factory, they're in a new factory. So these have been around for a little while. Most recently you've seen these, the sort of shrink wrapped type of packs of a hundred. Now these are actually made in Europe, they're made in the Netherlands. So these are probably the kind of newest filters out there and they're all a little bit different. So let's look in a little bit more detail into how they're different. So open them up. Okay, so there's three filters and they do feel really quite different which is interesting. The original filter has no tab. The other two have little convenience tabs to help you open and separate the filter out. The original does not have that. The most recent ones, the ones from Europe also have V60 D embossed on them. Now as a paper they feel really different to the other two which feel a little closer in texture. The original feels softer almost as a texture and it looks reasonably similar to the other Japanese paper but the newer one definitely looks a lot different. So what I wanna do really as the first test is I'm gonna brew each filter, same conditions. We're gonna do a really simple pour of a technique. There's gonna be a stirred bloom and then we're gonna get the water in as quickly as possible, a stir for the draw down and that's it. Just so we can see the influence and impact of the paper on brew time, which I think is gonna be really, really interesting. Different thicknesses of paper, they're gonna swell different ways. Those fibers are gonna kind of add a little bit of resistance to the brew, potentially. I don't know exactly how they're gonna brew but it should be an interesting little test. So I'm gonna brew 30 grams to 500 of water and I will just do that three times and see the difference. I'll say that's done at 2:20. I'll call that done at 2:35. I'll call that done at 3:10. So the next part of the test that I wanted to do was trying to understand if the papers were bringing any kind of taste to play in a cup of coffee. Now everyone rinses their papers, or at least I hope they do, but I thought it would be fun to do a quick experiment. Years ago, I wrote a piece for a magazine called Longberry, where I tasted a whole host of different filter papers. And all I did was this, I steeped them in a hot water and then tasted the results and it was really surprising how different they were. So that's exactly what I've done here with the three papers, with the original Japanese paper, with the other, the second Japanese factory, and then the Dutch factory over here. So I'm kind of curious just to taste, these have been sitting for about 10 minutes infusing now, whether there's any difference. So, you know, wish me luck. It's kind of a little bit sweet. Kind of reminds me a little bit of like chewing a pencil that kind of taste, not surprisingly. Let's go for this one here. Oh different, really different, not unpleasant actually but less the kind of slightly artificial sweet much more of a kind of... A much more kind of just straight cardboardy of flavor, I guess a little bit. But really actually no, really very neutral. I actually believe, you know, really very little flavor coming out of this. Oh, oh, that is very different. That is not entirely unpleasant. It's bleached filter after all but it definitely has a much more distinct taste. Kind of almost tiny bit, kind of chemically, kind of bit leathery almost really, really drastically different. Okay, let's wrap this all up into some results. Coming into this, I'd heard people having very, very, very different experiences, quite dramatically different brews with the different papers. And so it was interesting to do a test to verify that. Now, you know, I don't think the two papers from Japan brewed dramatically different. There was a small variance in time but not something that you would really be worrying about a great deal or maybe worrying about changing a grind setting for, and they were both pretty neutral tasting The papers here, they did brew pretty differently like really surprisingly differently to me. Especially because this felt like a thinner piece of paper not like say a Chemex filter, which feels really, really thick. This felt quite the opposite, quite thin. I wonder whether it swells more dramatically in contact with water just providing that little bit of extra resistance. I don't really necessarily understand why it's doing what it's doing but it's definitely notable. And it does taste a little bit different. Their original filters are only available right now in packs of 40. And that does mean that you're gonna pay a premium if you really do want the original filters. They're definitely available, they're out there, but you are gonna pay more and I'm not necessarily sure that they're worth that much more than the other filters that you can quite easily get that are made in Japan. I'm not saying you should avoid the papers made in Holland. Maybe you like them, maybe they brew better for you. I'm not saying that one is dramatically better than the other but certainly if you're having issues with this paper it might be worth tracking down one of these two.", "videoID": "0uggibTY0AE"}, {"title": "Review\uff1a Fellow Prismo Vs Cafflano Kompresso", "text": "Hi, welcome, today we're gonna do something a little different. Recently, I have reviewed a couple of lever manual espresso machines, the Flair and the Rok and I've got two other kinds of manual espresso makers, but they're a little bit different. They're both claiming to do something like espresso but they're kind of direct pressure, there's not lever involved. Now this immediately rules out any real high pressures. There's only so much pressure you can apply with your hands or your body, compared to an espresso machine or a lever. Nine bars of pressure is 130 pounds of force per square inch. So to exert that kind of force by hand, that's just not going to happen. So I have two different products to review. I have the Cafflano Kompresso, which is a little handheld thing. And then also the Fellow Products Prismo which is an attachment designed to go onto an AeroPress. So this is just a little simple thing, this is an entire brewer. And they're both going to try and do the same thing. Now we'll start, we'll start with the Fellow, the Fellow Prismo. It's a pretty neat idea, but it's not a new idea. When I first got into selling espresso machines, that was in the early 2000s, for domestic machines, you would get this thing called the kind of crema disc, or kind of pressurized portafilters. And they were little tiny discs that sat underneath the basket that only really let espresso flow through when the basket had reached a certain pressure. This meant that if you put your pre-ground, quite coarse, supermarket coffee in there, you would still get a build up of pressure, despite the fact that usually, the machine would just blow right through that. So you'd get this kind of weird espresso out of it, but you'd get quite a lot of crema. This is a very similar idea. In this you get two things. You get the attachment that has the little valve in it that will open at a certain pressure. And you also get a little metal filter plate. This is because if you use paper, you really won't get any crema. For that kind of good looking espresso-y thing, metal is your friend. So this pops in here, you click it to the bottom of an AeroPress, and you brew some coffee. Now we'll unbox the other one while we're here. A little bit more stuff inside this one. We'll get to instructions, but you know. Okay, so the Kompresso is obviously designed as a kind of travel option, it all kind of clicks together quite neatly, and there are several pieces to this. So you've got your main top plunger that's going to do your pressing. You've got a kind of brewing chamber that has a little shower screen at the bottom. Your coffee's going to go in here, and again, metal filtered. And then you've got a little tamper and then I suppose I'm drinking I'm drinking from this, maybe. As we talked about to get real high pressures, if that's distributed over a large surface area, a large number of square inches, to build the pounds per square inch is very difficult. Here, you've got a pretty narrow chamber so that may allow a sort of better conversion of force to pressure inside the brewing chamber. A note on crema. People in coffee talk like crema is some sort of magical thing. It's really not. It's no different to head on a beer. When you roast coffee, one of the byproducts is CO2. A lot of that remains trapped inside the grounds even after they're ground. And you'll see that when coffee blooms, or when you pour shots of espresso, you get a foam. And what's happened is that water under pressure is able to absorb way more CO2 than it usually can. And when it gets back to being at atmospheric pressure, it can't keep hold of it anymore and that CO2 comes out of solution and then in the case of coffee, gets trapped in the coffee as a foam. Coffee contains surfactants, which is sort of short for surface active agents, or simply put a kind of foaming agent, something that will wrap itself around a bubble to make it strong and stable. Today we're not really going to get into definitions of what is espresso. Is it something brewed at very high pressure? And what is high pressure? Is it five bars? Six bars? Seven? Is it short? Is it big? Is a lungo still espresso? What is what? That's not for now. That's not for today. We're going to brew these things as they suggest we brew them. I'm going to taste them and we're going to see what's good, what's fun, what's nice, what's recommended. Which one is better? Let the competition begin. So I have my handy AeroPress. I only need these two pieces because obviously I need the plunger, but I'm going to attach the Prismo to the bottom of my AeroPress, which is a little bit stiff, but I suppose that's good if we're going to be pushing at high pressure. Now they want me to put in 20 grams of ultra-fine coffee. I don't know what that is but we'll get there. 50 grams of water. 10 second agitation and then a minutes steep and then press. So I have my boiling water. Now usually it would seem foolish to pour on an AeroPress just on a set of scales. You'd want it on its brewing vessel already. But I'm going to trust the product. It shouldn't open because of that valve at the bottom. So 50 mils. Doesn't seem like much. 10 seconds of agitation. It would seem foolish to pour on an AeroPress just on a set of scales. I hadn't really thought about that that putting a plunger on top does apply pressure. Clearly enough pressure to open the valve. That doesn't seem ideal. Let's start over. I return with fresh water and a lesson learned. Don't be cocky. 50 mils again. 10 seconds of agitation. We're all agitated appropriately. The vaguest wisps, wisps of foam. Flavor wise it's not bad actually. It's a little strong for me actually in some ways. I generally would prefer a bigger espresso. So I might do better putting maybe 60, maybe even 70 mils of water into this thing. Because your yield out of this is not very much if you're putting 50 mils in. It's reasonably well extracted. It tastes okay, there's no crema, but that's not a problem for me. I don't mind. Also worth considering is the fact that this is designed to be a little more multi-use. It would let you brew a regular style AeroPress with a metal filter, but you wouldn't have to invert to prevent the brew from starting because the valve at the bottom would do that for you. So you can brew a regular AeroPress with this thing. It would be useful. They talk about like cold brew and iced teas. I'm not blown away, but interesting. I feel like a few more shots I might get something good, but just for a first run comparison, let's turn our attention to our friend the Kompresso. Let's see if they give me a recommendation for the amount of coffee I should use. So recipe wise, this seems much more sensible. They're going to go with 10 to 15 grams and then somewhere between 30 and 60 mils of water. So we're not going to get the same kind of recipe that we did from the Prismo for a side-by-side comparison. So let's do maybe 15 grams to 60 grams of water. Turns out no, we're going to be doing about 12 grams. Now this does come with a little tamper-type thing. Let's just move you. Man, is that branded? Go together with you. Let's just clean up a little here. Now I may have to get out of the chair for this one. So we're going to go going to go that full 60 mils. Feeling it. So this is much closer to espresso in that there's kind of a pre-infusion phase. And then a straight kind of percolation phase. It says five seconds or so, let it pre-infuse. Squeeze. So we've got, like, an amount of liquid that is not seemingly that interested in passing through the coffee. So this is too small. This is not a success. Oh! That's you're classic - ugh! Way too short. Right, like that's woefully under extracted in comparison to the first shot of the Prismo. I definitely need to get more of the water through the coffee. Let's brew again. Second chance time. Well, second attempt. Let's not make it that harsh. So five, six seconds of pre-infusion. A little plunger. I should be using the proper technique. That looks better. Pretty much all of the liquid went through. That's good. I don't love this as a drinking vessel. I think I'm not entirely dialed in on the grind, I think I could go just a touch finer again and I'd be pretty close to well extracted actually. Again, about 12 grams of coffee in the basket. 60 mils of water. Seems like a kind of big ratio, you know like a long shot, but not everything gets pressed through and I think you do need as much liquid as you can in these types of set ups to do as much extraction as you can. So this is, this is okay, and I think it would be very easily a little bit better. Hm. All right I'm going to pull a few more shots on each, a few more brews and then I'll come back to you in a second. So time for final thoughts on these two things. And I've brewed a little bit more with them and I've thought a little bit more about them. And here's my summary. Neither of them are making anything that is really that close to something from either a proper espresso machine or a lever espresso machine, be it manual or not. They're not really achieving super high pressure. I know that the Cafflano Kompresso claims to hit some high pressures, but I'd be interested to see their maths on that one. And it doesn't taste like, it doesn't look like it. Neither of them. Now, the Fellow, it's really not brewing anything that I would call espresso. And they call it espresso-like and I think that's pretty fair. I don't think you're getting that close. It is, it is a much more flexible product, it does more. You could argue this is a little bit more of a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none, where this is really just going much deeper on trying to do espresso. Right, here, this is a nice little hack for an AeroPress to have a couple of bonus features, but it's not making espresso. This thing is getting much closer. The pressures are going to be higher. It's more like a peculation where a column of water passes through a puck of ground coffee. It's neat. It's got quite a few pieces, but they fit together quite well. It's easy enough to clean. It makes better espresso-like coffee, to me. So if all you wanted was something that did something close to espresso that you just use your hands, this. Like it's light, it's durable, it'll travel well. You'll get pretty close to espresso-like. This is probably a more useful product for a whole bunch of different things. If you like AeroPress coffee and if you like metal filtered AeroPress coffee in particular, this is probably a nice little add-on. I don't really like metal filters myself, I always prefer paper filters, especially in the AeroPress. But that doesn't mean everyone agrees with me. In fact, lots of people like metal filters. There's a good argument in terms of sustainability, in terms of having something reusable. So if you've got an AeroPress and you want to one, have no drips until you press and two, you want to get into using less paper, this is maybe an option. If you want travel espresso on-the-go, probably this. I'm not going to keep either of these. I'm going to give them both away. If I got to keep one of them, I would probably keep this, just for those rare moments where I might want something more espresso-like. Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of metal filtered AeroPress coffee. That's just me. Now the reason I'm not keeping them is I'm giving them both away to Patreon backers. So I've started a Patreon where your contributions fund me buying things to review so there's no influence from manufacturers, there's no bias in there. And at the end of the review, well I give the products away back to the community that supported them. So the two winners of these products is Erica Walren, Valren, Walren. And Ethan Anderson. I haven't decided whose getting what yet, but you'll get some packages in the mail soon. I'll drop you an email for your addresses. If you want to have influence over what I review, if you want to be a part of that community and potentially end up with one of these things or something else at the end of it, then I would appreciate your support. If you don't want to support, that's okay. Videos will still be on this channel. They'll still be here. There'll still be a wide range of topics, but if you want to get involved, join a conversation that we're having over there, join that community, I'd love to see you.", "videoID": "JZ--RnK81DQ"}, {"title": "Steam Wand Scrambled Eggs", "text": "Today, we're gonna talk about steam wand eggs. Now, wait, wait, don't click the dislike button just yet. Just wait, just wait a second. Now this starts in my subreddit where someone links a video with a little title, which is, \"Hoffmann, react to this atrocity.\" And the video, well we're gonna watch it together and decide if it's atrocious and decide if there's anything interesting there. So it's Martha Stewart's famous eggs. Let's see, let's see how this goes. - Here's a very fun way to cook scrambled eggs, with a cappuccino machine. - It is not, it is not a cappuccino machine, please stop calling it that. I know it can make a cappuccino, but it's not a cappuccino machine. You know, it's not a latte machine, a flat white machine, it's not an Americano machine, it's an espresso machine. Stop it, people out there who call it a cappuccino machine, that's naughty and wrong. -  Break up the eggs, a little salt, a little pepper, and about a tea- - I'm not against handling fridge cold butter, that just doesn't look like fridge cold butter, that looks like room temperature, squishy butter. That's just kind of, that's kind of grossed me out in a weird sort of way. I don't know why, let's carry on. - And a teaspoon and a half of butter. And now insert the steam wand. - Did she start steaming before putting it inside? That just seems ambitious and foolish, and don't, don't do that. - Right into the scrambled eggs. It steams the eggs into the softest, fluffiest scrambled eggs, and in just a minute- - I have to ask, Martha, why are you steaming this in one of the latte glasses that no one's used since 1992? That, I just don't get it, why would you choose to steam inside a glass? That's the weirdest choice. There's a lot of egg on that wand right now. That doesn't bode well. -  In just a matter of seconds, your eggs are finished. Mix it all up together. And then if you have it in a- - Is that dry toast? Who'd? Is that dry toast? It's barely toasted and it's dry toast. That is not acceptable. - Nice piece of toasted bread. You can put piece of Swiss cheese or Gruyere right on the bread if you like. These eggs are buttery and- - Oh. Oh, Martha. Look at the steam wand. Look at the steam wand, that is unacceptable. If you, that is just disgusting. Don't, don't do that. That is the Cardinal sin of all of this, which is look at the filthy egg she's just left cooking onto that wand. That wand is gonna be hot, it's gonna keep kind of cooking the egg around it, it's really gonna stick. That is not cool. And you know someone else is gonna have to clean that up for her, cause she's not cleaning that wand. - Fluffy, and light, and delicious. So very, very easy. And it is a conversation piece in your kitchen too. Scrambled eggs, \u00e0-la-cappuccino-machine. - That is the worst name for these that I've ever heard. So I'm reasonably horrified by this video, primarily because of the state of the steam wand at the end of that, that is deeply unacceptable. Now this isn't the first time I've seen scrambled eggs with a coffee machine steam wand, that this has been around decades, decades, and decades in fact. I've done it in the past as well, just out of curiosity to see what it was like. Now I'd kind of written this whole thing off, but I remember seeing, a little while ago, a video from someone who knows food, who knows cooking, which is J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt. You'll probably know him from \"Serious Eats\", from his YouTube channel. He knows eggs, he knows cooking. Kenji had made a video about this when he was in Columbia, and it was called \"Things Worth Eating, Huevos Al Vapor\", and it looks tasty, also kind of weird though. Let's just see what he has to say on the subject. - I'm here today at Cafe El Polo, in Salamina, Colombia, and I'm eating this thing called huevos al vapor. It's steamed eggs, so these are eggs that are actually cooked using an espresso machine with a- - Okay, so they're cooking it in the cup, which again, I don't know what the thing is about cooking them in glasses or cups, or just things you don't usually cook eggs in, but okay. -  'Cause they take the eggs, they put them in a cup with some butter and a little bit of salt, and then they put it right underneath the wand of the espresso machine and the steam kind of bubbles them and cooks them, keeps them nice and moist. They're basically like the moistest- - I hope he cleans that wand. Now the wand as a whole, looks relatively clean, but you can see there's a lot of egg stuck to that wand. And I respect the skill of keeping the eggs in the cup, despite the fact that they look like they're about to just massively overflow out the top. - Hard scrambled eggs you can get. Generally, I like my scrambled eggs a little bit runny, but these ones, they managed to be fully scrambled and hard, yet still extremely moist and creamy. - Okay, so that's really the bit that's interesting to me. If someone like, you know, Kenji notices that with a kind of fully set up eggs, sort of hardened, fully scrambled eggs, there's a textual benefit to doing it this way, that seems worth testing. You know, if I cook a kind of more cooked sort of set up scrambled egg in a pan and I compare it to egg steamed on a steam wand, will there be a benefit? Will there be a difference? Will it be negligible? There's really just one way to find out. So let's cook some eggs. Now I'll say right at the start, there is not a machine manufacturer in the world who would tell you this is a good idea. They will all be horrified at what I'm gonna do now, and for good reason. There is a potential for damaging or causing issues with your coffee machine, there's a bigger potential for being really disgusting, but that's by the by. So just know that you're doing this, if you choose to do this, at your own risk. I know I'm doing it at my own risk, I'm comfortable fixing these things, I'm comfortable incurring the cost of breaking these things if I do this by cooking some eggs. That's it, the little caveat, that little warning at the start, just be aware. So I wanna start by just cooking some eggs and tasting them. Did they taste good? Did they taste weird? What's going on? So I'll do it \u00e0-la-Martha-Stewart. I'll scramble two eggs, throw in some butter, some salt. I know salt is contentious when you salt eggs for scrambling, for now, we're just gonna go salt at the start, don't get mad, and cook them down and see what they taste like. So we're ready to steam them, I'm gonna steam them on my Eagle One PRIMA, which again, will horrify many people, probably including Victoria Arduino themselves. So, sorry. I've got my cloth ready for cleaning, that's gonna be the most important thing. Let's see how we go. I'm weirdly nervous. Oh dear. So, points for speed. That was very quick to cook. You could tell when you were getting solid curds. when you start to get that kind of eruption of steam coming out, and at that point you would expect that things are pretty well cooked, but are they delicious? I will say I do have some pretty big curds here, but this is still softly scrambled, but it doesn't look bad. Oh yeah, that's pretty good. So this is a pretty soft scramble, but I know what Kenji said was that for a harder setup, for a harder scrambled egg, it was surprisingly moist, compared to how they might be from a pan. And that's the test that I wanna do next. So I'll cook the eggs in the pan, same recipe, same amount of butter, same salt, the whole deal. To the 0.1 of a gram, of course, and then I'll cook them on here. We'll get them on some toast, and we'll see if there's any difference. So to try and make this a good head-to-head, I'm gonna cook the eggs in the pan first. They might get a little over cooked, but we're going for a harder scramble so it shouldn't really matter too much. I've got my buttered toast here, ready to roll. So as soon as this is cooked, I'll put a little on the toast, I'll put a little into a bowl so I can do a kind of simple head-to-head, and then immediately I'll steam some eggs on the steam wand and do the same thing, and we should be ready to compare and contrast. I will say, if you've never used a coffee grinder as a pepper grinder, it's a delight, it makes you realize how terrible most pepper grinders are. Like the output is fantastic. I'll just leave these un-peppered for more flavor clarity. Now the pan eggs were stirred a lot more frequently, so the curd, the clumps, are much smaller in here. You can sort of see it's cooked fully, it's fully set up, but the curds are much, much smaller. The steam wand eggs though, much bigger kind of curds of egg from the way that it was cooked. And that's kind of interesting from a textual perspective, I guess, but let's have a little taste. Eggs, they're good. The steam wand eggs, looking a little hot, to be honest. Oh, I'm not sure I expected that. It is very soft for eggs this cooked. That is true, Kenji, you were right. There is definitely something charming about that texture. In a head-to-head against a more kind of pan scrambled affair, and I don't know why, you know, I don't imagine there's foaming happening in a meaningful way when you're steaming eggs, but there's a difference. But can you tell, if you're having breakfast, you got a piece of nice toast, can you tell the difference, is really the question for me? So, let's answer that. Good, delicious, enjoyable. Honestly, by the time there is a crunchy piece of bread involved, texture is so obscured. You really can't tell the difference between these two methods of egg cooking once you've plated it up and, you know, got some crunchy sourdough underneath. If you were just eating them as scrambled eggs, yeah, you can tell the difference, and it's quite a big difference. But I guess it depends why you scramble your eggs and how you usually eat your scrambled eggs. I like mine on toast. Now let's answer the question, should you be steaming eggs with an espresso machine? And the answer is probably not. And even though I liked the texture of the eggs that came off really a lot, even when they were cooked up a little bit more, I still probably prefer the texture of a soft scrambled egg, which is closer to what it tasted like than a harder scrambled egg. And if you like the texture of hard scrambled egg, maybe you wouldn't like the texture of steamed eggs 'cause they are that little bit softer and kind of creamier tasting. I will say that steaming eggs on a machine is incredibly stressful. One, because you feel like it could all go somehow horribly wrong. Two, as they begin to cook, they get a little bit spitty and kind of angry. And three, accuracy of cooking on this is very difficult. The margin of error in cooking eggs in a pan is relatively wide, but not super wide, and it's easily missed by many people. The window here, the margin of error is tiny, it's seconds between cooked nicely, over cooked, weird. I don't know. I can't, in good conscience, tell you to use a machine in a way that it was not designed. I don't think there's an obvious way you could damage your machine by doing this, other than leaving some cooked egg on your steam wand and that's just really gross. That's just disgusting, don't do that. If you try it, clean very well, purge afterwards a lot, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it. And certainly if you eat your eggs on toast, uh, it's just not worth the effort. If somehow you could make toast but you couldn't heat a pan, but you had an espresso machine, yeah, I guess maybe. Now I'll throw in one more thought that I had, which was, could you do poached scrambled eggs? If you've not heard of that, don't be surprised. I think it comes out of a restaurant called Coi, in San Francisco, in 2007. The idea is you basically whisk together your eggs as usual, and then you boil up a pot of boiling water, get a little bit of a vortex going, and drizzle them in slowly and just let them cook. And then you can get kind of an interesting omelette or scrambled texture from this. It's very light, it's very delicate. I tried doing it here with a steam pitcher, and I steamed that pitcher up to boiling point and got a vortex going in it, but it seemed to just drop in temperature too quickly that I couldn't get a good texture on the egg that I put in there.", "videoID": "vnfxk_slKIk"}, {"title": "The Ultimate Grinder Showdown Finale (Episode #6)", "text": "Welcome to the ultimate grinder showdown Here we're going to take five of the most sought after grinders for the home and pit them head to head in a battle to the death? Maybe not the death, but they're going to battle it out to see which is the best or, ultimately, which one I would recommend to you. Now, I've made a video on each of these different grinders already. If you want to check that, there's links in the description. There's a little playlist up here as well if you just want to watch those before we get stuck in. They'll give you more info on the grinders, their backgrounds, some of the technical details behind them But to refresh your memory, starting over here we have the Lagom P-64, 64mm burrs of variable RPM. We've got the Weber Workshops EG-1, 80mm burrs, variable RPM. We've got the Monolith Flat Max by KafaTek, 98mm burrs, variable RPM. The Levercraft Ultra, 98mm burrs, variable RPM, and on the end, the Mahlko\u00f6nig EK-43S, 98mm burrs but fixed speed motor. We're gonna put them through a battery of tests and some will be subjective, that'll involve me tasting and telling you what I think, and some will be objective, things around retention and other kinds of performance too. We're gonna start off with some espresso tasting. First of all, I'm going to be pulling shots of all of these and I'll try and talk to you about how they taste different. Which ones I like more than others. I'll explain a bit more about that in a second. Then to give my palate a little bit of a break we'll do some objective testing. We'll do retention, and I've got a couple of interesting tests there. Then we'll do some filter coffee testing where we'll do both pour over and immersion brews to see how they perform within that kind of sphere of coffee brewing, and then finally, a few more little objective tests around speed and noise and that kind of stuff, and then I'll wrap up and give you my recommendations. So now, I'm gonna dial all of these in. I'm going to dial them all in on a flat nine bar profile with this machine. We'll use a different profile afterwards with a different machine. I'm gonna pull shots with each one and I'll tell you how those shots taste. Now, it won't be a blind test today, so understand that now. I actually wanna bring in my experience over the last couple of months with these grinders tasting coffee, tasting shots, when I talk about how the espressos taste. Otherwise, evaluating an entire grinder on a single shot of espresso is a little bit silly and redundant, but if I'm talking about that espresso and bringing in my experience with the grinder I hope I can give you a little bit more information. Let's dial in now. We're gonna be doing an 18 gram dose in, we're gonna be doing a 40 gram dose out. Slightly longer than two to one. Should be a fairly level playing field for all the grinders. Now when I'm tasting these, I'm going to be stirring them, sipping them and spitting them out again and rinsing aggressively to try and keep my palate going through this tasting. I'll also give you a score across a number of factors like sweetness, clarity, and texture and maybe an overall score. These aren't particularly meaningful, I'm just trying to communicate to you how the shots are different with some pretty simple numbers. I'll use some descriptors too but I won't wax lyrical about each of the shots because you're not tasting what I'm tasting, and I'm just trying to communicate to you what the espresso is like. Now time for the first shot from the Lagom P-64, from Option-O. This espresso has nice texture. I would score it maybe an eight out of ten for texture. Sweetness is pleasant, but probably a seven. I know that this probably could have a little bit more sweetness but it's pretty well extracted. I would say a seven again for balance. This is very enjoyable espresso so don't, don't get me wrong a ten across the board would be a life-changing kind of thing here. So it's nicely textured, it's nicely extracted. I feel it's got a little bit more that it could give but it is still a balanced, enjoyable shot. Very nice finish. So overall probably, probably like a seven, seven and a half. It's a very nice shot of espresso. Let's move on. Espresso from the EG-1. Texture is very nice. It feels textured and balanced and full and rich, enjoyable there, I'd probably give that an eight. Sweetness again, it is clean, it is pronounced. It is a kind of eight out of ten for sweetness, quite enjoyable. Balance again, probably an eight. This is a very enjoyable shot. It's performing very well here. It lacks a little bit for clarity, but not a huge amount but if I was to pick it apart that would be where I'd be like... a little fussier there, but overall, a very enjoyable shot eight out of ten. Definitely enjoy this really a lot. So the Monolith Max, what you notice up front here is sweetness, actually. This is quite a strong, intense sweetness. It's very pleasant. I'm gonna say eight and a half, nine for sweet. Like really nice sweetness in this espresso. Clarity is also pretty good, kind of an eight. Texture, probably a seven. It's pleasant, it's just not as full as the previous two shots. Its concentration feels high, its extraction feels quite high. It is a very very enjoyable espresso shot for me. It's like an eight, eight and a half overall. That sweetness really does appeal to me. It's very nicely extracted. Yeah, this is delicious, very good espresso. Levercraft Ultra, interesting little shot. Sweetness very nice, quite present, quite strong sweetness. Probably an eight for sweetness. I would say the texture is a little lighter here. This feels more of a unimodal style espresso where you have just a little less texture for your extraction. Probably would say seven for the texture. Balance, clarity are really there, kind of like a, kind of a nine in that regard, like tons of clarity. Really quite a balanced shot, nice finish but just missing that texture. Overall, it's an eight. It's a very good shot but I would want to just a touch more texture in those espressos, but tons of clarity. EK-43 shot. That is a tasty espresso. It doesn't have a super pronounced sweetness. I would say a solid eight there. It has nice texture I would say another eight there. It has nice clarity. It's another eight there. It's a good all around a shot that has enough texture to not feel like it's a super, super linear espresso. You'll hear me use the word unimodal a lot today I suspect and that's a grind distribution thing where there's a peak of particle sizes and there aren't tons of fines, there aren't tons of boulders. Most things are, are one size and that's considered in many cases highly desirable but with espresso, it is more complicated. That, though, is a nice espresso. It's kind of like a straight eights kind of shot. So, very tasty, very tasty indeed. Now as a kind of interlude between this round of testing and the next, it seemed appropriate to bring in some sort of benchmark. A grinder I've talked about before and that is the much, much, much cheaper conical bird niche grinder. This is \u00a3500, a third of the price pretty much, of the cheapest one the grinders that I'm testing. It's conical burr, all the others off flat. So, for the money, how big is the difference? There's a couple of things that spring to mind here. Firstly, this is just a little less extracted tasting than the others there. It has a little bit more acidity, a little bit more harshness compared to the others. It's not a bad shot. I'm not saying it doesn't taste good, I'm just saying the others have initially a little bit more extraction and therefore a little bit more balance. If I was to rate this for balance, I would say something like a six. In terms of sweetness, six to seven. It has some sweetness. It's quite nice in terms of texture. Yeah, probably like a seven again. In terms of clarity, that's again where it falls down in comparison to some of these grinders here. These very large flat burrs seem to just give you, just that, that extra nudge more clarity, and by clarity, it's a tricky word, I mean, it's easier to pick apart flavors. There's a kind of comparative muddiness to this compared to the others. It's still a nice shot. It's still an enjoyable shot and by saying it's a six out of ten that feels harsh in comparison to some of the other stuff but it's up against some of the best grinders in the world that have scored sevens and eights here, and again, I do just want to clarify these numbers are completely arbitrary, right? I'm just trying to communicate differences with numbers as a communication tool. They don't mean anything, it's not something worth like sticking in front of this grinder. This is a six out of ten shot grinder. That makes no sense whatsoever, I'm just trying to communicate differences to you. Now, let's get on with pulling some interesting shots. With the Decent, we're going to run some interesting longer profiles that have much longer pre-infusion. They're going to push these grinders into a finer place and see what happens if we just brew a different style of espresso. So what we're using is a slightly tweaked version of the cremina profile on the Decent that involves a very long pre-infusion, kind of a soaking phase, and then it ramps up a little bit and then slowly ramps down again. Mimicking a long pre-infusion run on lever a machine, and it pushes you to grind much finer. The total shot time is around 48 to 50 seconds for that same 18 in and 40 out. Instead of going through shot by shot again and taking a really long time, I'm going to do that quick tasting of the five espressos back-to-back and I'll give you a quick summary at the end of it, of some differences and things that I found that were interesting. So having tasted a bunch more espresso I kind of feel like nothing I tasted particularly changed my mind about how I felt about these grinders to start with. The world of of espresso, once you factor in stuff like changing profiles of pressure or flow, it just becomes expensive and huge. These are all incredibly capable grinders. They do produce different styles of espresso and I stand behind how I've sort of described them to date and that has kind of been a summary of my experience over the last couple of months using them every day here in the studio. When it comes to choosing a grinder based on taste, know that with all of these grinders, you can change the burr sets out and with that will come enormous change and so that's why it's been important to me in the other reviews to talk about workflow and, and those kinds of aspects. We'll now move into two rounds of retention testing. Here, in the first round, we're going to do a simple experiment. We're going to have pre-weigh out three doses of coffee at 18 grams exactly and we're going to grind them and see what comes out each time. With each of the grinders, we'll go with their recommended workflows in terms of using bellows, if they come with bellows. Removing magnetic funnels and and sweeping them out, all that kind of stuff just to see how they do. These are all single dose grinders and what you really want to see is if you put 18 grams in, you really want 18 grams out. So I'll be back in a second to tell you the results of that test and also tell you about the second retention test. So I'm looking at the results here and it was an interesting test. The grinders that did the best were the ones that you could almost take to pieces to completely sweep out. Both the Ultra and of the Monolith Max did incredibly well. Across the board the grinders did very well. The variance of about 0.1 of a gram I think is beyond acceptable in these kinds of scenarios. The EK did have a little bit of a tricky time where it seemed to, sort of retain a chunk of coffee, 0.3 of a gram, one time that kind of came out into the next one, which gave it a much larger variation in its sort of dose to dose and that can happen, you know. Getting everything out of the EK is a little trickier. I will say points to the EG-1 here. There was no process to go through. There were no bellows, there was no dissembling of anything. There was no ritual to go through, it just spat out pretty much what you put in and the sweeper system inside that grinder is very effective so points there. Now the second retention test is a little bit different because I want to look at the idea of exchange a little bit more. What exactly is being retained? And how much is kind of being exchanged, you know? Is some coffee always retained, but you know, the old coffee gets pushed out by the new, but then some you know, new coffee becomes the old coffee trapped inside. So to test that, I have, I hope a very simple test. All the grinders will be dialed in for espresso and they'll pull a shot and we'll just log that shot time, then we'll move them all to approximately, like a V60 setting and grind through 20 grams of coffee, then we'll pull them back to their grind setting for espresso and pull a shot. If they have no exchange going on, if nothing is really retained meaningfully, they should pull a very normal espresso shot straight away. If they are retaining and exchanging some coffee, that next shot of espresso will have some of that coarser grind in it and I would expect the grinders to produce a kind of faster flowing espresso if they have a higher quantity of coffee exchanging whenever you grind. So I hope that retention test makes sense. Let's see what the results are. Now I will put the result of this test up on screen so you can see what I'm talking about and I'll try and make sense of these results. I think they're very insightful and they do correlate with the retention test that we did first. Looking through at the first couple of grinders, the P-64 and the EG-1, both of them, after they'd had a, sort of a session of coarse grinding, the next shot was a little bit faster and the shot after that went back to a normal speed again. That indicated that there was a little bit of coffee retained inside the grinder at that coarse a grind that sort of needed to be worked out. That means I would recommend purging a small amount when making large changes with these grinders. The next two, the Monolith Max and the Levercraft Ultra both did really, really well on this test and again, they were the, the best performing on the retention perspective as well. Now it might look like the Max initially it didn't do that well. The first shot was 30 seconds, then we coarsely ground coffee and then the next shot was 27 seconds. But the shot after that was also 27 seconds, indicating that I might've just moved the grinder to not quite a fine enough position. I thought I'd got it right but I could have made a mistake there, and the fact that those two shots ran identically one after the other indicates that there really wasn't any coarsely ground coffee left behind from that coarser grinding session. It had all been gotten rid of. The worst performer here by far was the EK-43S. The retention on the first test wasn't very good and the retention on this test certainly wasn't very good. That shot after we coarsely ground some coffee and moved it back to position ran really, really fast, and the shot after that, same position, got back to a nearly normal flow rate again. So, clearly there was coarser ground coffee retained inside it. So yeah, if you're making big changes with an EK I would also recommend purging a small amount of coffee through that grinder. Might only need to be three, four, five grams but something should go through just to make sure that you're exchanging any of that sort of coarsely ground coffee for some finer ground coffee. So that's it for espresso testing for now. We're going to look at some filter coffee. We're gonna look at pour-overs and I've racked my brain about an effective way to do this and it is a tricky one. I don't want to just go and sort of find out how fine I can go while it still tastes good because pour-overs are a percolation brew and if you watch that recent video on immersion versus percolation you'll know that technique is the ceiling here, not necessarily the grinder. So here, I'm going to set them all to a very similar extraction level for a pour-over. I'm going to aim for about 22% extraction. It's a little bit arbitrary, I absolutely give you that, but I'll be using a refractometer to dial them in identically and then I'll taste them and compare them. I'd be curious to see how big the differences really are. So we're ready for the tasting part now and I'm actually really excited about this. Now this is not a blind tasting because the idea that I would judge a grinder on a single cup of coffee is completely absurd. I'm going to use this comparative tasting because it's really interesting for me as well to do this comparatively, but I do want to bring with me the experience of brewing coffee on these grinders over the last couple of months. I will say, it looks like this is shot in one day, this video has been shot over multiple days to, you know combat palate fatigue as well. Let's get into some testing. Now, as I said, these have all been dialed in to a very similar extraction level and one that was below the point at which it was sort of too fine for a V60 technique to work where you get a lot of channeling and that kind of stuff. So they're all very well extracted and they all taste very nice. I think what you see again is that I have the high uniformity burr set here in the P-64. A burr set optimized around espresso because it gives a slightly wider particle distribution and I think you can taste that here. It has just a little bit more texture which some people might really enjoy but it has a little less clarity of flavor than some of the other cups here. Interestingly, what you saw from a drawdown perspective is that this had the slowest drawdown, whereas the two grinders, I think are sort of hitting high uniformity the most effectively which would be the Monolith Max and the Levercraft Ultra, they had the quickest drawdowns. The EK and the EG both had sort of similar drawdowns. The EK was actually slightly slower, that was interesting. So moving into the EG-1  Really, a very nice sweet brew, no real astringency at this sort of higher extraction, very pleasant, mass clarity, just very enjoyable, no complaints here. And even though, again, it feels like a burr set that is not optimized for espresso necessarily, but you know, slightly less uniform, it feels like in comparison to the P-64, the EG-1 has a little bit more uniformity and you can taste that in a little bit more clarity. What about the Max?  This is an interesting cup to me. You know, this grinder I feel is optimized around espresso brewing and more unimodal style espresso brewing. The cup here is again, sweet and that's been a feature that we've come up against a couple of times with this grinder. It is, to some extent, possibly lacking a little complexity compared to some of the others, but it is incredibly enjoyable. I'm aware I'm nitpicking right now because you don't usually get to compare these grinders side-by-side and if I was just drinking this cup of coffee, I'd be having a very nice time. It is very enjoyable. It feels perhaps a little bit more linear, not simple necessarily, but, but just lacking a touch of complexity compared to the others. Tasting the Levercraft, I say compared to the others but these two cups are to me the most similar. They're different and there's actually a little bit less texture in the Ultra, which is interesting. It's quite a kind of light, bright, sweet, nice complexity but not quite as full. Even though it's a similar kind of extraction. I cannot infer what that means, I can only tell you what it tastes like. Again I've enjoyed brewed coffee from this grinder very much. It's tasted very nice indeed. The EK here is performing well but I feel it is a little outshone. I'm not sure exactly which burr set is in the EK right now. I feel like they've changed it around a few times recently. This is a very nice cup. It doesn't have any flaws necessarily. It just lacks a little bit of the clarity that many of the other cups here have. It has texture, it has some sweetness, you know you can taste the coffee there. It's important to clarify just how close these are you know, in, in the wider context of good and bad coffee, these are all absolutely clustered up at the very end of very good and it's kind of by zooming into that that we're picking apart the differences. This is all very tasty. So there's one piece of testing we did that I think was very interesting. We ground some coffee to test the speed of sort of throughput of the grinders and at the same time compared the sort of sound levels they produce running empty and running grinding. Now, this was pretty simple to do. We put the decibel meter a fixed distance from the grinders each time, and we ran it with and without coffee, and here are the results. Now, what I will say about the sound levels in particular is that they don't tell the whole story. Decibels don't tell you how pleasant the sound was. So, alongside this information, I'll give you my ranking of nicest sounding to least nice sounding. At the top, the nicest sounding grinder is the Levercraft. It is the least offensive sounding to me when it's grinding coffee. Second is probably the P-64. Third probably is the Monolith. It's technically the quietest but it doesn't sound quite as pleasant as the others. Fourth would be the EG-1 and fifth is the EK-43 because it is just so much louder than the others and it's quite an abrasive sound because it's so loud. In terms of productivity, in terms of how quickly they grind. This was an interesting test. In particular because I think it speaks to the fact that RPM is not everything when it comes to speed and I think people correlate them a little bit too closely. Even though I was using grinders at different RPMs, really it's the burr set that will drive this and that's best illustrated by the fact that if you run the Monolith Max at 350 and the Levercraft Ultra at 350 there is a huge, huge difference in grinding time. The Levercraft is just much, much, much faster than the Monolith. I'm not here to say that's good or bad, I'm just here to highlight the differences in speed between the grinders. Now, I think we should probably wrap up and I'll talk through each of the grinders and give a kind of summary of my thoughts and share which one or ones were my favorites. So how do I summarize the glorious absurdity of this particular video of all of this testing? Because I feel like a spoiled brat complaining about the nicest toys money can buy. They're all fantastic grinders. I'll have little complaints about all of them but I will say, they all do a great job of making delicious coffee. So by way of a summary I'll tell you who I think might be the perfect candidate for each of these grinders. So the Lagom P-64 from Option-O. I think if you're a bit space constrained, if you're a little bit budget constrained, compared to the rest of the stuff here, then it makes for an excellent choice. If you're looking for something for an espresso setup then yeah, I think the high uniformity burrs work super well. Yes, they're a little bit smaller in terms of burr size than the rest of them here but I don't feel like it's a massive compromise from that perspective. If you were looking for something to do a bit of both that's a harder choice to me because you know, you're not realistically going to be switching burrs very often, as easy as it is to do with this grinder, but I think for espresso particularly it's a pretty great choice. The EG-1 is the most expensive grinder but I think from a build and construction perspective you can absolutely see where your money is going. It's incredibly well-built. It's incredibly thoughtfully built. The detail is there throughout and in terms of performance it's a great all rounder, if you need great espresso, grate filter coffee and something that is sympathetic to that workflow, this is a great choice. But it's very expensive, but I understand why and I don't think it's overpriced for what you're getting in the world of high-end grinders. The Monolith Max again, very, very expensive and it feels more focused from a workflow and build perspective around espresso and it does perform well for espresso too. Really well. I really enjoyed the shots from this. Very delicious. It does perform well for filter coffee, but I feel like the workflow isn't optimized the same way that a grinder like this might be. However, if I had the budget and I just brewed espresso all the time I would be tempted by this grinder. The Levercraft Ultra to me kind of feels like it belongs in an espresso lab. Somewhere where you'd have the space to accommodate all of it, as well as a place where you'd want to do the kind of experiments that only this grinder lets you do. Grinding at different RPM feels like you're at the fringe of espresso experimentation and then throwing on RPM profiling it feels like you're at the fringe of that fringe. It is a brave new world. I don't know what will come of it but if you are the sort of person that wants to do those kinds of experiments, this is an interesting option. Its performance was excellent. It was enjoyable to use I didn't love the build as much as some of the others, but but it is a well-made grinder. The Mahlk\u00f6nig EK43S has one singular advantage over all the rest of them. If you need to grind more than 50 grams of coffee at a time, well, really this is it. This is a work horse it's built to do high volumes, it's built to be in a cafe. Most of these other grinders are expressly built for the home. You know, these are built for the home and not for cafes. This is built for a cafe, but this is really built to be a Jack of all trades in a commercial environment. If you want that performance at home I understand why you might choose this, but I just don't think it's optimized for a home experience. I don't think it's optimized for the workflow of making either filter coffee or espresso, especially at home, but commercially speaking it's the only one I would consider putting into a cafe, and for that reason it sort of doesn't belong in this grouping but because people are buying them for the home it seemed necessary to include it in this testing group. So, if I had to pick one, if I had to pick one, which would I pick? And to be honest I'd be torn between these two grinders here, the two most expensive ones. I think for my personal applications, where I'm brewing a lot of different coffee, where I'm brewing espresso and brewing filter and I'm bouncing around all over the place, this might be the winner. For me, the workflow, the performance all of those things work for my particular needs and so this is probably my favorite grinder of these ones here, but it just pips the Monolith which I really enjoyed using. Fantastic performance and again, if my workflow was even more espresso-heavy than it is now, this might've been an even more difficult decision for me to make. Now, if you're watching this and you've got something like a a Baratza Sette or a Wilfa Uniform or a Fellow Ode or something like that, and one of those kinds of grinders, I don't want you to think that you're massively missing out on your coffee experience. Here we're really talking about chasing down, you know those diminishing returns and they are diminishing returns. Yes, you could taste the difference between these two grinders. If you took a mid range grinder and any one of these things, yes, you would taste the difference but, it's pretty small. In the great scheme of coffee from bad coffee to okay coffee to great coffee, you really working within a small section of quality. So, so you should know what your money gets you if you ever chose to spend more and it does improve coffee but it is an incremental improvement. But for those of us obsessed with the details and wanting to go as far as we can, well, that's why these grinders exist. Now I don't get to keep any of these. These all get given away to my Patreon backers. They've allowed me to go and buy these five incredible grinders, put them up at the bench, compare them, contrast them and experiment and honestly, I've learned a ton.", "videoID": "6LGeBcUZ9YA"}, {"title": "The Best Coffee Storage Canister", "text": "Today, we're gonna look at something that had been heavily requested.

We're gonna be looking at a whole range of storage canisters and containers, and trying to understand what impact they have on your coffee and which one potentially might be the best. Now, there are 11 different options here in front of me, that is by no means exhaustive, but we're gonna look at them from a sort of technology perspective, and hopefully you can take what we learn here and apply it to other models on the market and decide if they work for you. To begin with, I'll walk you through each of them here, what they are, who made them, and what they cost. So starting at the beginning we've got an OXO Good Grips container here, we've got a Hario container for coffee here, we've got the Friis container, very popular, though this exact model seems to be made or branded by a number of different companies, we've got a little Bodum jar down here, we've got the Coffeevac system here, this is the Airscape container, this is the Prepara, this is the MiiR Coffee Canister, here we've got the Vacuum Saver storage system, here is one from Ankomn, and at the end is the Fellow Atmos container. I have divided them into three different categories. The first category is essentially these five here, and these are air tight. Essentially, each of them has a lid that seals the unit, prevents air getting out, but that's the beginning and the end of the technology inside it for keeping coffee fresh. Then we have this middle section, these three here, which are displacement. In some way, there's some system, very clearly obvious in this one, that is designed to push any air out. You leave some in amongst the beans, but you'll displace quite a lot of air before sealing it airtight. The final section here would be what I would call evacuation, they're vacuum canisters. You're not gonna pull a perfect vacuum, that's really not gonna happen, but you are gonna significantly reduce the amount of oxygen, the amount of air inside the storage container. As you can see inside of all of these there is some coffee. This coffee is now about six weeks old, and I wanted to push it quite a long way in the hope that any variants in taste would be much more obvious. And it was roasted for espresso, it's roasted relatively light for espresso, but it is still for espresso. The darker you roast a coffee, the quicker it will stale. Again, I'm trying to amplify some of the differences we might see here in the hope of having a more obvious outcome at the end of this. So we're gonna do a simple taste test first, even though it's roasted for espresso, I am still going to cup it, that's the easiest way to do a flavor-based assessment, and I'll be able to see if there's any broad kind of trends here. Does one technology do better than another? After that we are gonna pour some shots of espresso. Now, one more quick note that is important the Airscape, due to issues with being difficult to shop for during the pandemic, turned up after the test had begun, so this one I can comment on the technology, but not the actual results or tastings from this because it arrived after the rest of the tasting had begun. The coffee inside all of these came from the exact same batch. It is the same roast inside all of these, so they should be pretty much identical, therefore it didn't make sense to add some coffee to this later where the variants could come from some roasting variation or even just a difference in aging time. I hope that there are enough insights from this to say whether this is useful or not, and I can certainly talk about the build and the cost and all that kind of stuff at the end, but it is just worth noting that this could not sadly make it into the full round of testing. So as an initial taste test here's what we're gonna do, we've got 10 cups of coffee steeping away, in the kind of cupping tasting style, if you don't know what cupping is check the video up here. Each of them has been given a random four digit code, so I don't know what's what, they're also been mixed up, and I don't know what I'm tasting in what order. This is kind of an initial tasting to see if there are any big differences between the different technologies there. We should see some consistent results if there are, each of the ones that are say evacuation should taste similar to each other, if they don't, that'll be interesting, if they do, that'll be interesting. In a minute I'll give them all a quick smell, we'll break them, clean them up, get them ready for tasting, and then we'll taste our way through and just see if there's anything obvious screaming out from a taste perspective. As I go I'm just gonna start to push or pull things that I like or dislike a little bit to try and get down to maybe three or four that I like more than others. So what I've done here is a kind of staggering of things. There are a couple of things that I like more, there's a bunch of stuff in the middle, and there's a couple of things I like less. It's really close. I have to say I expected a bigger difference between all of these things. It'll be interesting to see if more variation has shown up in other testing, but here if it's not in the same category well that's kind of interesting. I'll take it as a win for those particular products, but if it's not consistent, that'd be a surprise. So having had a look at the results in my laptop, broadly there's some trends, which is evacuation does a little bit better, that doesn't mean every canister that's an evacuation canister does better. And while the Fellow did well and the Vacuum coffee Saver did well, this one up here was interesting, which is just the Coffeevac, which is just a straight displacement system. So it's not universal, certainly, you had some good results with a straight displacement, but evacuation on average did a little bit better with exception of the Ankomn, that didn't do as well on this test. Generally speaking, a little bit more sweetness and clarity in the evacuated canisters. So yeah, I think that's a kind of a win for the category and a little win for a few here, but also a win for the Coffeevac, which I thought did pretty well. Let's move on to some espresso testing. What I wanted to do with espresso testing was a couple of things, firstly what I was interested in was pulling some shots and looking at how much crema I got. I was interested in that because the theory might be that if you held a coffee under vacuum, for example, well it might degas faster. Would that have a negative impact on your espresso? That seemed like a question worth answering. To do this I had to create a bit of a weird set up. Now I brought my Decent in, which you'll see a little bit more on the channel soon. And what I wanted to do was use its naked portafilter to pull shots into a funnel directly into a graduated cylinder that I could use to test the volume that I was getting. If that was on a scale, I could measure my mass, I could get my volume, and then ultimately a simple density calculation at the end of it. That would tell me, broadly speaking, how much crema I had, how much of that volume was foam. So I did that, I pulled at the same grind setting 'cause it was the same coffee, what had been an ideally kind of 28, 29 second shot, though what we saw were some pretty big variances in shot time. Slower shots produced more crema because slower shots seemingly channeled less. And that was really the key. Looking at these shots brew, the faster shots just had a lot more channeling. Now the ordering of this wasn't by category, it was totally random, so I don't think it was a case of the grinder itself changing or shifting in some way. There was just a pretty strong correlation. What was interesting to me is that the method that produced the slowest shots were vacuum canisters, notably so. At the other end of the spectrum were just the airtight canisters, those produced espresso with a lot more channeling. The shots looked pretty hideous, they just fell apart really, really, really quickly. So for me, that was a reasonably conclusive test. There's a correlation I cannot fathom the causation. I don't know why storage method is impacting the flow of the espresso this way, but it definitely is. And displacement sat in the middle of the two. So as you'd kind of expect in theory, vacuum did best, displacement did okay, airtight did the worst. Assessing tastes on these was kind of difficult because you're assessing not necessarily the flavors retained by the grounds, but the quality of the espresso brew in terms of evenness, which made it not a particularly useful tasting from that perspective. So I'm not gonna talk about any tasting data for espresso. I guess it's time to get them all back. To summarize I'll break them down category by category, talk about my favorites, my least favorites, the what's, the why's, and at the end of it, hopefully, you can go away and make some informed decisions about how you want to store your coffee and in what you want to store your coffee. So let's talk about the airtight category here, just the ones that have a simple sealing solution. At the beginning the OXO, it's pretty expensive, it's very big, it's kind of a weird shape, the method for sealing is just this simple button on top that when you press this in, presses out and compresses the seal against the side walls. Works totally fine. The Friis, also okay. You've got a little dial on top here so that you can set your date with, the date that the coffee was roasted or the date that you stored it. I suspect roasted. Early obviously, it's got 31 days on there, so you've gotta do the maths yourself, but at least you know what's in there. The Hario one is similar in a way to the OXO, just a little switch to open and close things. Really very similar to this. Now, the Bodum, probably the simplest container of all of them here, build fine, it's glass-bottomed, plastic-topped, it's just a little gasket. It's surprising that so many of these went for glass. Generally speaking coffee is better stored away from sunlight, certainly direct sunlight, so you know these two are a little bit better. Now, this one was interesting to me, the Coffeevac, the way this works is a little bit more complicated, you can't get the lid off until you push this button that essentially opens a valve allowing air in and out. So it's a really clever, tight fit. Again, I can't put this on until I push the valve. This doesn't really displace any air, but it is obviously a very good seal. It tasted pretty good, the coffee out of this. So whether it was an advantage of being stored in the dark, I don't know, but of these I liked this the best. It was also notably cheaper than some of the other options here. Certainly this I think is oddly expensive for what it is. So as value goes, if you're gonna go this route, this would work fine. Now this does imply that something like a Mason jar or something like that would also work very well, and this is comparable in some ways, if you've got a bag that has a zip seal that allows you to reseal the bag properly, well, you may as well use that than one of these. So under the displacement category, and these are similarly priced, this is a little bit cheaper, but from a build and experience perspective, for me, is notably behind on these two. It worked okay, I've got quite large hands, and so getting them into that space certainly as this got deeper would become quite uncomfortable. If you've got smaller hands than mine, and I confess I have reasonably large hands, that's not gonna be an issue, but hey, it's an issue for me. The MiiR, the build is very nice. Inside its displacement method though is a little bit finicky. So you drop this on top of your coffee beans, and then you essentially flip that handle down to create the seal around the edges. That sort of moment when your hand is in the container, again, certainly towards the bottom of the container is a little bit awkward. As you push to one side, you'll see the whole thing kind of twist, so you're kind of pushing down with one hand, pushing across with the other. It's a little bit awkward for me. It works, I like it, I think it's very well made, but that moment for me is just a little bit fussy. Now the Airscape works kind of as a hybrid between these two, it's much wider which I definitely like, the materials are quite simple, and so it's certainly not too expensive. It's about the same price as this, a touch cheaper. But to get this in and just push it down much easier. And the little flip handle to go down, super nice. I think this is really well made, I think it works well, I would probably pick it as my displacement method of choice of this particular category. Taste-wise there was not a significant difference between any of them really. There were broad trends, but you could pick that tasting data to pieces. We'll come back to that in a second. And so now the last section which is the vacuum containers, the evacuation kind of methods, we'll start here with the Vacuum Coffee Saver. This one is a two piece thing, you've gotta get the little valve that sits on top then you're gonna do that awkward pumping thing. You don't really know when you're done, you know it works and the lid becomes quite hard to get off. To release the valve is a bit awkward, you have to sort of lift this little valve thing up until you hear the air go back inside, and now it's equalized and getting the lid off is merely a little bit difficult and not incredibly difficult. Overall this system isn't particularly great unless you're maybe using something like this with wine bottles all the time, and you've got one of these lying around. It's bulky, it's two pieces, it worked okay, I'm not critical of it as a storage device. The experience of it is a little bit fussier. And now the Ankomn. Now the Ankomn have done a bunch of different sizes and they work pretty simply that you just put the lid on and twist , and to release the vacuum you just push the little button. So overall it worked very well, they come in a bunch of different sizes. It isn't quite as nice as our last contender though. And in both of these cases, this is true, you don't really know when you've done the job of pulling the air out. That in a funny sort of way is one of the big advantages of the Fellow. The Fellow was the most expensive, and the Fellow is the nicest. It works the best, it's the most thought through. It's not perfect, but of the ones I tested, it would be my choice to keep. The way it works is very simple, you've got to press to release valve on top. And the evacuation method is a little bit awkward. It's one of the flaws I guess, you do a kind of backwards forwards thing. The good news is that it tells you when to stop. You keep doing that until a little green line appears around the vacuum section here, showing that you have a vacuum. When you do this with very fresh coffee, you do see those little gauges depressurize essentially, because enough gas has come out of the grounds it seems that you don't have the same pressure that you did before. That means no new air is getting in, there's just a bit more gas filling that vacuum inside this space. What I saw is that the first few times I sealed it when I came back to it a day or two later, the little green circle had disappeared. It was just that there was CO2 coming quite rapidly out of those very fresh coffee beans. After a week or so, that simply didn't happen anymore. I don't think it's a fault of the product, I don't think there's a way around it other than you keep going back to it regularly and try to pull more of the CO2 out, but there's no real advantage to that. So don't worry about it. The criticisms if anything would be that there's a little bit more complexity to this part where you might wanna clean. There's no real obvious way to disassemble this or clean this if it got dirty over time. Hopefully you shouldn't have much coffee coming into contact with this, it's not like you're gonna be shaking your tin around or storing it upside down or anything like that, but it's an issue, and yeah the backwards and forwards is not quite as nice. And so that kind of takes us to an endpoint wherein I would say of the containers tested I think the Fellow was probably the best. It's the most expensive though, but the features are nice, it looks great, it feels very well made, and it produced good results. But the results from a taste perspective were not what I hoped them to be. I didn't see massive, massive differences in taste between those different coffees. And that was surprising to me. That would also mean that in many situations, I'm probably happy storing coffee inside a resealable bag. Assuming that bag is well-made, airtight otherwise, and obviously dark and not transparent, but if that isn't an option to you, if you want something different, if you don't want the bags around, if you just don't like them, if you're getting coffee delivered in something that isn't designed for longer-term storage and you're looking for a container, my preference would be for the Fellow.", "videoID": "K0JWuhE8a-w"}, {"title": "How I Make Espresso\uff1a Tools and Techniques", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about espresso puck prep. We're gonna go through the techniques and the tools involved in getting your ground coffee ready for optimal brewing inside an espresso machine. And today we're gonna talk about techniques that I hope are universal, whether you've got a cheap espresso machine that you've just started with. Whether you've got a very expensive, high-end espresso machine, everything I talk about today should be applicable to what you do. Now, the goal of espresso puck prep is basically to get that little puck of coffee ready so that when the water flows through it, it flows through as evenly as possible. That's it, that's the goal. We want it to flow through at a certain kind of time, we want to control how much liquid goes through it, but those are kind of outside of the prep piece of this thing. Now, I come from the professional coffee world, the cafe world, where there seems to be frighteningly little puck prep in most places, even good places. They seem to dose the coffee, maybe settle it a little bit, maybe distribute it, tamp it, brew it, and it's good. And we're gonna do a lot more than that because I think we can get better espresso. And again, our goals are kind of different. Cafes wanna make good espresso as quickly and easily as possible as they can. We wanna make incredible espresso every time we make espresso. What I'm gonna do is go through each of the stages of puck prep and talk through some of the options that you have and some of the techniques that people use, the impact that they have, and give you what is ultimately my opinion about how important they are. Is it worth doing? Now, as you'll see in front of me, there's a lot of stuff. There's a lot of stuff involved in espresso puck prep, and I'm aware that maybe I have a reputation of spending other people's money by making them want things. Please, please, please maximize your current setup before you think about upgrading. You're definitely gonna have a little bit of FOMO here or a kind of desire for one more new thing. Try and keep that in check until you're sure it's gonna solve a problem that you have. To end this video, I'll share my personal puck prep routine. I'll make a kind of real-time espresso starting from the beans to ending it with a drink, everything in between, because I don't do every single thing that I'm gonna talk about today when I make espresso. So first step is kind of gonna be bean prep, and I'm gonna recommend for many people, especially when they're starting and getting to know their grinder, weighing both the input and output from the grinder. So you're gonna weigh your coffee beans, and then you're gonna weigh the grounds once they're in the portafilter as well. Not every grinder is a zero retention grinder or a low retention grinder, so you wanna make sure that you're getting out what you're putting in. So for me here, I'm gonna dose 18 and a half grams in and I'm gonna grind it, and then I'll weigh it in the portafilter to see how we've done. Now, this is maybe tangential to puck prep, but it's kind of part of the whole routine. I'm gonna use what's called the Ross Droplet Technique. You can either, I think the first time I started doing this, I would get a teaspoon wet, just run it under a tap and stir it into the beans. More commonly now, you're gonna get a little spray bottle and just spray a single spray over those coffee beans. If you're doing this once or twice a day, I think it's fine to spray every single dose. If you're making a lot of espresso, you'll find that your weighing vessel gets a little damp and you don't need to spray. If your manufacturer of your grinder recommends you don't do this, then maybe you just use the sort of teaspoon method. But for most grinders, a little spray of water on beans does absolutely no damage. It reduces static and reduces retention, and that makes it a good thing. The last little thing is before I dose coffee into my portafilter, I'm gonna make sure my basket is completely dry. I like to use a little bit of toweling for that. Nice and dry and clean. Dosing into a wet basket can sort of encourage water to flow where water's already been, and you get a kind of additional flow around the edges of the puck rather than through it, or so goes the theory. Anyway, to grind. So on the scale, we've got 18 and a half grams out. That's kind of what we wanted, and so we can move into the next phase, which is ultimately the most important phase of puck prep, and that is distribution. Things are gonna get a bit more opinionated here, but first I'm gonna talk about one more tool, which is a dosing funnel. They look like this, and they sit on top of your portafilter. This one, I particularly like because it has magnets so it sticks really nicely on there so it's just a little bit more reassuring, but it's not by any stretch essential. This is useful in the next phase with different kinds of distribution because it will prevent spillage and mess. Because if we take it off and look at the basket right now, we've got this mound of coffee in the middle, and around the edges, we've got some coffee sort of gaps or troughs, so to speak. If I just compress this now with my tamper, I will not have an even bed of coffee. The thinner parts of the bed will be much easier for water to get through, and so more water will flow through less coffee, and that won't taste great. So what we need to do is distribute the coffee evenly around the basket. There's a number of ways to do that. Additionally, you'll see that there's kind of clumps here, where as part of the grinding process, the grounds have almost been slightly squeezed together, and they will stay as clumps after they've been tamped and there'll be a more dense pocket of coffee compared to the pocket around them. Again, they promote uneven extraction. We wanna get rid of the clumps. So, as I said, there's kind of four approaches to distribution. And that brings us back to tools. This one here is my favorite. It's by a company called Sworkdesign It's a bit more expensive, I confess. You can make these yourself actually quite cheaply. You can get a cork from a wine bottle and some acupuncture needles, and be on your way to something very similar to this, or you can buy a kind of finished tool, or there's kind of option's in between. They don't have to be expensive, but I think they are a very good tool. You can get this style, which has the loops on the end here. These for me, I don't really recommend, I don't particularly like the looped-ended tools. I prefer a finer needle. In a kind of more commercial sense where you might wanna go a bit faster, you do have things like this. So this was a sort of cheap thing I think AliExpress. This sits on top of the portafilter, it has a spring inside,  and then you twist it to essentially rake the needles around in there. This particular one I don't recommend 'cause the needles don't go deep enough. The one I do recommend of this style is insanely expensive. It's called DUOMO The Eight and it has less needles, but its build is very nice. This sort of sits on top. You spin it and it does some distribution. It breaks up clumps. It comes on a little stand that cleans it, and if I was trying to do this in a cafe, this would make sense. At home, I'm just not sure I could recommend you spend this much money. Back to the job in hand. What we're gonna do is get our needles in there and start deep, start right at the bottom of the basket and essentially stir and move around the coffee inside. We're looking to make sure that the coffee's evenly distributed from the base. Any clumps in the bottom section are broken up, then work up a little bit higher until you're just sort of dealing with the top section, and you should have afterwards a very nice, even looking bed of coffee. This for me is sort of prepped and ready to tamp and move on with. Now, I would recommend it. I like it, but there are other ways to distribute coffee before tamping, and so let's talk about the next one, which is wedge distributors. So in the world of wedge distributors, there's a few different styles. I think most people are familiar with the one from Ona Coffee from Sasa Sestic that was known I think initially as the OCD, the Ona Coffee Distributor. There's also something like this from Pullman, which again works in a similar kind of way. And the idea is that this thing is gonna go and do kind of two jobs. As you move it around, it's gonna smooth the coffee around inside the basket to help distribute it. It's also in that process gonna apply some pressure to the point that some people recommend just distributing and not tamping. So it goes in and you rotate and you smooth it around, and you end up with what looks very nice. It looks very even, it's quite satisfying, it feels like it's well tamped. You've done a good job, so to speak. One thing you can do to sort of compare them is get something like this. This is a 58 millimeter glass jar. Yes, you do a reasonable job of kind of moving coffee around the top part of the basket, but I think with wedge distributors, they're just not really touching the stuff in the bottom half or having real impact there, and so for me, I'm just not a huge fan of them. I don't think they're necessarily damaging to your espresso, but I just say, I just prefer needle distribution for me and the style of espresso that I drink. The third style of distribution we should briefly talk about is one that has pretty much fallen out of fashion, but is very much how I learned, which is what I would call manual distribution or just using your hands. When I started in coffee, coffee grinder technology was pretty poor in some ways and grinders did not produce a fixed dose of coffee for you every time you wanted one. Instead, you had to use your basket as a kind of volumetric fill. That meant you had to be very consistent in the way that you distributed your coffee to make sure that you had an even basket full and why to this day I hate volumetric measurements in cooking. There were really two major techniques around. If you bought David Schomer's book when it came out, you'll have seen he kind of did a north, south, east, west distribution, where you kind of push the coffee around with a flat finger like so to try and get it to be all over the bed. If you were into espresso around the, I don't know, early 2000s, you'd have seen what was called the Stockfleth's distribution method that used the sort of bit of your thumb here, and you would smooth it around like that on a finish, and then it looked, you know, okay. It's a really easy technique to mess up and be inconsistent with. The last one on the distribution front that I wanna talk about is vibration distribution, because I think a lot of people are curious if this is a good idea or not. In fact, you can buy a vibration distributor for espresso. This is the Nurri, and this is what it's for. Your portafilter would sit in here, and then you run it  and it would vibrate your bed of coffee. And in theory, you'd think that would help, that would help sort of settle it out very evenly. I'll show you how it works. It's kind of fun and you get some distribution for sure. It doesn't really break up clumps in the same way. And the interesting thing about this, and I think this was tested in \"Modernist Cuisine\" using sort of ultrasonics as well, is that you seemingly get some movement of fine particles down to the bottom of the basket. Flow with this is slower than with sort of needle distribution as a kind of comparison point, so it seems to be that you get a little sandbagging. There's lots of fines that sort of sit at the bottom of the puck, and that for me isn't a great thing, though it is a fun and interesting little toy to play with. Now, one other piece of puck prep kit that I think is notable and kind of interesting is also from Sworkdesign, who I mentioned earlier. They make the PorcuPress, which is really interesting. This is another collection of sort of acupuncture needles designed to sit on top of your prepped but not yet tamped bed. And then you're supposed to press it down, rotate it a little bit, press it down, rotate it a little bit again. and press it down. And in doing so, you have produced an enormous number of holes across the bed of coffee. Now, the idea is that when you tamp this now, you'll have kind of seeded pathways for water throughout the puck. It's interesting. It's another expensive tool. There is an impact from it. I think Sprometheus did a good video about this particular thing. I'll leave a link to that down below, but it is just an interesting thing to see people experimenting with these kind of ideas for what I think are incremental gains, but I'm never gonna be against incremental gains. So next up is an interesting one, and I would say it's the thing that was the biggest surprise in testing. It was definitely something that kind of caught me by surprise a little bit, despite the fact that I've been aware of this now for a good long while, and that is using a little bit of paper at the bottom of your espresso basket. Now this started I think originally with people concerned about the quantities of some of the lipids in coffee in their espresso. There have been some papers linking consumption of kind of unfiltered coffee to blood cholesterol and therefore to heart disease. I'm not saying that's a thing and I don't really wanna get into that in this video, but that's what started this whole thing off. Now, a bit of paper like this at the bottom will filter out any fine pieces from your coffee, and that means you'll get no flecking, no tiger stripes on top of your espresso anymore. It will filter out some of the lipids in coffee, some of the oils, and that will have a small but noticeable impact on texture and mouth feel, but it's actually not as big as you'd think. It does have another super interesting impact. In testing, it caused the flow of the espresso to increase quite dramatically. Shots that we're pulling at say 28, 29 seconds were suddenly pulling at 23 seconds. And in doing so, it also increased their extraction quite notably. The frustrating thing is that it's actually quite hard to get a food safe bit of paper that fits the bottom of the basket. Some people have been using scientific papers. They are not rated as kind of food safe. I don't think there's a huge risk there, but you should be aware of the risks of kind of non-food safe papers. Here I'm using a Pullman basket because it fits a hole-punched Chemex paper. So you can buy hole punches of two and a quarter inches very easily on the internet. I'll leave a link down below, and then you can just punch out from something like a Chemex filter paper a bunch of these little things and they fit some baskets very well. Some people like to wet the paper before they dose, just to make sure that there's no kind of impact of the WDT or the needle distribution at that point. I haven't seen any inconsistency or issues with the dry paper. Obviously you don't wanna get the sides of the basket too damp. You wanna keep those nice and dry, but yeah, the bottom can be a little bit damp. That's okay. Now, as you can see, it has no negative impact on crema. There's plenty of the good foamy stuff on top if that's what you like. That's a tasty, clean, balanced espresso. I sort of hate the fact that I feel this way. It's more work, it's more effort, it's a bit more waste, but I like what a paper filter at the bottom of an espresso basket does to the shot, to the extraction, to the whole process. I don't think it's essential, but I do think it's worth experimenting with, though I wish there was just an easier way to get filter papers for these things that fit espresso baskets and that fit say VST baskets, because VST baskets are a different size. You'll see the Aeropress is that little bit bigger, so it absolutely will not fit inside a basket. And some people have been doing a kind of sandwich of these things, so one at the bottom and also one at the top, though that has become less common with the advent of the next thing to talk about, which are puck screens. These are puck screens. These are sort of thick discs of metal mesh designed to sit exactly on top of your puck, edge to edge inside your basket, and do a couple of things. Firstly, they should act as an additional water distribution aid. They should help the water coming from the shower screen spread more evenly over the puck of coffee. Secondly, the theory is that they prevent sort of excessive expansion of the puck during pre-infusion, which helps create a more even extraction afterwards. Do they work? Well, in testing, I think they do, yes. I saw an increase in extraction when using these. It wasn't an enormous increase, but it was consistent and it was consistent across different brands, which was good to know. They are, however, frustrating and fussy things to use. They're irritating and difficult to clean. Some people have resorted to ultrasonic cleaning baths. Steaming them with some Cafiza or espresso machine cleaner isn't a bad option either, but they are a little bit of faff, and so whether they are worth it, so to speak, in terms of the cost of buying one, the sort of pain of using one really depends how obsessed you are with squeezing every last single drop out of the coffee that you have. All of this leads us to the last stage of espresso puck prep, which is tamping. Now, obviously you'll tamp and then put on say a puck screen if you're gonna do that, but I figured this was kind of a nice last step to talk about. If you wanna use a traditional tamper, then the ergonomics are important in terms of looking after your body. You wanna hold it kind of like a doorknob, thumb pointing down the whole tamper. And when you tamp, you wanna have your elbow right above the coffee, as if you're about to sort of screw in a screw that might be sticking out of the wood surface. You've got a screwdriver in your hand and you would get right over it so you could drive down and apply pressure. Now here, you don't need to twist. You're just looking to press down as evenly as possible until the coffee stops feeling squishy. That's it, and you're trying to press as much air out of the coffee as you can to make sure that the bed is even, there's no air pockets left behind. I like to rotate the tamper very slightly so that with my fingertips I can feel if I'm level or not. If I'm not level, I'll feel it as my fingers rotate. Twisting, polishing, that kinda stuff, I learned to do it and no one knows why we did it. We've mostly stopped doing it. It feels nice. It feels a little bit flashy. It does nothing for your coffee, so don't worry about it. That's a traditional tamp. On the tamping front, there are obviously other options. You can use a wedge distributor. You do have things like this, which is the Force Tamper, which is a very expensive solution to a problem. Now, when it comes to tamping pressure, it's kind of a binary thing. You've either pushed hard enough to get rid of the air pockets or you haven't. Pushing harder than hard enough makes no difference to extraction or flow rate or anything like that, so it's not a a complexity of the espresso brewing process or of puck prep, but something like this will sort of stop pressing at a certain pressure. You'll hear a kind of click  like that, where you've crossed a threshold of pressure and you've definitely pressed hard enough and it won't press any harder. Additionally, the sort of design of this means that it sits on the rim of the basket and it should tamp perfectly level every time. These are expensive. They're very nice and they definitely take away a variable that some people worry about, and they sort of strip some of the pleasure of espresso. So for some, it is a good worthwhile investment. For others, it doesn't really make a good return on their investment. If they're comfortable, safe, and consistent in their manual tamping, then they may enjoy using one of these things. And there a lot of beautiful tampers out there. I made a video about that once. Now I'm aware we've gotten to this point and we've covered a lot of ground. And in doing it this kind of way, I feel like I've thrown a lot of information at you, which is why at the end of this thing, I kind of want to just go through a real-time puck prep so you can see what it looks like and decide for yourself, is this seemingly too much faff or is it too much work, or actually, is it pretty simple and easy and probably worth the time and effort involved? But before we do that, we do need to have a quick ad for this video sponsor, which is Surfshark. Surfshark is a VPN that is fast, easy to use, easy to install, and with one account, you can install it on unlimited devices. Now you might ask, why do you need a VPN? And I think there's a couple of really good use cases in the real world for using a VPN and having it be part of your life. Firstly, it lets you travel the world virtually. You wanna explore content on streaming services in other countries, well, you can log in to one of their 3200 different servers, find something in the country you want to go to and unlock the content that is georestricted that you couldn't otherwise access. And secondly, a VPN adds a layer of security and anonymity to your online browsing. It might be that you are concerned about your security in an online environment, in a public wifi, or it might be that you just wanna get the best possible deals, and VPNs can help you sort of prevent people georestricting prices or showing you worse prices based on where you are.

Go to surfshark.deal/jameshoffmann, or as I said, click the link in the description down below. Thank you to Surfshark for sponsoring this video. Now let's make some espresso. One last thing before we close out: This t-shirt, that print over there, is the Coffee is an Act of Kindness design that we've had actually for a little while now, and we've just launched it now. All proceeds, all profits from the t-shirt and the print will go to four different charities all operating and helping with the crisis, with the war in Ukraine being, I think, grotesquely waged by Russia. It's horrifying to see and so we wanna support it in some way, so these are now available. The t-shirts are limited run. The poster will be around for a little while, as well.", "videoID": "xb3IxAr4RCo"}, {"title": "Buying A Vintage Espresso Machine", "text": "This picture behind me depicts the Roman Bridge in Rimini and it hangs here in Rimini in the City Museum. It was painted by a Welshman, Richard Wilson. He came here in the 1750s, sketched the bridge, took those sketches home and painted this picture. It's considered important because it's a great depiction of what is considered a very important piece of Roman architecture. But more than that, it has a wider consequence and meaning. This was an influential picture. Other painters saw it and decided to come to Rimini. Rimini had not been part of the Grand Tour of Europe that many British artists were taking, and suddenly it was. You might ask, quite fairly, what on earth has this got to do with coffee? I was approached by Masterworks about sponsoring a video. They allow you to invest in fine and contemporary art and we'll talk about them later. But they made me think about art again, about what I enjoy about art. They made me think about investing in art and then they made me think about what does investing in art in coffee mean? And the answer, to me, is actually pretty simple: it means vintage espresso machines. Something that I have loved from the moment that I got into coffee, the moment that I saw them, these old machines just appealed to me but I've never bought one and I've always wanted to. The idea of something old really appeals to me. There's something about the fact that 200 years ago this artist painted this canvas, this work right here. That's meaningful to me. And the idea of drinking coffee from a machine that's 50, 60 years old is also meaningful to me. And that brings me to Rimini because not far from here is the workshop of Enrico Maltoni. Now, Enrico is probably the foremost collector of vintage espresso machines in the world. You might know the MUMAC Museum of espresso machines in Milan, that's his collection, but out here he has his restoration workshop and we're gonna head there next. See him at work, talk to him about vintage espresso machines, how to buy them, what to look out for, is it a good investment? And maybe, just maybe, I can convince him to sell me something. So I've known about Enrico pretty much since I've worked in coffee, I don't really know what he's gonna have in his workshop. He obviously has all his collection at the museum, I'm hoping he has some fun stuff there, too. I dunno what we're gonna see but I am undeniably excited. So I'm here in Enrico Maltoni's workshop and I feel like a kid in a candy shop. This is, this is incredible. This place is incredible. I've come to ask some questions but I could shoot 10 different videos of all of the stuff he has squirreled away here. There's prototypes, there's things I've never seen before. I feel like I have to capture some extra stuff, but I wanna ask him questions. I wanna ask about buying old espresso machines. Now, Enrico doesn't speak English and that's okay, we've got some translation, but I want to interview him and understand his experience. Get some of his knowledge, learn a little bit more about the market for vintage espresso machines because I want one and I still don't really understand if this is a good idea. -  Is that the only machine with that group head style, where the portafilter moves up and down? - So what we're gonna do now is take the opportunity to open up a restored machine and see what they look like on the inside because the outside, obviously, is beautiful. This machine, I think from 1963, it's a Faema, I wanna know what it's like on the inside? I also just want to own this. With me to talk about this is Matteo who looks after the workshop here, he's in charge of all of the restoration stuff here, so let's take it to pieces. So, this piece is the one that we just took off the back of the machine before. This, there's a lot of restoration in this one piece, right? - In the restoration process which bit adds the most cost, you know what I mean, which adds the most expense in the whole build? - Okay. How long would this restoration have taken? - But, as far as the coffee is concerned, this machine is the same as it was when it was built, you know what I mean? If you're the puck of coffee, the temperature of the water, the way the whole machine works, is the same. - Yes. All right. Can we make coffee with this? I feel very nervous. I feel weirdly nervous to use this only 'cause I don't know what I'm doing and I don't really use lever machines very much. So, down? - Yes, pull down. Five seconds. - Okay. And then a little up and a little down? - Yes. - Like now? So, like here and down. - Okay, and up. - And up again and then let go? Oh, that looks pretty nice. This is actually a really important part of the whole experience for me, this is a rare experience and that changes the way the coffee tastes a little bit. It's not as much about the coffee and the blend right now as in the machine that made it that makes this memorable to me. Thank you. I need quite a lot of prep on how to use these things 'cause I have no idea. Now what is interesting, Enrico just told me, this is the first model that had \"crema caff\u00e8 naturale\" on the back. The first time that the term 'crema' was used for espresso and it was a redefinition of coffee this way. It's great marketing and it's a word we use all the time now. This machine, not this exact model or this exact unit, but when they started making this in the very late 40s, early 50s, this defined crema and I just think that's cool. I'm gonna try and make coffee with it. All right, so  feel good about life now. Click, five seconds, which feels about now? Now? - Yes, yes. - There we go. This is the taste of history and coffee. Oh dear. You know, there's no denying it, I really want one. I really, really want to own an old espresso machine. It may not be a sound financial decision. I'm not sure I can justify it as an investment even with the guidance of an expert like Enrico, but talking about investments does bring us to the sponsor of this video and it's, I guess, now time for a short ad about Masterworks. Now, Masterworks is a unique platform that let's you invest in fine and contemporary art, something that was pretty exclusive, pretty hard to get into until now. It lets you invest in a range of artists going from, say, Banksy through to Monet. Now we are talking about investments and so it's important to say, if you're investing your money your investments can go down as well as up and me talking about this does not constitute financial advice. But what Masterworks are doing is really interesting. Most people would tell you, most wealth managers would tell you, you should diversify your portfolio and this is definitely an interesting way to do that. In fact, if you look at the world of fine art, it's a growing world. More than that, I think fine and contemporary art in one study had outpaced the S&amp;P 500 by 164% from 1995 to 2021. It's been great here having access to an expert and Masterworks is the same, you're using their expertise in your investments, you're not going in blind and going in alone. If you're interested in Masterworks and you wanna gain priority access, then there's a link in the description down below. Thank you so much to Masterworks for sponsoring this video. Now I have to convince Enrico to sell me something. It's time to go shopping. Okay, I want one. I want something. And I think the thing is I don't just want something for home. What I have in mind, I wanna be able to serve coffee from this to lots of people. What have you got? - This one? - How much would something like this be? - Okay. Okay, that's, I don't know what I thought it was going to be. I don't know if I thought that was high or low but that seems very fair, actually, for something like this. Is there anything else you have? - Okay, let's go. - Mm, yes. - How long will this take to restore? - Okay. - How much? - Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah  -  How much? - That's nice. That's really nice, actually. You have a deal. - Sold. Okay, because I need to explain just to you watching, why would I buy this? It's not just - I'm not just buying a one group to keep at home for me. I have a plan. I want to share the experience of drinking coffee from an old machine and so that's why, that's why I was looking for maybe a two group or even a three group, but a two group is kind of perfect because I wanna put it in a cafe in a public space. The painful bit now is going to be waiting to see this transform. So we'll get a load of pictures now of it, so you can see the before and when you see it again in a future video you'll see the after, you'll see the restored version. And I'll tell you, if you're around London, maybe how you can drink some coffee from it. I've had an incredible day. I've had the most fun. And I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of all of the different things in this building. There's just so many parts, machines, things that are full of stories that I could do a whole video about just one of them, but there's no time. Today has been a successful day. I'm very excited. I go away, potentially the owner of a very beautiful thing. I can't wait. I'm very impatient.", "videoID": "6Kv1e00rCbc"}, {"title": "Drinking Georgia's Coffee Jelly", "text": "Today, we're going to look at something a little bit different about which I am honestly pretty excited. It's this, Georgia's Coffee Jelly. Now this was sent to me by a viewer in Hong Kong who didn't sign the letter that they put in with this. And unfortunately, I only realized that their name would have been on the return to sender section of the parcel after I threw the packaging away. So I don't know who you are to say thank you, but thank you for sending me this. Now you might think I'd be a little bit nervous to taste this because it's coffee jelly. But I aspire to having a heightened appreciation of the jelly texture. I know some people get kind of weirded out by jelly and there can be a bit of othering going on. I don't really feel like we get to throw stones at other cultures preferences for textures when, you know, my culture has spent a long time getting milk to go solid and rotting it just right. And that's delicious, so maybe we shouldn't decide what's weird. I'm excited to taste this. I'm into jelly textures, on the condition that you expect them. I think if you drink a drink and you don't think it's going to be a jelly, and it's jelly, that can be challenging. But if you're expecting a jelly, a good time can be had by all. Now, I don't know a ton about Georgia as a company. I know they're owned by Coca-Cola. The name is a reference to the state of Georgia, where Coca-Cola is based. They are more successful in Japan than anywhere else, they do a bunch of canned coffee stuff. But they do this coffee jelly, which I'm supposed to invert I think five times, some people say six, seven, so we'll give it a little... It sounds interesting. It sounds fairly solid. I'm not sure that coffee taste is going to be great, but this is just too exciting. Okay! It's got a lot of chocolate smell to it, you know what I mean? Like when coffee does chocolate, but not. I don't think there's chocolate in it, isn't it? Okay, in terms of content, slightly surprising. We've got water, sugar, coffee, good. Whole milk, confusing. So whole milk powder and skim milk powder, and dextrin, and flavors, and jelling agent, which in this case is polysaccharide, so it's vegetarian, obviously not vegan. Sodium caseinate, anti-caking, sweetener, ooh, sweetener and sugar. Okay, I expect some sweetness here. Let's see what we get. This is going to be so much fun. It smells, it doesn't smell bad, sort of. This is, I don't know what I expected. There's a really interesting sort of contrast here between the milky coffee, I presume, and then the gelatinous coffee. And the colors look pretty different, but maybe the jelly is the same as the liquid? Very light chocolaty essence, bitter coffee, the coffee that's going to turn up, I'm not hopeful for it. Let's drink some jelly! The texture is pretty great. It's a really interesting jelly, it's quite clean. It's not rubbery at all. Do you know what kills me about this drink? If this was made with better coffee, I'd be kind of into it. It's just not got great coffee taste. You know, it's definitely kind of a watery, soft jelly. Breaks apart very easily, it's very, very clean. I don't feel like there's a lot of fat in there, so there's obviously a little bit from the whole milk powder, but not a lot. It is sweet. It's very sweet. It's sort of, distractingly sweet, as is normal. I kind of want to do a version of this myself now. I'm really intrigued by it. I'm intrigued, I don't know whether the sort of paler, milkier-looking liquid is like a separate liquid that they load in alongside the jelly. I feel like I have so many questions about it. I can't imagine that when that jelly melts, it goes the color of the creamy liquid. It's kind of, hang on a second, let me just try the liquid on its own. Really does feel like they put chocolate flavor on that, let me just try some jelly. I'm a terrible hypocrite because I'm probably a loud eater, but I can't stand the sound of people eating. So I'm enjoying this, but I would hate to sit next to somebody who is enjoying this and have to listen to that, so, you know. It's pretty good, I can see how people would get sort of like, \"Ah, jelly,\" but you should try jelly drinks. I'm kind of into it. It's nice and cold. I just wish the coffee flavor wasn't so bad. It doesn't taste like robust or anything, it doesn't taste like low-grown coffee, this tastes a little dark roasted. It's just not, it's not a joyful coffee flavor, you know? It's not the best that coffee can be, and I've said that before, but it is a running theme in a lot of these kinds of drinks. That was a surprisingly good time in many ways, I'm kind of into jelly textures, I'm into the idea of drinking jelly. I had some very nice lychee-flavored jelly drinks over the years that I've liked a lot. I don't like the flavor of this though, and I think it's not the worst canned coffee drink I've had, certainly not the worst from Japan by a long way.", "videoID": "qR0EkZtWscc"}, {"title": "My Current Daily Driver\uff1a Hario Switch + Sibarist", "text": "Today I wanna do something a little bit different. Think of this as my daily driver but for coffee. It's the brewing method that I'm using right now. Something that I'm favoring right now. It's not the best brew method, it's not the ultimate brew method. It's just something that I'm enjoying and in this one, it led me to an experiment that I think is worth sharing that I think is super interesting too. So right now I am brewing a lot with this is, it's Hario's switch. It's Hario's answer to the Clever coffee dripper. Now the Clever I've been using a lot at home because I'm trying to work on my brew guide for the Clever. And one of the challenges with this brewer is the drawdown time. Now the way it works is very simple. You put a filter paper in, you put coffee and water in, you let it steep, because at the bottom, there's a little stopper that only opens when you put it on a cup and then it drains out. I really like steep and release brewers, I like them a lot. This combination of infusion at the start where the coffee and water just hangs out together with this kind of percolation paper separation phase. I just like the end results a lot. Now in my research and testing, I thought it would be interesting to compare the Clever to the Hario's switch. Now the way that works is a little bit different to how the Clever works. This has a kind of metal ball bearing, acting as a kind of stopper right at the bottom. When you push the switch, it pops the ball bearing up and your coffee drains out. But really, it is a glass V60 in the base here and I thought that was interesting to test. But it led me to test with other filter papers to try and find faster draw downs. And that led me to an interesting result. I know you probably have questions about this jumper, you are gonna have to wait to the end of the video for that. To illustrate my point, to start us off. I'm gonna brew a simple brew with this thing using the tabbed bagged Hario filters. I think that's a good benchmark. And I'll talk you through how I brew the switch. It is different so far into how I'm brewing the Clever so it's not a kinda one for one here. I'll be brewing 15 grams of coffee to 250 grams of water, and I'd be running a two minute steep a little stir and a drain. Let's do that now. Now I kind of do a bloomer phase at the moment, which is just add two to one, and then give it a little swirl just to kind of get rid of any pockets of dry coffee before I infuse as a whole. Now as I said, I do like infusion brewing, you can just let coffee and water steep and you're not worried about evenness of extraction. As long as all of the coffee is kind of getting wet, there's no pockets of dry coffee anywhere, you're having a pretty even extraction. And that's good because with percolation like a pour over, or espresso, you're worried about evenness, you're worried about channeling, all of those things are a concern. Generally I've been grinding pretty fine for this. Just a little bit finer in some cases than kind of my cupping setting because I've been sort of steeping for just two minutes before beginning the drawdown process. What I'll do then, I'll give it a little stir one way or the other like in a V60, and then I'll drain it out. I'll flip the switch and away we'll go. So with this and actually the drawdown is pretty fast and then it begins to slow down and almost choke a little bit. And you think it's gonna take 30 seconds to drain but it doesn't, it takes much, much longer than that. And what's likely happening is very fine particles are plugging the filter paper up making it difficult for the liquid to pass through. And I had wondered if that's the case, how much of the problem is the paper versus the bed? If this could happen faster would it still taste really good? So we're done. That is a about a two minute 10 drawdown phase, we're at a sort of four minutes 25 total brew time, which is a pretty long slow brew time. And there's something about a slow drawdown that's just infuriating to me. It's just maddening to watch this thing happened very slowly. But if I wanted that bit to go faster. Well, the question I had to answer was how much extraction am I doing in the infusion phase and how much am I doing in the percolation phase? So what I'll need to do is replicate this brew, but skip the second stage. Lemme do that now. Everything just the same, 250 grams, and a two minutes steep. And as before, at two minutes I'll give it that little stir. I'll let it rest for sort of 15 seconds to have some of that bed fall to the bottom. And then I'm gonna make a terrible mess. I've never done this without making a mess, so I'm just accepting at this point. What I'm gonna do is try and decant the liquid from the top of this, through this V60 paper here to sort of, you know, clarify it a little bit to strain out whatever fines are suspended in there, but sort of skip the step where it flows through the bed. So wish me luck. And it's about normal. So you can see here, there's the bed that we're trying to avoid, nice and flat. One should note at the bottom there, which is good. And a terrible mess as usual. While this drains I'll clean this up and we're be back in just a second. So we now have two brews, we've got the regular immersion plus percolation phase and then we've got the just immersion phase with a little bit of straining happening there, just to get rid of the fines and that kind of stuff. These we can then test and measure to see the difference, both with tasting, which I think is very important, but also, with one of these, it's a refractometer. This measures the speed of light through coffee, or more usefully gives you a refractive index of the liquid, it tells us how much stuff is dissolved in the coffee liquid and we can calculate back from that how much of the ground coffee we extracted into the liquid that we're gonna drink. So a little stir. You do wanna stir your filter coffee if you're testing it much like you wanna stir your espresso. If you don't know what I'm talking about, there's a video up here. You can take a drop, place on the center. And away we test. And the absolute number is not super important here. Yes, this is a percentage that suggests a good extraction but that's not really the point. The point is the difference between the two. So here, about 1.35, it's coming up pretty consistently. Let's compare it to the other one. Oh, big difference. Huge difference, actually. Now you might argue that 0.3 is not a huge difference of anything, but it turns out in brewed coffee that is a big difference. But let's taste them. Is this a wild variation? That is very nice. That is very well extracted, super balanced. Nice clarity, nice acidity. It's yummy basically. This based on this should be pretty bad. And it's not great. But it's so, it's so much better than it should be. It's so much better than it should be. If you brewed a V60 and produced that strength and had that extraction, it would taste really bad. This doesn't, this has some texture and body and mouthfeel. It just feels a bit empty. I'm increasingly of the belief that there is something particularly useful about infusion brews for having what feels like a nice texture, nice mouthfeel to your coffee very easily. I think this kind of makes sense of those moments when someone grinds quite costly for a French press, but still has a pretty good result. I think something about the infusion brewing that has a kind of tolerance of grind size that can kinda quite easily get you to something pretty good. I think that's interesting. But this cup is, it is unquestionably better, right. There's no question at all in my mind. This is more complex, sweeter, more enjoyable, better finish, everything about it is better. This is just surprisingly not bad. It's just not great either, though. So now I wanna talk about the Sibarist papers. These are really interesting, I actually made a very rare patreon only video comparing these and a few other kinda third party V60 filters, so I have looked at them before. But they are fast flow filters. They allow coffee to drain through the paper much quicker by being more porous. When you brew with these you get a little bit of sediment in the cup. They're closer to a very fine metal filter than they are paper in some ways, kinda halfway house between those two. Like a fine metal filter and a paper filter, that's where they are. They don't do the clarity of cloth, but they still taste kind of like a paper filter. They're really interesting. They're also really expensive. And I'm also aware, the Hario switch is a little bit expensive. And I'm very lucky that I can play with these. And I hope my experiments yield some interesting learning. So I should acknowledge that these are expensive, both the brewer and the papers. Before a brew with these though, and talk about why I think it's so interesting. There's a couple things to take care of. Firstly, this video has an ad on it, which means it also has a grinder giveaway. Right now for every sponsored video, I'm giving away five Baratza encores.

And we're done. A little bit under 45 seconds, which is, which is pretty fast. Now this leaves me with a whole bunch of questions. If this drains really fast, are we missing out on contact time? Are we reducing our contact time and therefore dramatically reducing our extraction? For 45 seconds, it's nearly a minute and a half faster as a brewer or shorter as a brew than with the regular Hario papers. What's that gonna do? And also, if these papers are more porous am I likely to see some bypass happening? Is liquid flowing out of the paper because it can quite easily instead of down through the bed? Is that gonna drop my extraction lot as well? There's only one way to find out. Let's measure it. Now like I said, this does have a little bit more sediment in the brew. So having stirred it, I'm gonna just decant a little bit through a new paper, just to clarify it and take out any of that sediment. I don't need much liquid, but I do need to strain it properly to get a good refractive index reading. Alright, let's get a little sample droplet here. It is, it seems lower, but barely any lower. That additional contact time didn't dramatically increase our extraction, which is kind of notable. And if there is some bypass happening, well it's not really damaging to the brewery overall. How's the taste? Yeah, very good. It does have that nice immersion extraction profile that I really like. It's just very tasty, nice clarity, nice acidity. Would I go a little bit finer? I might actually just to kinda bring it to a more balanced extraction point or something closer to the Hario paper. It would need maybe one tiny notch finer on a grinder. I really wouldn't worry about this longer brew time from a finer grinder or a longer drawdown because these drawdowns are so fast because of these papers. And so you get I think a great result from a very enjoyable brew method. It's kinda easy to dial in. You get this nice emulsion percolation combination. You can go pretty fine, get pretty high extractions, get great tasting cups of coffee, that happen pretty quickly. And I don't mind a little tiny bit of sediment in my cup. I don't mind that at all actually. It still tastes pretty clean. There's still some nice fresh crisp acidity to the cup if that's what you're into. I'm a little bit impressed. And again I will say they are expensive. I know they're expensive to buy. They're a new company starting up doing a new thing that can often mean what you're doing is more expensive. I hope they grow, I'm kinda into what they're doing. I don't wanna use Sibarist for everything, and sometimes I do want more clarity and more filtration than they offer. But I do like using them as a kind of steep and release filter in this particular setup with the switch. Would I recommend exactly the same thing for my Clever? No I'd recommend a slightly different thing but I will make a video about that very soon. I do really like the Clever dripper as a brew tool 'cause it is so cheap, so easy to use, and it makes great coffee, but that's for another time. I did say I would tell you about this delightful Christmas jumper and now is the time. Per 10 100,000 we decided we would do an ugly coffee Christmas jumper. We worked with artists Michael B Myers on kind of pixel art, so you have everything from like an AeroPress, to a drip pot, a takeaway cup, pour overs, wagner kettles, latte art. This isn't a snowflake, this is a coffee flour. There's portafilters on my sleeves. These are knitted to order. So this isn't printed this is actually knitted and they are a single run. Once they're gone, they're gone.", "videoID": "QjIvN8mlK9Y"}, {"title": "Product Review\uff1a The Ember Smart Mug", "text": "Today, we're gonna be reviewing The Ember Smart Mug. And I'll warn you now, this review might induce a little bit of outrage. So, why would this product or this review make you a little bit angry? Well, let's start with a few things. This is a smart mug. It connects to your phone via Bluetooth. It costs pretty much 80 pounds. One of the first things that I did after getting this was connect it to my phone, and update the firmware on my coffee cup. Now, all of those things do make this seem completely ridiculous. I'm gonna top it all, I really like it. Let's explain a little bit more about what this does, and why it does it and why on earth I think that this is actually quite a good product. So, the way this mug works, it is a smart mug, it has a battery in the base, as well as an element and a thermometer. And you tell it what temperature you want your coffee to be. You put your coffee in the cup, and it will cool to your desired temperature. It'll notify you that it's your desired temperature, and it will hold it at that temperature. That seems a little bit ridiculous, and I can already hear you telling me how nice it is when coffee cools down, and you can enjoy all the flavors all the more, and letting coffee cool is a good thing, and why would you wanna heat it? And don't thermoses already exist? And what is wrong with me, why would I spend 80 pounds of my own money on a coffee cup like this? Those are all valid questions. And frankly, I was a little skeptical of this at the start. I put out on Twitter to see if anyone had one, what their experiences were and was somewhat surprised when there was a universal positive response to it. And at that point I had to pull the trigger, I had to buy one. And I'll be honest, owning one of these will mean that your colleagues, friends and loved ones will mock you mercilessly for owning an incredibly expensive smart mug that holds coffee at a particular temperature of your choosing. So I'll give you the moment where this went from being an amusing novelty, an excess of the internet of things to being something that I was quite grateful to have on my desk. Now this, I think this has a specific audience which are people who often work at desks and are easily distracted by stuff and that's me. I'll be honest, I often work at a desk, not always but I am very easily distracted by lots of different things. Let me set the scene. I sat at my desk, someone came in and poured me a mug full of filter coffee. And it was a preview roaster, kind of a test development rose to be new coffee that I was pretty excited to taste and they wanted some feedback on it and it was too hot to drink, I was working away and then I got called out of where I was working to go and do some other stuff. And it took way longer than I expected, 10, 15 minutes. And I came back and I sat down and I was a little sad 'cause I'd missed really that kind of peak moment for capturing flavor notes, where it's not hot, but it's certainly not cold. And yet I reached across, grab my cup, and there it was this perfect temperature cup of coffee just sat waiting for me. It had not particularly degraded in the 10 or 15 minutes that I've been gone even though it had been actively heated but it had been very gently, very lightly heated. It tasted great, I really enjoyed it. And I had this moment of like, wow, I'm grateful to own this. Now this is, I know this is a little absurd, it's all a little absurd. I kind of get why people who buy these come to really like them. Now, if you're someone who has the time and space and energy and work flow in your life to brew a delicious cup of coffee, to sit down, to focus on it, capture it at it's perfect moment in time and temperature and enjoy it, I envy you. I am not that person, I live a life full of distractions. So it's all too easy for me to miss my favorite moment. And that's kind of sad. Now this has sort of saved that more than enough times in a week for me to feel like this was a good idea. Now, this really is only gonna live on my desk, it's battery powered, right? So the way it works is it charges on this little source of type thing that is plugged into a wall socket. So I suspect this doesn't live in people's houses really, I suspect this lives where people work. It lasts I think a couple of hours, depending on how hot you want your coffee to stay. There's a little chart that they give you when you buy one of these. So, you know, I'm generally trying to keep my coffee around the very early fifties in terms of degrees Celsius. I can't do the other, you know, temperature. I'm just not into it. I'm just not, I'll say it now. I can't do Fahrenheit. I just can't do it. So this sits 50, 52, 54 if I'm feeling like I need a little bit more warmth in my coffee. And I get it, I get that if you saw me with this, would want to tease me and you should, and that's okay. You should absolutely tease anyone who spent that much money on one of these but they're also having a kind of a good time with it. It's hot. You know, I'm just deeply, I'm troubled by this. I'm troubled by it. Let's not say that this is a flawless product. Let's talk through a few issues that I have with this thing. And the most obvious one, I think to just about anyone aside from the price, 'cause it is expensive is the way that it charges. Now, it's pretty simple. There is a two rings here that meet two contactors. So it doesn't matter which way around you have the mug, you don't have to have it in a certain position as long as just on the base. Now this nature of charging means that this is not dishwasher safe. Now I'm sort of stunned that they didn't go for charging or something like it, and they went through these contactors because not making this dishwasher safe, seems like a massive error. People have put these through dishwashers and they have survived. It will certainly be fine with a hand-wash. It just seems like a weird design decision. Second thing, you actually lose a reasonable amount of capacity in the mug to the battery and the heating unit. So it looks like a decent sized mug but it's actually quite a bit smaller on the inside than you think it is. Capacity is not a huge issue for me. It's that moment where I pick it up and I think I have more coffee than I do, and then I find I don't and I'm sad. I don't like to feel sad over things as stupid as not having enough coffee in my coffee cup. So it will trick you now and again into thinking it's fuller than it is. This one's black, so when you look in the top, that doesn't really help you either. Now, finally, this hasn't happened to me. I haven't had this long enough, but I have read that some people possibly with earlier models had issues with the inside coating flaking off. As I said, that hasn't happened to me but it is something that I will be paying attention to and worrying about. Inevitably, there's an app and the app is a little over-engineered. I'm not gonna lie, I do quite like having a little notification appear to tell me that my coffee is the perfect temperature to drink and the control wheel inside to choose my temperature is very simple to use. It does offer you some more presets. You can do coffee consumption tracking, I don't care about any of that stuff. And so here we are, The Ember Mug. It's ridiculous, it's ridiculous. You're looking at this and you're thinking that's ridiculous and you're right, but that doesn't mean I can't like it or that you wouldn't like it too. Is this the single best way you can invest 80 pounds or in the US $80 on your coffee experience? No, no, it's probably not. Does it meet the needs of every person? Not even slightly, but if you, like me, often are distracted, really really love coffee and kind of wanna experience that kind of sweet spot for as long as possible, this is a solution and I'm not sure there's a better solution out there. I have come to accept that the usefulness of thermoses is pretty limited. They keep things incredibly hot to the point that that drives me kind of insane when I've driven all the way to the airport and I still can't drink my coffee. So maybe there's a middle ground. Now they do a travel version of this which is an intense amount of money. It's like 150 pounds. That is way too much money. I am not spending that kind of money on a travel cup. That's just not happening, but on this little mug, well, I've spent it now, it's too late, I'm committed. And maybe, you know, that's clouding my review but I had been surprised and a little bit delighted at the ridiculousness and the wonderfulness of The Ember mug. If you have one of these, I do wanna hear from you. Am I alone in this? Let me know in the comments if you are watching this and thinking, this is the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard, give it a thumbs up.", "videoID": "8pPCMjqI_uw"}, {"title": "The Ultimate AeroPress Technique (Episode #3)", "text": "In this video, I'm gonna be talking through my recommended AeroPress technique. Now this is a technique that I think will be a great default technique. You may want to vary from this, you might want to do other things. I would recommend exploring the world of AeroPresses but this is a technique designed to do sort of the least amount necessary to get to fantastic coffee reliably every single time. A technique designed to set you up for success whenever you brew coffee with your AeroPress. So let's start at the beginning with the recipe or ratio that I would recommend and this, immediately, has a little bit of choice. I'm using a light roasted coffee and I like a high extraction here that will give me quite a strong cup with a lower ratio. So I'm using 55 grams per liter or in this brew: 11 grams to 200 grams of water. Darker roasts, you may not want to extract to the same extent so I might recommend 60 or 65 grams a liter and not extracting quite as much from it. In terms of setting up your AeroPress, not much to do. Pull your plunger out, put a paper into the paper holder, there's no need to rinse your filter paper here, pop it in, lock it in and place it on top of whatever you're gonna brew into. You don't have to brew into a carafe. You can brew into a mug, cup, whatever you like as long as it's pretty sturdy 'cause you're gonna be pressing on it in a second. Now, let's talk about grind size. For this brew, I'm actually grinding really pretty fine, finer that I would even brew for, say, a pour over. So getting a little bit closer to that kind of nearly espresso range. If you're using a medium or darker roasted coffee, you may not want to grind this fine. It will certainly increase your extraction and strength but it may not taste good. So there's no one answer on grind size here. I'm gonna load this coffee into the AeroPress and I'm gonna boil my water. Now, one more note on water temperature. Again, with lighter roasts, you can go all the way up to boiling and I would recommend that, however, for medium or darker roasts, I would drop my temperature the darker the roast is. For a really dark roast, I'd be brewing even under 90 degrees Celsius, down maybe at 85. For a medium roast, 90 to 95 might be a sweet spot if you have a temperature-controlled kettle. Start your timer then you're gonna add 200 grams of water. Try and get the coffee wet as quickly as you can as you pour and if it's all wet just pour in the middle and get up to 200 grams or whatever ratio you're using. Now, you don't have to use a pour over kettle like this one, a gooseneck kettle. You can use a regular kettle, you could use a pot that you boiled on the stove; it doesn't really matter. It's just about getting the water in and getting all the coffee nice and evenly saturated. Obviously we're gonna move this off our scale, we're not gonna press on the scale, there's no need for that and we're just gonna wait for two minutes. Here's one I started earlier. When you get to two minutes what we're gonna do is start to swirl and it's gonna be a very gentle swirl. Make sure that you're holding both the piston and the base of the unit and just give it a gentle swirl. That's it. You're not trying to create a vortex in there. You're just trying to gently knock the ground coffee that's formed a crust down so it starts to sink to the bottom and then you're gonna wait for about 30 seconds and then you're gonna start to press. Now when it comes to pressing, I would recommend being relatively gentle. You shouldn't be leaning into this. You should be able to do it comfortably with your body away from the AeroPress. So not pressing too hard at all. Press gently, press evenly and once you've waited 30 seconds you're gonna press all the way until you've pressed every drop of greatness out of this press, down into the carafe or the cup below. For a 200 ml brew for this grind size, that takes me about 30 seconds. Once you've pressed pull back just a little bit, that'll help prevent drips, turn it upside down. Obviously you can clean up now, pop the coffee out, give it a rinse, give it a clean, reset for the next day and you've got, I hope, a great cup of coffee. Now, if it's not a great cup of coffee, again, it's gonna be the grind size and maybe the temperature that you're gonna tweak. If you've got too much bitterness in your cup, chances are you might have ground a bit fine or brewed a bit hot for the coffee that you're using. If you've got a bit of sourness in your cup, well, the opposite. Feel free to get to maximum temperature and try grinding a little bit finer. Now this, I think, gets you to a great cup of coffee in the simplest, neatest way possible with no additional unnecessary steps but it's not the one way to brew the AeroPress. So down below, I've linked to a bunch of other AeroPress recipes. If you want something that is your kind of daily driver, your regular brew method, I hope this is it but if you wanna play and explore and have some fun with an AeroPress which I think is kind of half the point then I would recommend checking out how other people use it. Explore those recipes. They're all linked in the description box down below but now I wanna hear from you.", "videoID": "j6VlT_jUVPc"}, {"title": "Coffee BBQ Sauce Shouldn\u2019t Be This Good", "text": "Today, we're go talk about coffee barbecue sauce, which I know might be controversial for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I did make a video called Stop Putting Coffee in Stuff and this feels perhaps hypocritical, but I would argue, coffee barbecue sauce actually is a thing, it has been a thing for a while and it is worth talking about from the perspective of good coffee, right? That's the overview, that's the idea of this video. It's not just people just ramming coffee into barbecue sauce, hopefully, it's a bit more nuanced, there's a kind of idea behind it. I wanna have a little look at it anyway. And secondly, there's the idea that I might act as if I have something definitive to say about barbecue. I don't, I'm not gonna give you an ultimate recipe of any kind. I know nothing about barbecue in the great scheme of things and people have very strong opinions, people are very passionate about barbecue, and I'm not gonna come over here and tell you how to make a barbecue sauce. But I do wanna look at coffee barbecue sauce and see what lessons can be learned from the good coffee perspective, right? That's the idea here. If you wanna do this, if you wanna make a coffee barbecue sauce, what's the best way to get coffee into it? What's the best way to have coffee shine as an ingredient? That's the question I'm most interested in answering because often, people just cram the worst version of coffee into stuff, and that makes me mad, but can we get a good version of good coffee into barbecue sauce? Now, what I've got here are four commercially available coffee barbecue sauces because I need a kind of benchmark. I wanna see what people think coffee does in these sauces, how they're getting it in there. There's a bunch of different approaches here, so it just seemed sensible to have a little taste, set some benchmark before I head to the kitchen and experiment. Three of these are from the US, one is from the UK. This is Black Dust Coffee &amp; Spice, Small Batch Barbecue Sauce. All of these seem to be very traditional ketchup-based sauces, probably quite sweet, a little smoky. There'll be a bunch of cumin in all of them, I suspect. Now, this one has ground coffee in it. So, I'm kind of curious to see what that does. I'm not a huge fan of ground coffee in my mouth as that kind of texture thing, but hey, let's give it a try. The coffee here is more present as a texture actually than as a flavor. There's very strong tomato, acid, sugar, all up front first. Coffee is really pretty subtle, dominated by the smoke. A little heat, not too much. It's a pleasant sauce, but not strongly coffee. Now, the next one is from a Meat Co Lab. It's Dirty Barbie Espresso and Bourbon Barbecue Sauce. This is from the UK. A little smokier, a little less vinegar on the nose. So this, very sweet, not much coffee at all. Really quite subtle, maybe adding a little bit of kind of earthiness in that regard, but certainly not an obvious coffee presence in this sauce. Much sweeter, not much bourbon either. That's not a complaint, it's nice, it's just quite sweet for me. Let's move on. Now, this comes from the Roasterie in Kansas City. This looks, again, like ground coffee has gone in there. Let's have a look. Espresso grounds and cocoa powder, interesting. So, they're really going for that kind of a Maillardy flavor spectrum, I guess. Oh, that's quite different. Now, that smells like more of a dark roast to me. Again, pretty sweet, a nice little bit of heat, pretty nice balance. There's this deep kind of heavy base to this sauce that's kind of interesting, that I think is that kind of chocolate, coffee, like darker roast heavy sort of a thing. Definitely an interesting sauce, just like a much richer bassier kind of sauce overall. Last up is a Coffee Barbecue Sauce from Torchbearer Sauces. So, the interesting thing about this sauce is that number one on the ingredients list is fresh brewed coffee. That is the primary component of this sauce. I'm intrigued by this one. This feels like a... Should be a very coffee-forward sauce. But let's have a look. And it's still got some thickness to it. Okay, there's definitely coffee there. Some nice heat coming in, coming in strong. Yeah, nicely spicy. Okay. This one is by far the most interesting to me because you can see what the coffee is doing. Like it's really, it's the centerpiece of the sauce and everything else kind of bolts on the side of it, whereas these feel like tomato-based sauces, ketchup-based sauces, that have a little coffee kind of woven through it. That is interesting. Now, that's quite spicy and if you're gonna use it as a mop sauce, you're gonna put a lot of this on there, I guess. So, that would be a spicy affair, but it's interesting to taste coffee at the heart of things. So, what I'm gonna do now is this, I'm gonna go and make a pretty simple basic sauce that's very similar to these ones here and then add coffee to it in four different ways. We're gonna add it as ground coffee, we're gonna add it as specialty instant coffee, we're gonna add it as espresso coffee and we're gonna add it as brewed coffee. Now, each of those will have a slightly different effect on the sauce, but I'll be interested to see which way of adding coffee lets it shine in and amongst the other ingredients and what we can learn from doing it. Let's go. So, I have here four sauces that are the result of today's experiment and the base of them is all the same, right? So as I said, I put together a very simple tomato ketchup-based barbecue sauce. And I know you would have a lot of opinions about what's the right sauce, anything like that, but I wanted something that tasted like barbecue sauce that was pretty neutral tasty that I could kind of let the coffee do its thing in to understand how coffee changed that kind of thing. But you can see how it was made, put together super simply, cooked down a little bit, not too much, just like five minutes on the hub, I think, was plenty, but four different iterations of coffee. One of them, we used some instant coffee. We used about three and a half grams of specialty instant that I quite like, as a specialty instance go. There's about three grounds, I think, of soluble material in there. So, that was that one. Two, to match that, I put about 10 grams of kind of flour-fine ground coffee into one, which was really interesting. Now, that's a bit more soluble material, I know, but sort of it was a best guess. But that was definitely weird, that the coffee just soaked up the moisture really quickly and surprisingly if I thought about it, but interesting nonetheless. So, that one's not gonna be difficult to find in the blind tasting. Then we took some espresso and we added that in. So, like 18 to 36 as a kind of brew recipe. That went in about three grams of soluble material and then a strong cup of coffee brewed on the switch at a hundred grams a liter, kind of a mocker pot ratio for kind of strong coffee. And then, that sauce had to be cooked down a little bit more to sort of reduce it to the similar sort of texture of the others here. And then, these have all been mixed up, even though I can tell one very easily, the other three, a little bit more of a challenge. Color, there's more variance with the exception of one, but what about taste? Which way is the best way to get coffee into barbecue sauce? Let's have a taste. That's pretty good. That's doing what I think coffee should be doing in a barbecue sauce, which is just kind of rounding things out, giving some nice base to it. Really the heat, the spice is the kind of dominant physical feeling, slightly balanced off by the bitterness of the coffee and a little acidity from the vinegar. That's pretty good. Let's try this one. This one is not bad. The coffee is there, it's a little bit more subtle and actually a little bit more bitter, but it's not bad, it's just not as good as this one here. That one has to be the one that we cooked for awhile 'cause it's got that kind of cooked down hot plate coffee taste to it. The coffee is definitely a distraction, rather than an addition to the sauce. Lastly, well, this is the ground coffee one, obviously. I'm not gonna surprise anyone with that. I'll hear your argument that I put too much coffee and ground too finely, but if it was less coffee or coarsely ground or whatever else, the way that it's added flavor is fundamentally not good. It's bad. I don't think putting ground coffee in the sauce is remotely, remotely a good idea.

Okay, let's go in reverse order, starting with the worst one. Yap, no surprises, that was the one we added ground coffee to. That was terrible. That's one of the worst things I've ever made. That's really bad. I apologize for its existence, frankly. This is what I thought it was, which is the filter coffee, the kind of strong filter coffee. It just tastes cooked, you know what I mean? Like hot plate, cooked, bad, harsh, wrong. What's this one? Now, this was the instant, which is interesting. That wasn't in any way bad 'cause the instant's quite good. It worked quite well. I think it just needed a little bit more. It's interesting though that this one know, by kind of default, is the best one, that's the espresso. I'm troubled by this idea, but this might actually be better than the sauce without the coffee and that's kind of terrifying to me, but interesting, makes it definitely worth trying, definitely worth trying. Now, this is interesting because it doesn't have really that much more soluble material, it doesn't have that much more flavor of coffee in it than the instant, but maybe the flavor benefits from being fresh and not having been freeze dried. It was cooked a little bit after the coffee was added just to reduce it a little bit more, but it doesn't seem to have particularly damaged the flavor of it and that, I think, works really well. That's an espresso roast, but it's not a dark roast, it's a sort of on the cusp of medium, I guess, roast for espresso. In the world of modern specialty, it's medium. But I think it just adds really nice roundness and base. Now, I'm sort of annoyed that this is the winner because having an espresso machine is an annoying requirement to do this. So, I would say, if you wanna spend a little bit of money on a decent specialty instant, that is certainly one to consider. I wouldn't cheap out on the instant and use that because I think that's just gonna add bad flavor and very easily bad flavor can destroy everything here. So, definitely stick to good quality specialty coffee, but you can get it to come through and have some of that complexity of great coffee, some of the pleasant characteristics of just that tickle a bit in this, just that nice kind of sweet coffee flavor and have it pair with barbecue sauce really nicely. But now, I wanna hear from you. Have you tried to make it a coffee barbecue sauce? Will you try to make a barbecue sauce? What base would you use? What is your go-to barbecue sauce that you might wanna put some espresso in? Just reduce a little bit down just to get that consistency, unless I guess you wanted to use it as like a mop sauce and then you could go a little bit more kind of watery, I guess.", "videoID": "y3HTpZAtD4I"}, {"title": "The Best Home Coffee Brewing Machine", "text": "Hi there. Today, we're gonna look at these, little home batch brewers, little automatic coffee makers. Is one of these better? Does it make better coffee? Is it a more enjoyable experience to use? That's the question we're gonna ask here. Now, I've got six brewers. I wanted seven, but I could only get six. And I'll talk you through what I've got. First up on the end here, the Technivorm. Classic brewer, had to be included. Great design, beautiful brewer, but how does it brew in comparison to the others? This costs 230 pounds in the UK. Now, often I'll review Wilfa products that make people very cross in the U.S. because they can't buy them. You know, the other way with this one. This is the Oxo nine cup brewer. It's $210 and they only build it for North America. You cannot buy this outside of North America, but I really wanted to test this, having heard a lot about it. Next up is the Sage or Breville Precision Brewer. It's the same thing. In the UK, it's 250 pounds. I've reviewed this in full on the channel in the past. It's back again. Next up is the latest Wilfa brewer. So, you know, the reverse of the Oxo. This is available in Europe. It's not available in the U.S. This is a little bit more expensive at 285 pounds. Now the cheapest brewer here is the Behmor. It's the Brazen Plus 3.0. And that was 150 pounds in the UK. And last up on the end here, by far the most expensive, is the Ratio Six. Now in the UK, that is 375 pounds, nearly a hundred pounds more expensive than anything else here. This is also the European version that has the conical basket, not the flat basket inside it. That just seems worth bringing up right at the start. What I'll do now is I'll clear some space for myself, and I'll tell you how testing today is going to work. So I'm gonna break down the testing into different sections and cover different bits. And I've done a lot of testing before the video. There'll be a little bit during the video, too. So first thing is we did some temperature and extraction testing. So this was pretty simple. We put two temperature probes into the machine. One right into the shower heads of each of the machines to detect the temperature of the water coming out. And then out of interest, I left a probe in the coffee bed. That's actually less useful than I thought it was gonna be for a few different reasons. We're really gonna talk about the exit temperature of the water when it comes to each machine. And then we did a very simple extraction test. If we give each machine the same amount of water and the same weight of coffee at the same grind setting, and then just have them brew, how does their own way of brewing impact extraction? Do some extract notably more than others? And also we tracked their brew times. How long was water in contact for? And there were some pretty big differences. So I'll talk you through those machine by machine in just a second. After that, a few simple tests. The tank accuracy test. Trust me, it's a thing, The carafe test, because they all have carafes and I have opinions about carafes. And then we'll do a blind test test, just for kind of interest as much as anything else. And then we'll wrap up with a kind of overview of the UX/UI, features, what you get for your money, what works, what doesn't work, what makes me cross, what delights me. And at the end of all this, hopefully we know which one is, maybe not necessarily the best, but the best one for you. The one that meets your needs, be it budget, be it features, be it coffee quality. So first up, let's talk about the Technivorm. Now the Technivorm is one of three brewers that use very similar technology. It's the sort of heat loop displacement system inside this. Cold water goes in, is heated up. And as the water is heated and steam is formed, it's pushed out and up and over the coffee. This sort of system is used in very cheap brewers, but can be done well or done badly. And in this case, it's done pretty well. Though what was interesting to me in watching this was how long it took to get up to the final temperature. So it's a fairly slow creep up to temperature. If you look at the chart, you can sort of see the pulses happening. And you'll see it took about 30 seconds from starting to brew to getting up to those kinds of higher temperatures of the upper nineties in terms of degrees Celsius. And there it sits quite comfortably. When it's brewing water is coming out of the little spout here at about 97, 98 degrees Celsius, which I think is a good thing. Now, this kind of tech is very simple, robust. This brewer itself has been around for a long time. It's been refined a little bit, but it is just kind of go. That's it, you've got no control here. You just brew. Now we did measure extraction. I don't want to get into numbers, extraction being what percentage of the ground coffee that we put in the basket ended up in the cup of below. And in theory, the higher the extraction for a fixed grind size and a fixed kind of recipe, then the more even or effectively the brewer is extracting coffee. This did a very good job. This extracted pretty high compared to most of the other brewers. It certainly wasn't on the lower end of things. So from an extraction perspective, it did very well. And it did it in a fairly rapid time. It's a 3 1/2 minute brew time. It seems to me that the water comes out with enough force to create a little agitation, which really helps bump it's extraction up. So the way the Oxo brewed was really interesting. Again, similar technology of the kind of displacement going on around the heating element, but it brewed very differently to say the Technivorm. If you look at the temperature chart, you can see that it has periods of brewing. It has a kind of bloom phase, and then it stops. Then it has a kind of brew phase, then it stops. And then it kind of brews again. Temperature wise, yeah, very consistent, very stable. There's a bit of creep overall toward the end where everything gets just a little bit hotter. What's notable, really, is how slow this brew is. The Technivorm, I think, was 3 1/2 minutes. This was 5 1/2 minutes to deliver the same amount of water. So a much longer contact time. And as a result, an increased extraction. This was the second highest extractor overall. So it was pulling a bit more out of the coffee than most of the other brewers. Solid temperature, interesting approach to brewing. Pretty impressed, especially for the money. Now, the Sage or Breville brewer is different to some of the others. It's a pumped brewer, so it's not using the same sort of heating technology as other ones here that we've talked about. And it runs a pretty continuous flow after a bloom phase. And I brewed this in it's kind of gold cup sort of brew setup, which is the sort of default, I guess, if you use the machine. Temperature wise, pretty stable. In the mid to upper nineties the whole time. You can dial this machine in to do very precise temperature control. I can't, without finding a better way of doing temperature readings than I was, you know, just a probe inside the shower head, confirm how accurate the machine is if you make a one degree C temperature adjustment. I suspect you will see an average drop in temperature. Being the fastest brewer of the group, and it was pretty fast, I think just under 3 1/2 minutes, it had the lowest extraction that I measured of the group. Now that isn't the end of the world. I might just grind a bit finer for this brewer. I have used this a lot in the past. I've never really had problems with it and extraction when I've measured it. So I'm not hugely concerned by it being lower, but it's just interesting that a faster brew time, relatively low agitation, resulted in what might be expected, which is a lower extraction overall. So the Wilfa is a little bit like the Sage in that it's a pumped machine. Though it works a little differently from a temperature perspective than the other ones, too. What's notable if you look at the temperature chart for this machine, is that it starts a little bit hotter and then runs a little bit cooler the rest of the cycle. That might be considered desirable, you know. At the start, you want it to be as hot as possible to get everything up to temperature, and then don't keep it too hot. Have that temperature come back a little bit for the bulk of the brew. That's their approach, anyway. Now, to note in the extraction testing, there is a flow restrictor at the base of the cone here. I had it set to the 0.75 liter setting that you would in theory use. This is designed to kind of compensate so you can use one grind size in everything. I picked a 0.75 cause I was using that much water. The brew time overall, again, pretty quick at about 3 1/2 minutes. The extraction though, that little bit higher. It extracted very nicely. Made, you know, what I thought was good tasting coffee, but certainly a very solid extraction from the Wilfa. So this brewer, the Brazen, again has a different technology for heating water in it. It's a little bit more kind of brute force. Essentially, you put your water in the top of the machine, your desired amount. Put the lid on, close the lid, and then it heats the whole water tank up to your desired temperature. Then it opens the valve and lets it out over the coffee through a spray head. Pretty simple. Now this was set to 90 degrees C when I did the test, which was the sort of out of the box setting. And what's interesting in my temperature data is that it spiked above 90 C. I suspect this heat until it detects 90 degrees C in the water, but some residual heat in the heating element may cause it to rise above that and overshoot a little bit. So if you look at the temperature chart, you'll see that while it starts quite hot, it does decline towards the end, which is interesting and potentially quite desirable. It's a little bit slow as a brewer, around four minutes to brew 750 grams of water. And the extraction, solid. So last up is the Ratio. And this was interesting, this uses that kind of, again, that displacement technology. There's no pump in here, powering the water over the coffee. So it brews quite gently. Temperature wise, pretty impressive. It does a bloom phase at the start that you can see in the temperature data. And then once it's brewing, it a pretty consistent flow and a very consistent temperature. When it came to extraction, this actually came out higher than any of the other brewers, which is interesting. Not by much. Not, I think, in a significant way, but it is at the top end when it comes to extraction, which is notable. What's interesting about this is that the brew time overall was actually relatively slow. It was 4 1/2 minutes. So not the slowest of all the brewers, but still relatively slow. But seemingly there's enough agitation despite the slow flow that you do get that bump in extraction. So overall, a very good brewer on a technical level. I should note now actually this little piece here, there's a piece right at the top of the brew basket that's designed to maintain temperature. It looks like that really does work, judging by the temperature going on here, judging by the bed temperature that we measured. That's definitely a piece that works. But we'll talk more about that piece a little bit later on. This next one's kind of a weird one, but I think it's actually really important. When you fill the water in the tank to the line that says 750 mils, is it accurate? Because I felt in the past with some brewers, I've weighed my water, 'cause I'm a bit weird. And I poured it in and it hasn't matched up. I took each brewer, placed it empty. Not entirely empty, there's still water inside the system, but no water in the tank. Placed on the brewer. And I filled to the respective lines and I saw what weight of water it required to get there. And on four of the six brewers, those lines matched up perfectly. So on the Oxo, it was accurate. On the Technivorm, it was accurate. On the Wilfa, it was accurate. And on the Behmor, it was accurate. Two brewers, however, were quite shockingly out. And that was the Sage brewer and the Ratio. I noticed pretty quickly that these were out. And so I did multiple measurements to see what was going on. So I'll start with the Sage brewer. And I'll tell you what the line said and what weight of water we'd got. So at 450, we got 510 grams of water. At 600, it needed 690 grams of water to fill. To get to the 900 line, I needed 1020 grams of water to do that. And to get to the 1,200 line, I needed 1,320 grams. That is 10% out, and that is unacceptable. Similarly for the Ratio. That has cup lines, right? Two, four, six, eight. To get to the first two-cup line took 470 grams of water. So a cup, apparently there's 235 grams of water. But if we double that and go to four cups, well that took 815 grams. So a cup goes from 235 down to just under 204. The six cup line took 1,100 grams, which is about 183 grams per cup of water. A little bit more shrinkage again. And then to get to the 8 cup line was 1370 grams, which meant your average cup size was down to like 171. So your cup goes from being 171 grams to 235 grams of water, depending on which cup line you use. It does really bother me, and it doesn't set you up for success in the morning if you're trying to use the guidance that they give you to fill the brewer. Now let's talk about carafes. So, here's how the carafe test is gonna work. I'm gonna pour a cup of coffee. Then I'm gonna pour everything out of the carafe that I can and put it back on the scale, which has been set up for the weight of an empty carafe and zeroed out. So whatever it shows is how much has been trapped in the carafe that is unpourable. It just bothers me in carafe design. First up is the Technivorm. A bit messy. If I'm honest, I've never had a great time with the Technivorm's carafe design. It's always been a bit of a messy pour, a bit of coffee on the spout here. Let's see what it retains. One gram, very good. Low retention, but not great for pouring. I'd score it probably a 4 out of 10 on its quality of pour. The Oxo, oh, very good, very good pour. Oh, no, little drip down the front. Loses some points there. It's just messy and annoying. The little top of this carafe is actually a little bit difficult to hold. It doesn't really have any grip points. Anyway, let's just empty it out and see what we've got. 15 grams. Dinged For some points there. Poured very nicely, not perfectly but very nicely, but 15 grams of retained coffee is quite annoying. Pouring with the Sage carafe. Very good pour. Nice, controlled, no drips, very good. What's left? 14 grams of retained coffee. Again, just annoying. That's just like annoying as an amount. So the Wilfa's the only one that doesn't have a thermal carafe, it's a glass carafe, which makes people feel a certain way. How does it pour? Very well. How does it do for retention? A gram, a gram of coffee residue inside there, which I think is pretty acceptable. So that's the, I guess, the upside of a glass carafe. They're just easier to get all the liquid out of. The Behmor, a bit spattery. I've got a bit of liquid kind of spattering around the place. It's a bit messy. That's not a great pour experience. Retention is actually only two grams in this carafe, but it really needs a good shake, and you need to kind of backwards and forwards it a little bit, which is not ideal. So the Ratio's carafe has a lot going on. And I've had some issues with it. Here you've got a button that lifts a little stopper in the exit spout. And that seems nice in principle, but I've had issues with the stopper not seating properly when it goes up and down, and that's caused problems. This is actually the second attempt of filming this one section 'cause I had an issue with the carafe. Let's start again. Anyway, it doesn't pour very well. I feel, I'm not trying to play this out for dramatic effect. This carafe makes me feel quite stupid. Like, I feel like, I let the stopper go. It should seat back down, it should seal the unit. I should be able to tip it up. And yet, you know, having had this in white for a while and used it a fair bit, I've never managed to pour without some coffee running down the front of this. It's not usually this bad. This is, it feels unfair. And I'm not trying to, you know, make it seem like a worse problem than it is. But I have repeatedly had issues with the design of this carafe and the neatness of it's pouring. And I just want to flag it. And I haven't seen that talked about in many other reviews, but it has been an issue for me. And it might just be one bad lid. But it's definitely an issue so far. Six grams of retained liquid, which isn't that bad, but getting all the liquid out was not particularly easy. So now we'll do a quick blind tasting. I don't want to put too much stock in this. It's just mostly for interest. And I feel like you'd all be mad if I didn't taste the coffee from all of them side-by-side. So just have a quick taste, see where we're at. You get one slurp. So the most important thing right off the bat, if you own one of these brewers, then don't worry about upgrading, right? Because they all brew coffee slightly differently, but none of them is brewing coffee in a way that is a noticeable leap forward in quality, right? Like you're not getting a massive improvement by picking one of these brewers. And again, this is the same coffee, same grind setting, all of that kind of stuff. They're all set to the same temperature, if they have a temperature control, of 97 was where I was sort of going because the ones that don't have that temperature control are brewing around there. There are other aspects of these brewers. The usability that we need to talk about a lot more. But from a brewing perspective, it's pretty similar. There's differences, there's differences. This bowl feels probably the least extracted to me or amongst the lightest. This one here very textural, right? Like it's very full-bodied, very kind of rich and round, very sweet. I do, probably my favorite bowl, this one here. This is nice, like a little less texture but still sweet. And actually very similar to this bowl. And then I say these two feel a little bit lighter on the end there. But there's not much in it, right? Like this is really not... It's blind, but it's not like a truly useful insightful tasting, I don't think. But let's see what the results are. That is indeed the Sage. So I think I told you about it before, it for a given grind setting does extract a little bit less. That seems to hold true here. I'm interested if this then correlates to the Ratio. It does, it is the Ratio. Okay, really consistently a very good performer when it comes to coffee brewing. These two, I liked, which were the Behmor and the Wilfa. And then this would be the old Moccamaster and the Oxo over on the end here also performing very well. I've no real complaints about the way that these brewers brew, but it's an interesting opportunity to taste side by side. And I don't really know why the Sage extracts a little bit less for a given grind setting and the Ratio extracts a bit more, but that does seem to hold true across multiple tests and tastings and that kind of stuff. So let's start wrapping up these brewers. I'll give you some overview thoughts, dig out the last few little details on them and talk about those, too. The Moccamaster, the Technivorm Moccamaster. Really, there's not a lot to say about it, in a kind of good way. This thing has no extra features. It has an on button and that's kind of it, you know? Yeah, this is a stopper under here so if you pull the carafe out, it doesn't drip, but that's really it. And yeah, it is outshone from a features perspective by a number of the other brewers, who do all sorts of fancy things. They have more control, more options, more settings, more stuff. This doesn't. When it comes to brewing coffee, yes, technically other brewers are more temperature stable, you know, extracting a little bit more from the coffee, but I like the coffee this thing makes. I've liked it for a long time. It makes nice coffee. You can do stuff to do a better job with it. There's techniques, that kind of stuff. Maybe we'll talk about that one day, but buying this feels like an emotional decision rather than a highly logical decision. You buy this because you love how it looks, you love how it feels. They're 230 pounds, there's a little brand tax there, but it's an old company. They built a lot of these things and they have a great reputation still. And so while it is in the middle of the pack for pricing or features or all that kind of stuff, it is a solid, reliable performer. It's highly likable, it looks great. And I wouldn't have an issue recommending one if you liked the look and feel of it and it was something you wanted to own. So the Oxo, the nine cup brewer. I'm very glad I got to test this. I'd heard a lot of good things about what they're doing in coffee as a company. And this was definitely interesting, enjoyable, and a contender in this particular grouping. Now all product design involves compromise, right? You got to compromise somewhere, otherwise, everything you build would be expensive and beautiful and unaffordable by almost everybody. What's important is to compromise in the right places. And I feel like they've done a good job with that here, With this brewer, it feels metal where you want it to feel metal, but they're using plastic in other places. I think the design is nice. In terms of features, it does the barest of minimums. It's got a clock and therefore you can set it to brew at a certain time in the morning. That's a nice thing. And you've also got two settings, depending on how much coffee you're making. So like a two to five cups or five to nine cups. It will brew a little differently in terms of how it delivers water in those things. And that's really it. It's in $210, which I think is actually a very fair price. You get a lot of good quality brewing. It brews well, it's temperature stable, it extracts well. It's quite slow, but if you're having it come on for you at a certain time, you can account for that. The little dial is the cheapest part of it in terms of feel. Like if I was to nitpick, this isn't a beautiful dial. It feels a little loose. Compared to everything else, it just doesn't feel wonderful. And it kind of betrays a little bit of the compromise in terms of materials in the machine, but the coffee's good. And that's probably the most important thing. So I think if you are a little budget constrained and you're in North America, this is definitely worth considering. I think you get a lot of bang for your buck. You get everything you need and kind of nothing more. I don't mind that there's no temperature control on this. It's nice to have, but it's not essential. It makes nice coffee. So overall, I'm a little bit impressed with this. I think it's a good brewer. So the Sage or Breville Precision Brewer. I made a whole video about this before. It's linked in the description if you wanna check that out. So I'm not gonna rehash the whole thing, but it's a very Sage product, very Breville product. There's just a ton of features crammed into this thing. It's a conical and a flatbed brewer, but I'd recommend the conical. You can adjust brew temperatures. You can adjust bloom time, bloom volumes, flow rates, all of these kinds of things. You can have gold cup brewing presets or you can have your brew presets. It's got a timer, it'll come on first thing in the morning. The list goes on. It's a good brewer. I've had good results from it. It's interesting to me that compared to others, it extracts less from the same grounds, but I'd always just dialed in my grind setting to get what I needed to with the brewer when I've used it. So that's kind of interesting. One thing seems to be true is that the European version of this has more features than the U.S. one. That seems entirely weird to me. I don't really understand it. And I don't understand why they can't get the markings on a water tank right. That's just really weird to me, too. So it's not a perfect brewer, but it is a good, solid, reliable one packed full of features. And I think is very good value for money. The Wilfa, I think looks great. It's striking, it's beautiful, it feels minimalist. There's a lot about this design to like, if this kind of thing appeals to you. If it doesn't, then you'll just hate it, and that's okay. Points to Wilfa for being the only ones to do this. Why is that so hard? Why can't I have a detachable water tank? They can do it, why can't everyone else do it? 'Cause I love detaching the tank. Take it, fill it. If you've got good tap water, life is easy. Often these things are under kitchen cabinets. I don't want to, you know, maneuver a jug under there. That's just, it's just awkward. This is nice. That the tank is accurate is nice. That it tells you how much coffee it recommends, and that I agree, is nice. So that, big win. The hot plate/glass carafe thing is much more contentious. Now in reviews of, let's say the Sage in the past, a lot of people have complained that brewing into a thermal carafe actually takes too much heat out of the coffee. And they hate that the first cup they get is not hot enough. I've never had that problem, but people do. And that's kind of confusing to me, but it is a thing that people repeatedly say. This does fix that problem. But know that heating your coffee for a prolonged period of time will make it taste worse. So I don't recommend that for a kind of long-term storage, but at least those first few cups will be piping, piping hot. One small complaint about the brewer is that this cone here hangs on the central thing. And actually getting on and off, it's not beautiful. Like it's a touch awkward. I know I did that quite easily then, but you can find yourself kind of searching for the little hook to get it in. And that's not my favorite part of this brewer. There's no settings or adjustments here outside of the little collar here, which is a float restrictor underneath the cone. There's just an on-off button. And again, if you'd like that, you like that. If you want more, you'll be frustrated. For the money, I might've hoped for a little bit more. Maybe that's temperature control. Maybe that's an auto-start or kind of timer function in there, but something for the money I feel would be justified. Because it is expensive. It is expensive for a brewer, but it is a kind of design piece that brews great coffee. So the Brazen is a very different feeling brewer to all of the others. It is unconventional in comparison. It is big, it feels big unwieldy. And if I'm honest, for me personally, it's not my favorite design of the brewers here. I find the kind of shaping, styling, the lines on it. They're just not for me. I would have gone with a kind of cleaner thing with less lines, less shapes, less textures, less stuff going on. It does feel top heavy and it feels kind of weird to have a kettle on legs, above your coffee. And you boil that up. It just feels weird to me to have it this way around. But it is a kind of brute force solution and elegant in its own way of having temperature control relatively easily. It's got the extra features you might want. You can control things like bloom time and those kinds of stuff, and kind of pre brewing. You have an altitude compensation to help you make sure you can actually boil the water or get the water to the temperature you need wherever you are in the world. It's got a clock and auto-start and those kinds of things. The mesh metal basket is a nice one as they go. I'd probably want to put paper in there long-term but that's just me and my preferences. And it's 150 pounds, which is the cheapest of all of them. But it does feel it. The buttons don't feel particularly premium. The materials don't feel particularly premium. But that's the decision, that's the compromise here. I think for many people, it would be the aesthetics that are the hurdle to clear. Like, do you like this enough in terms of how it looks, how it fits into your kitchen? But I do like the coffee that it makes. I think it does a good job. Plenty of features for your money. So overall, I don't really have any big issues with this brewer at all. So the Ratio. I, as you might expect, have pretty mixed feelings about this in a pretty strong way. It looks great, right? Like, it feels premium. It's expensive, but it's all metal. The shape is lovely, the design is nice. You don't have to have it in kind of matte white. There's a matte black. There's kind of a shiny silver one, too. I think it is a very good looking brewer. Very feature light, right? You have a button, you have a go button and that's kind of it. It'll bloom for you. Whether you're brewing 20 grams or whether you're brewing 80 grams, it's gonna bloom the same way regardless. And that to me feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. Though I don't know how you, I don't have a solution for the UI of setting those things. Anyway, the experience of using it is kind of frustrating to me. It's just got a lot of bits, and not all of them are in at any one time, right? Like, so to brew, you have this stack of three things. And getting in and out is awkward, right? Like you go your open carafe, your brew basket. And then your sort of heat shield at the top here. And this really keeps the heat in. That seems to be potentially the secret sauce of this brewer, but maybe not. It definitely brews well, but manipulating in is awkward. That doesn't feel good. And then straight after brewing, when I pull it out, the rubber flicks back at me and often flicks a little bit of what is ultimately cold water at me, but I just don't like that part of the experience. And then having taken this off, you then need to sort of rebuild it. So this comes off and goes on the little base thing here. And then I gotta put my lid on here. And then, you know, you've got this carafe that I think is not great as a carafe. I think this lid is a real problem. In addition to what I've said, the lid, when you wash it, can get water stuck inside and that's just gross. Like two days later, you move the lid around and water of an unknown age comes out. No, that's not okay. So there's so much right here. This makes really great coffee. It looks really good. But for me, it falls down in a couple of areas that as someone who reviews things kind of wind me up maybe more than it does other people. Like I said, I've watched lots of reviews of this brewer and people aren't mad about the same things that I'm mad about. Which means either I'm having an unusually bad time or other people just don't think about this stuff the same way. And it's hard to know which is which ultimately, right? So I like this brewer, but I also have some substantial issues with this brewer. In the UK, I think it's a bit more expensive comparatively than it is in the U.S., which maybe hurts a bit more to have it at 375 pounds. But, you know, like I said, I don't feel like it's been compromised in terms of its materials or construction or performance or all those things. Honestly, I feel like the tweaks and fixes to this are relatively simple. I don't think I'm ever gonna love the stack of three things to slide in, but I think you could definitely fix the lid of this carafe and have a better experience. And that would be, for me, an actual massive improvement in the overall experience. I do feel a bit like I've picked on this brewer more than the others, but it's just doubly frustrating when it performs so well and then falls down in these little places that are, for me, kind of issues. With all of that out of the way, let's move to recommendations. I feel like when you're shopping for one of these things, you're kind of looking at either the best quality coffee from something, the best looking, the best kind of design experience, or the kind of best bang for buck. And I would say on the last one, the best value for money, for me, probably is the Oxo, actually. I think at $210, it does lots. It makes nice coffee, big capacity. I think that's great value. And I can't imagine spending $210 in a better way to get a cup of coffee in the morning from an automated brewer. If your goal is quality of extraction and nothing else, then I would say the Ratio, certainly the Wilfa, the Behmor actually, probably all of them are all in contention. As the kind of the most feature rich, I think the Sage, if you want everything in there and the kitchen sink, The Sage/Breville brewer is it. And if it is really just about design, well, that's in the eye of the beholder, right? It's between the Ratio, the Wilfa and the Moccamaster, I think are the three strongest pieces of visual design of product design from just an aesthetic perspective. But of course I don't get to keep these. All of these brewers are gonna be given away to my Patreon supporters.", "videoID": "t8eYs2vxT-8"}, {"title": "An Experimental Coffee Ice Cream (That's Delicious)", "text": "Today we're gonna make a coffee ice cream unlike any coffee ice cream you've had before. Probably, I mean, I don't know your life but here's the idea behind what we're doing. Most coffee ice creams are kind of dairy-based. They're kind of cappuccino ice creams and they're delicious. They're delicious. But, what if you made something that was a coffee coffee ice cream, and not like a dairy coffee ice cream. Traditionally, that doesn't really work very well. You might have had like an espresso granita at some point in your life that was punishing on just about every level. If you like that, that's not a judgment. They're just very bitter, they're kind of grainy. The reason I thought this was a good idea to try is that my friend Chris made a video about this thing. It's called the Ninja CREAMi, which is a terrible name, and it's a sort of ice cream machine, sort of. I got weird about ice cream at one point in my life and restaurants have a thing called a Pacojet. Now a Pacojet is basically a drill press with a spinning blade attached, that you sort of push through a frozen tub of ice cream base. So you freeze it solid as a block and then the Pacojet basically slices it down to be ice cream again, which is weird, but really cool. But they're like six grand. This is a domestic version of a Pacojet basically, and it's \u00a3180, which is still expensive but a lot cheaper than \u00a36,000. And actually cheaper than some fancy, fancy ice cream machines, and it works the same way. Right you put a solid block of frozen ice cream base in it. It's got a little blade in here like this that just gets pressed through that solid block. It's amazing, it's very cool. This is not a sponsored video. I bought this, this is not like an endorsement thing. Ninja have no idea I'm making this video. I just thought it was cool, and it let me do some experiments. Now the first experiment was, what if you just take some really nice brewed coffee, sweeten it, freeze it, and then turn that into ice cream. Which is what I did. Let me get that now. This is most definitely not ice cream or sorbet at this point it's just a a solid block. For this I brewed a little Kenyan coffee, shout out Tim Wendelboe, very delicious. All right, it's in, it's loaded. Lock it in like that. And then it's gonna take it like a minute to just basically press that blade through the whole tub. Let's do sorbet. Let's have a look. So that looks, that looks like ice cream, that is brewed coffee and sugar, and that's it. It's very exciting, from a texture perspective. Now I'll say, or at this point, for this recipe that I'll show you in a minute, you don't need one of these, you can use any ice cream machine that you might have. This was just interesting from a texture point of view. And plus I've wanted a Pacojet for like a decade. All right, let's have a little taste. So creamy, weird. Here's the problem, firstly, and this is kind of weird. It tastes of coffee, but this was a vibrant, interesting, well-brewed Kenyan coffee, like tons of character. It gets really, really muted by the whole thing. It has a kind of generic coffeeness that comes through, but all of the character just doesn't, it's too cold. Which kind of bummed me out. Secondly, even though this is a light roast, and it's brewed well, it has this bitterness in the finish. And so, one of the reasons I went with filter coffee, like a V60, is that it's kind of a lower bitterness than say espresso that you might dilute down, but it still has this kind of harshness in the finish that kind of takes away the joy that you wanna experience with good coffee. So, to counteract all of this, I decided to set out to create a kind of different sort of coffee ice cream recipe. What I'll do now is show you what I did, what each ingredient is kind of doing, and how you might wanna adapt it around the coffee that you want to turn into delicious ice cream. Credit where credit is due: this recipe was adapted from one from ChefSteps for a roasted cocoa gelato, that was kind of interesting dairy-free ice cream. That was a kind of inspiring sort of starting point for me, and then I've adapted it from there. So first up we're gonna make some dry ingredients 120 grams of sugar. I tried using a brown sugar, it kind of competes with the flavor of coffee. So just stick with plain white sugar if you can. Second up, five and a half grams of salt. That's gonna do quite a lot of the work to counteract the bitterness at the back end of the coffee. It's not gonna taste salty, it's just gonna be delicious. Then we're gonna add a couple of gums. These are the ones in the ChefSteps recipe that sort of really helped. First up is a gram of lambda carrageenan, and then another gram of locust bean gum. Now gums are really interesting, they do some useful things. They help sort of produce a creamier texture, and they also slow the melt of the ice cream, which is on a hot day, a good thing. You're gonna whisk these together so they're combined just so that they're easily distributed into the water. Now you're gonna put this into about 100 mls of water because we need to heat this up to a boiling point, to dissolve the sugar and hydrate the gums and get them doing the gummy thing that they need to do. So we're gonna mix, combine, bring to the boil, and just gently simmer for three minutes, and then we're done. We're gonna brew about half a liter of filter coffee here. You don't need all of it, but you only have a little tiny shot of filter coffee left over as kind of excess. That's a treat for you. I'm gonna use this kind of nice Kenyan coffee again. You don't need to the Kenyan coffee for this, you could use anything I think that has a little bit of kind of red fruit to it. I think really nice Colombian coffees can do that, great Guatemalan coffees can do that. Lots of east African coffees can do interesting fruitiness. That's the kind of ballpark flavor I would recommend for this particular recipe, but we'll talk about adaptation to different coffees in a little bit. Recipe wise we're gonna brew it 70 grams a liter, that little bit stronger. I want enough coffee flavor in the ice cream that I'm enjoying the coffeeness of it, but not so much that I'm getting kind of caffeinated at a time where maybe I don't want a lot of caffeine and I'm not eating my caffeine allowance for the day. So I figure this is a nice ratio. You can extract it properly, it'll taste really good. And paper filters will help reduce bitterness, kind of particles in there, so definitely recommend that as a kind of brew method. Can be any paper filter though, but paper filter for sure. If you're new to the channel and you wanna know more about how I'm brewing this particular coffee there's a guide to the V60, which I'll leave a link to down below. So as I said, 400 grams of liquid. And a little extra for you. Now here, we're brewing somewhere around 1.4, 1.5% strength. If you really wanna know about that stuff. You could brew stronger, right? You could use cold brew if you really wanted to in this particular recipe, the choice is up to you. But I'm looking for as much complexity as I can get, even though I'm gonna lose quite a lot later, but you know you wanna make sure you're extracting the coffee properly and having a balanced brew at the end of it. So for me, 70 grams, but you could go a little higher if you really wanted to. Cheers. Mm, juicy. So now we need a blender. Now, you don't have to have a giant monstrosity of a blender here. You could use a stick blender, you could probably hand whisk this if you really wanted to, but a blender will help make this whole bit a little bit easier. So, first in is our gelled syrup. That's gonna have a slightly weird texture, don't freak out, it's okay. It's good news, I promise. And then throw in not all of the coffee right now, but a good splash. Now we're gonna add three things for taste reasons, as well as a little bit of texture, 'cause ice cream ingredients have a kind of either taste or texture or sometimes both role. First up I'm gonna add some fat to the whole deal. Again, inspired by that ChefSteps recipe, I'm gonna use a little bit of cocoa butter, just 30 grams and that's gonna increase the richness of it without competing for the flavor too much. It's relatively neutral, and I think a complimentary flavor. Second ingredient is perhaps a little bit controversial. I wanna use a tiny little bit of cocoa powder. Now in loads of chocolate cake recipes, they always say use like a little bit of espresso powder or a little bit of coffee in there to amplify the chocolatiness. And I wondered, could you go the other way? Could a little tiny bit of cocoa powder, amplify the kind of chocolatiness of coffee, when it does chocolate, if you know what I mean. And it turns out it does. We're gonna use two grams maximum, like a tiny amount here. I'm using a very nice one. If you used a sort of more aggressive, more commercial powder, I might reduce that a little bit more, but here two grams. I wanted to bring back a little bit of fruitiness. And I was trying to think of a kind of way to do that, and I landed on maraschino cherries. I would avoid something in kind of a liqueur, we're going to stay sort of alcohol free. This is just a sort of sugar syrup. I had some of these cherries lying around, this syrup is delicious, but we're only gonna use 10 grams. And in the final product, it'll be there in a very subtle way, where you might not even notice it if you didn't know it was there, it just reminds you of that kind of fruitiness of coffee, the sweet good fruitiness that great coffees have. Quick blend. And then we'll throw the rest to the coffee in. Now what we're gonna do, regardless of whether you're gonna churn it in a sort of cheap domestic ice cream machine, or a fancy domestic ice cream machine, or whether you're gonna do what I'm gonna do, which is freeze it as a solid block and deal with that later. You wanna cool this down as much as possible. Don't put hot things in your freezer, not a good idea. So we're gonna make a simple ice bath for this, and just chill it down, getting it ready to go into the freezer. So this is now fully chilled down to like cold, cold, cold. You could churn it in a normal machine, and you'll get a great result, not quite the texture that I'm gonna get today, but a delicious result. Me, I'm just gonna freeze this in this little tub to a solid block. Lid on. So we're gonna put this in the freezer for 24 hours or if you're like me and you want a little movie magic we have a frozen one right here. Lovely. Frozen nice and solid, ready to be made into delicious ice cream. (machine whirs &amp; roars)  Let's have a little taste. Oh, look at that texture. Do you know, I don't really know how to describe what this is, because this isn't a purest expression of coffee, because it just doesn't work as a straight kind of coffee coffee ice cream. But it has a lot of what I like about coffee, and a few of those things kind of amplified a little bit. The texture is fantastic. That little bit of extra kind of richness from the cocoa butter is there. You can taste it a little bit, but it's just subtle enough. If you're looking for it, you'll find it, and that's true of the cocoa powder, again, subtle. If you look for it, you'll find it but otherwise it's just adding to this kind of overall kind of blend of flavors that is very enjoyable. It's still very coffee, but it's also something more. It's just delicious. Now the whole point of this recipe in some ways was to kind of create a platform in which you could play with. Firstly, don't obsess over carrageenan and lambda carrageenan in particular, locust bean gum is doing most of the work here, and you could use other thickeners if you wanted to. There's plenty of research on using thickeners in ice cream online. So sub out as you will, for what you can find easily. Secondly, with the cherry flavor in this, it's very subtle, but very nice, but it compliments the coffee. But if you wanted to brew say a really wild fermentation, or a very kind of naturally natural processed coffee, you could use pineapple syrup if you wanted to, or anything else just to add that little bit of complexity back that's missing from the very cold temperatures. Now as I said, you could churn this in any ice cream machine that you have. You may not get the flawless texture that this has, but it will still be a delicious treat. And if you are absolutely desperate for dairy, make a reverse affogato.", "videoID": "CHPn77jpt2w"}, {"title": "The Best Portable Espresso Machine - A Ridiculous London Day Out", "text": "Today, we're gonna answer the question of whether drinking an espresso in an interesting, unusual, or beautiful place makes it taste better. Well, not really. We're actually gonna be comparing four portable espresso makers, but that's kind of the same question, because there's been a kind of boom in portable espresso makers. And you have to ask why? Now, I get wanting coffee somewhere that isn't your home, isn't a cafe, isn't work, I understand that, but espresso is difficult. It's technically challenging. It's a difficult problem to solve to make that anywhere. And I know the idea is out there that somehow espresso is the pinnacle of coffee brewing. It's not, but it is delicious. And so I guess it's worth doing this comparison. And so today, we have four brewers. We've got the Picopresso, the Handpresso, the Nomad, and the Flair PRO 2. And we'll take them to four different places, and we'll make coffee with them. And we'll see which one is the best, the most portable, the most delightful. Now, this espresso is made with the Picopresso. And to tell you what it's like to use and what it tastes like, we have to go up the river and back in time, and I can walk you through what it's like to make espresso on a boat. So the Picopresso comes in this very nice, very tasteful, little travelling case. And inside, it is a box of tricks. Let me show you. So this is the brewer and everything sort of lives inside. Let me open it up. You get a dosing funnel, we'll need that later. You get a tamper, we'll need that later. You get possibly the single most useless brush I've ever seen, but you know, came with it. And then, you get your needle distribution tool. The rest of it is in here, so you've got your basket. You've got like a little base piece. And then, here, you can take this bit off and have like a naked basket underneath. It's very compact. It's everything you need except hot water and ground coffee. Now, with all these brewers today, hot water is going to be a little bit of a challenge. We're not, you know, we don't have a kettle here on the boat. Why would we? So instead, we're gonna be using a Thermos which is preheated and full of boiling water. So actually, about 96 Celsius. And that's what we'll use throughout the day as a kind of a pretty good solution, to be honest. I think for this shot, we'll run naked. So you can see the sort of most beautiful version of this thing. Now, coffee, freshly ground of course. And I gotta say, the little dosing ring is a nice touch. Coffee in, we'll dose about 15 grams today, which is like a decent dose, honestly. Now, what you're supposed to do is get the little needle tool and do some needling. And then, we tamp. So the way this thing works is you have this little pumping action here on the side, right? Now, you pump it to build pressure. And it works, which honestly, I was quite skeptical about at the start, but it really works. So to make coffee, all we need now is hot water in our reservoir and we can go. We can make espresso anywhere, here, anywhere. This is, oh, danger brew. Now, the sensible person would put the cup down on the side next to me and I'd kind of brew it above that. No. Today, we've gotta do it right. So I'm gonna brew and you start with 8 to 10 little pumps just to get things going, a little pre-infusion. And then, we're gonna leave it just a little bit. And then, having let it pre-infuse, pump til we build a good amount of pressure. Oh yes, now, there we go. Oh, I'm making a mess, but we're brewing espresso, so... And now, rather chaotically, I've made espresso that I'm gonna drink here. You know, St Paul's in the background. This is pretty good. All right, cheers. That was pretty good. Honestly, it shouldn't be, but it was pretty good. It was maybe seasoned a little bit by being here. And that's kind of part of this whole thing. But it's actually, genuinely, a very capable brewer. Now, it's not flawless. It has a number of issues that kind of bother me. But it makes way better espresso than it has any kind of a right to do. I think it needs some preheating if you're gonna use it regularly. That first shot through can be a little bit cool so - and they do recommend pre-heating. But it's that constant battle with anything that doesn't have a power supply to get the brew temp you need. The basket inside it is disappointing in its construction and quality. The holes aren't that good, and so you can replace it with something from IMS. It's \u00a3130 and to get it to be that price, that seems expensive, but for an espresso maker, that's not that expensive, but the construction feels occasionally a little bit cheap. I would worry about longevity, about robustness. I know it has a little carry case. And if you were regularly throwing this in a bag and taking it up a mountain or whatever else, there'd be a fear of dropping it, breaking it, snapping a plastic bit, that kind of stuff there. There's a kind of weird, intuitive feeling to pulling shots with it, though I you wish you had some kind of gauge or feedback on how much pressure you've built in it. But for what it is, it is surprisingly good. Enough of being on the river. It's time, I think, to be over the river. So for this journey, we're gonna be using the Handpresso. Now, this originally came out back in 2008, and it's much cheaper, it's only \u00a360. Which is still a decent amount of money, but it's cheap for an espresso machine. The solution is kind of interesting. You basically take a bicycle pump and put a coffee bit on it. Instead of just pumping the whole time though, what you do is you build pressure. So you open your little handle bit here, there's a little gauge, and you wanna pump until you get to, well, it says 16 bars. So I presume 15 is where we're aiming. And right next to the sort of green bit is a red bit that feels stressful to me, honestly, to have the kind of good and the bad so close to each other. Now, we're gonna pump away and get up to pressure. We've got our 16, 15/16 bars of pressure. Let's get it loaded with some grounds. Now, to do that, take off this piece. And underneath is a little basket. Now, this, we fill with coffee. And it only takes about five, five and a half grams, which is a problem. Not just because it's too small of a dose to be useful, but also because it's miserable to get the coffee into this thing. It doesn't come with a tamper, but I have seen people tamp with the base of the handle. That kind of feels, honestly, a little bit gross, but I guess it works. And then, in here, we're gonna fill it with our kind of hot water, our freshly boiled water ideally, but here, it's 95, 96, we're okay. And fill it above the kind of fill level that you can see inside this thing. Coffee in. Twist into place. Need a cup to turn it upside down. And when we push go, it'll kind of release this sort of coffee sneeze and make an espresso. As for portions, well, you're putting five grams in, you're typically getting between 10 and 15 out. And it's actually quite unreliable. The way it works is that you tamp this little basket, but then, the water's gonna come from the bottom of the basket. And so in brewing, we've often found that it just kind of blows the puck apart and makes a really channeled, uneven espresso. How does it taste? It's not, it's not good, it's not good. That whole ground coffee basket just feels like it isn't built for, kind of, purpose. It feels like the whole machine was really designed to be used with pods, which it has an adapter for, which I'll show you now. So it comes with a little plastic piece like this that you drop in and it lets you use what are called ESE pods. Now, if you're not familiar with them, they were invented by a company called Illy in the 1970s. And the ESE stands rather depressingly for Easy Serve Espresso pods. And they're like a little teabag of compressed ground coffee that you would use, right? There's loads of kind of domestic machines that use them. This can be adapted to do that. So that's what we'll do now. I've gotta say,  the whole pumping in public thing makes you feel super self-conscious. - What is he doing? - In with the pod, lock it off. Will this be a better espresso?  No, honestly, it looks pretty tragic. No crema, doesn't look good at all. Really small serve. Just, I don't understand who'd be happy with this little espresso for all of that work. It's a darker roast, so it's less aggressive, but it's still, it's not good. I don't really understand it. Honestly, this brewer is a kind of fun little invention, but it's from 2008 and it feels like technology has moved past it and it hasn't evolved. It's just, it's just not that good. I don't really think that the results that you get from the effort that you put in are really kind of worth it. So, fun, silly, relatively inexpensive, but maybe not something I would choose to brew with given a choice, even in a cable car. You know, that journey reminded me that when you live in a city, you don't really enjoy it the way a tourist does. I think it's time we change that. I've got a bus! So our third contender today is this strange, angular, blue box that is probably quite confusing. It's $250, it's called the Nomad from UniTerra. And you might wonder, \"Where does coffee go in or come out from? \"Why is there a tiny seesaw on the side?\" All good questions. Now, this thing is actually quite fun. I'll walk you through how it works. You've got a little locking mechanism on the top here. And if you unlock it, a little tray slides out. Now, this tray is your portafilter. It holds the filter. This is your little filter basket in here. This is sitting, actually, in this kind of white piece. Here at the bottom, you've got what they call their True Crema Valve, right? It's a little pressure restriction valve that lets you use coarsely ground or kind of inappropriately ground coffee and still get some crema, still get kind of okay results. And this whole thing sits in this little tray that helps funnel the liquid from the basket across, down into your cup. Here at the back, you've got the lid for your water tank. This actually holds 300 mls of liquid, which is surprising and kind of interesting. We'll come back to it. You've got a pressure gauge on the top. And that'll give you a kind of green zone for crema of six to 10 bars, and a red zone after that. And then, you've got your little seesaw piece here, right? And it's how you build pressure. It's how you pump water with this thing. Confused still? Don't worry. Let's make some coffee. Now, we're dosing the upper end today, another 15 gram dose. Now, it does come with a tamper, which is nice. It's sort of pretty, it's a nice shape. It doesn't perfectly fit though, which kind of bothers me. As you tamp with it, there's like a little bit of play, side-to-side. I wish it was just like a perfect fit. For a custom tamper, that's kind of weird. And then, in we go. I've gotta put this down to be safe as we make espresso in the middle of Piccadilly Circus, 'cause that's where everyone makes espresso now. So as before, 8, 10, 12 pumps, just to kind of get things going a little bit, build a little pressure. And then, when we're ready to go, ah, now we pump. Build up to like, I don't know, six, seven bars, and we get coffee. And we're done. If you wanna stop early, just lift the catch, and it discharges any pressure left over. And so now, we've made espresso, on Shaftesbury Avenue of all places. And that's very exciting. So cheers to another one of the most memorable espressos of my life. It's good, it's really good. It can really make some tasty espresso. And that was tasty espresso. But like I said, I'm not gonna be without my nitpicks because that's kind of inevitable. Firstly, the gap from the little spout to what would be the floor if you're putting it on something is a little bit small. I'm nerdy, I want a scale with my espresso cup on top so I know what I'm doing. No real option of that here, unless you have very teeny-tiny espresso cups. So that's kind of annoying. The design itself is kind of weird to look at. I don't know if that offends you or it delights you. I feel it could go kind of either way with this sort of a look. The little portafilter is a little bit irritating. So you've got some liquid to clean, kind of here. You need to clean the basket. You need to clean under the basket. And then, you still need to clean the little kind of gray tray thing as well. And that feels like work for a sink. You know, on the back of a bus, or really outside of a place with a sink, it's a bit fussy and annoying to clean. It kind of bothers me that way. It's not the worst, but it is notable if you're gonna take this somewhere, that cleanup is a little bit more work. And my last complaint is really about the water tank. 300 mls sounds good, that's lots of water, but you're not gonna use the same water across multiple espressos 'cause it's cooling down really rapidly inside the brewer. So you're gonna wanna put in as much as you need and not really anymore, but the problem is, the more water you put in, the more thermal stability you're gonna have. If you just put in 60 grams of water, that'll drop in temperature much, much quicker, so... It gives you more flexibility. If you wanna pull like a lungo, if you wanna do that kind of half espresso, half pour-over thing that the kids call a sprover, you can totally do that with this. And actually, it's really good for that. But that flexibility comes at a cost. If you like lighter roasts or you wanna pull at higher brew temperatures, it is that little bit more annoying. And so the Nomad is interesting. It's really a capable brewer. It can make delicious coffee, but it's awkward. And you have to wonder, does that work for you? It kind of doesn't belong in a kitchen, it's made to be taken everywhere, but it needs a flat surface, and benefits from a sink, and access to hot water. So I really like it. I find it charming. I find it fun. I find it flexible, but it's got its quirks. And I think those are worth considering if you were gonna pick one of these up. As for the little seesaw thing, whole-hearted endorsement. That is kind of fun, it's easy to use. I just enjoyed that as a mechanism more than almost anything else today. So that bit alone, a hearty endorsement. Overall, I am impressed. Now, these portable espresso makers don't just belong in these dense urban environments. We can take them somewhere a little greener too. Ah, yeah, I'm on a roof. Look, I know we could have gone to a park, but you wouldn't have the sound of sirens and construction in the background. And that just doesn't seem right. Anyway, we're here on a roof with the Flair. And you might argue this isn't really a portable espresso machine, but I think it is. It has a carry case, that says portable to me. And in fact, we've taken it to a park before. When we needed to pull shots of coffee from the 1950s, we took this with us to set up in the middle of a park in London. So I would say it is portable. Now, if you're not familiar with the Flair, I'll give you a quick walkthrough. We've reviewed different Flairs on the channel. This is the PRO 2. They all kind of work in a similar way. You've got your base, your frame, your lever. And then, here, you've got your brew chamber, which comes to pieces. You've got your little gauge there. In the bottom, your brew basket and your kind of puck screen that will sit on top of the coffee. In here is your kind of brewing chamber with a little piston piece that makes  funny noises. And that's kind of it, all right. To make a coffee with it is very simple, but I do feel like we're being perhaps a little too kind to the Flair. We're in a nice environment. We've got a table, I've got a chair. We could have maybe used this on the boat, but not on the bus, not in the cable car. So its portability is under question. We should make some coffee. I should drink one more espresso with a beautiful view. And we should talk about that. Gotta say, having a table really feels like cheating, it really does. It's a little messy, but that's outdoors, that's okay. Is it worth it if you're getting good espresso? Probably is. While it maybe doesn't have the kind of tank size flexibility of the Nomad, you have a much more kind of integrated experience. Like you, the gauge here, the feeling of pressure on the lever means you can do what you wanna do in terms of pressure as you're making espresso. But is it portable? Is it? I don't know. I feel like you can take it anywhere as long as you've got a Jetboil or something like that, some way of heating water, a coffee grinder obviously, or you can take pre-ground, but don't do that, but, but I don't know if I'd really count it as a super successful portable espresso machine. I would say it's a very capable, fully manual espresso machine, but in this lineup, you know, it just feels like it is at more of a disadvantage than the other brewers there. I mean, if you were out in the wilds, you didn't have a table, what are you gonna do? You're gonna put this on the floor? You're gonna pull a shot on floor? It justifies its price in lots of different ways. It's well-built, all of the parts feel more robust than most of the other brewers. It's kind of metal everywhere that counts. And I think that's a good thing. But as I kind of think about wrapping this up and comparing all four and saying which is the best portable espresso maker, it's got some challenges from its lack of portability. So as we luxuriate here on this roof, I think I should probably wrap up and tell you which I think is the best portable espresso maker, 'cause it's not a simple question to answer. Because I would say probably the best espresso maker is maybe the Flair, but it's not the best portable espresso maker. And I would say the best sort of most portable thing is clearly the Wacaco Picopresso, but it needs a few things, it needs a few tweaks, it needs a new basket to be better. But out of the box, it's not the best espresso maker. The Handpresso is just out, I didn't have a good time at all. And the Nomad sort of lives in between. It doesn't really feel like it truly has a place, and maybe that's its advantage. That's probably a good name for it to be the Nomad. But I think I would probably, if I was hiking up mountains every day or every weekend, be pretty tempted by this thing, it's pretty cool. This is just a lot of fun. And maybe if I brewed all over the place and I traveled around that I was sometimes in a hotel room, sometimes in a park, sometimes at home, this is kind of interesting. This really stays at home and maybe you take it with you somewhere else you might hang out for a while, if you're going on holiday or something like that and you're obsessed with espresso. And I will say coming into this, I was kind of questioning why it had to be espresso. Like why can't you just have nice coffee, filter coffee, 'cause that's easier to do kind of anywhere, but there's something so delightful about the improbability of drinking espresso in strange places that has truly delighted me. I've had some of the most memorable cups of coffee of my life today. And I would say if you own one of these things, take it somewhere stupid, do it. It's worth it. It's worth the weird looks you get from people. Go and make espresso somewhere weird 'cause it's great.", "videoID": "JT5Rz3QV74g"}, {"title": "Making Cappuccino\u29f8Latte\u29f8Flat White at Home (without an Espresso Machine)", "text": "You know when you want something, but you can't have it and it just makes you crave it all the more. And let's say for whatever reason, you couldn't go to your local cafe right now, and you didn't have an espresso machine at home. Well, you might really want a little flat white or a cappuccino or a latte. I'm here to help you. Today we're gonna talk about how you can get some really, really, really delicious drinks without having to have an espresso machine. I'm gonna explore how we can take coffee equipment we might already have and a few other bits and pieces and get to something surprisingly good. Now, that isn't to say espresso machines aren't necessary or useful. The magic of espresso is that it can extract all of the good tasting soluble stuff from the ground coffee using very little liquid. You can end up with a very, very strong cup of coffee that tastes fantastic, has great texture, got some lovely crema on top. That's the magic of espresso. No other brew method can do a good job of getting the flavor out of the grounds with as little liquid. Let's just say we've got a good burr grinder, but one that can't do espresso, one that doesn't go fine enough to pull traditional espresso shots, like this little cheap Wilfa grinder here. But we can still use a grinder like this to get something great. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna try and make coffee that's very strong, but about half as strong as espresso. In order to get all of the good flavors out of the ground coffee that we're going to start with, we're just gonna use a little bit more water. And that means we can use a pretty fine grind, but not as fine, but we need to have some sort of percolation. We need a little bit of pressure in there to get the water through the grinds. For that reason, we're gonna be looking at the AeroPress and the moka pot. These are things that lots of people have that can brew surprisingly strong coffee that tastes pretty great. Once we've looked at how to get the best out of those, then we're gonna talk about foaming milk at home. Today we're not gonna get overly hung up on the definitions of what is a cappuccino, what is a flat white, what is a cafe latte? I just want you to make something that you like and that requires you have a cup that you like of an appropriate size. Today we're gonna be trying to mimic an espresso in a way. So we're gonna start every time with 18 grams of ground coffee. Now, in espresso that would produce maybe 36 to 40 grams of liquid. Here we're gonna be looking more at 65 to 70 grams of liquid, using a little bit more water as a solvent to pull out some more flavor. That means we need some space in the cup for milk on top of that. So something in the six, seven ounces, 180, 200 mils, that sort of size is a pretty good place to start if you like the taste of coffee, but you can go a bit bigger if you'd like something a little softer, a little sweeter, a little less intense. Let's talk about how we're gonna brew some coffee. First of all, let's talk grind size. For our 18 grams of coffee that we're gonna use each time we're gonna be grinding pretty fine. What would be towards the limits of a typical cheap burr grinder. We should have a little bit of texture to it. It shouldn't feel floury in any way. It should feel a little bit between, say castor sugar and salt. It'll have a bit of texture. But on a grinder like the Wilfa, you are down at pretty much the finest setting here. If you're using a grinder that can go to espresso, you're gonna wanna be a little bit coarser for these techniques than you would be if you were pulling shots. Though that ground setting will be finer than most supermarket pre-ground coffee. So these techniques won't work super well if you're buying pre-ground coffee, you need a grinder to make life delicious. A quick PSA on the kinds of coffee that you could be using for this. Generally speaking, if you're roaster separates coffees that they've roasted specifically for espresso and specifically for filter or drip coffee, you definitely want something espresso focused. They're typically roasted a little bit longer, deeper, more developed to make them easier to extract with less water. If we brewed with a filter coffee, chances are we'd never do a good job extracting it and we'd have a very sour, unpleasant experience even when we've added our delicious, sweet milk down the line. Let's start with the AeroPress. Now, I know the AeroPress claims it can make espresso. It can't, it just can't, okay? Espresso is quite a specific thing. This cannot make it. You cannot produce the pressures necessary. You can't produce the concentrations necessary. Now, this is one of the few times where I'd advocate actually for brewing in what's called the inverted method. The conventional way to brew is just to place this on the cup, add your coffee, add your water, do your extraction this way around. What some people like to do though is called the invert method where you take the plunger, this becomes your base, and in here you have a chamber where if you add water and coffee, they can't go anywhere, they can't escape. That's what we're gonna do this time. Do make sure it's plunged in a decent amount of the way. The inverted method freaks me out because it's really easy to make a horrible mess and or burn yourself by flipping this thing around and things popping out, so do be very careful. So you can preheat the AeroPress, you can make sure your filter is nice and rinsed and ready to go. Get your scales, add your 18 grams of coffee, and hit zero. So we're gonna add 90 grams of water now, which will give us about 70 grams out when we press 'cause some will be absorbed by the coffee. And we're gonna need to stir to make sure all of the coffee is getting wet. Now, it will be a bit clumpy because it's reasonably finally ground. So you do want to be a little bit aggressive in your stirring. Lid on, filter on. Now, we're gonna steep this for 90 seconds, which seems like a really long time in the world of espresso, but this isn't the world of espresso. We're not looking at 30 second brew times here. We need to do a lot of extraction with not much liquid. That's a real challenge here. After 90 seconds, we're gonna invert. I would say cup on first, give it a flip, give it a little swirl to make sure we've got no grounds stuck to the side, and then give it just a second to have the grounds settle towards the bottom. We're gonna press very gently. If we push too hard, we might effectively create a channel in that coffee bed and cause some under extraction. So we want quite a gentle pressing. There's no need to get crazy with it. You've got time, it's okay. And usually I would say don't push all the way till the bubbling hits at the end, but here we need every gram of liquid. We want to hear that bubbling hiss. And here we go. We have 65 to 70 grams of very strong coffee. Perfect for diluting with some delicious milk, but we'll get to that in a minute. I really like the moka pot, but I don't always enjoy the way a lot of people like to use it to make coffee. You can end up with something very strong, but very bitter. We're gonna be using this in a kind of similar way to the way I recommend using a moka pot in the video you can see up here, with a few small twists. Now moka pots are designed broadly speaking to do a kind of ten to one ratio. If you fill a moka pot to just below its over pressure valve, in this case that would be about 200 mills of water and this basket holds about 20 grams of coffee. We don't want all of that water to go through all of that coffee. In fact, we're gonna dose again 18 grams into this basket. So here's the twists, we're gonna be using that finer grind setting we talked about, finer than most people use when they use pre-ground coffee from the supermarket. That means that if we pushed all of the water through it, that would definitely over extract. We do not want to do that. We wanna aim for that same kind of 65 to 70 grams of water through. So here's a quick run through, start to finish. Fill it with freshly boiled water to just below the valve, grind your coffee, don't tamp it, don't mess with it, don't compact it in any way. Put it all together and put it onto medium heat and no higher than medium. Now, you're just gonna have to pay attention. You'll see that slow, beautiful stream of coffee start to appear and it will look delicious. You wanna wait until you hear that very first bubble, the very first bubbling. At that point, run it under the cold tap. Stop it as quickly as you can. At that point, you should have around 70 grams of liquid in a brewer like this of that kind of size or an appropriate amount for the size of moka pot that you're using. So far so simple. But before you go any further, before you get the milk out of the fridge or your oat milk or your soy milk or your hemp milk, any of those things, before you go down that pathway, taste the coffee. Because at this point you need to know if you've messed up. If it tastes dominantly sour and is a little bit weak and a little bit empty and hollow feeling, you didn't grind fine enough. If it is a brutal mouthful of bitterness, you've gone a bit too fine and you can go a little bit coarser next time. What you don't want to do is prep a bunch of milk, finish the drink, taste it at that point and be like, \"Oh, this is disgusting. Now I have to waste the milk and the coffee.\" Give it a taste. That's what you want, you want balance. There's a touch of acidity, but it's not overwhelming. There's some nice sweetness and texture. It's a little tickle of bitterness but that's gonna be balanced really nicely in the next step with our foamed milk. Now, before we get into milk, there's two quick things I wanna talk about. Firstly, every video right now has a coffee giveaway.

Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. So milk foaming. I have three options for you at three different price points. And just so you know, this cost about 25 pounds, this cost 50 pounds, and this cost 70 pounds. All of them are cheaper than any decent espresso machine that might provide you some sort of steam with which you could steam milk. So while they do involve spending some money, they involve spending less money. Let's start with this one because it might look a little bit familiar. This is made by Bodum, the same people who make French presses. And it looks exactly like a French press, but it costs more money than a French press, which I think is a little bit cheeky. Because to be honest, it doesn't do a better job than a French press. So everything you see me do with this here, you can 100% absolutely do with a French press. So here's how it's gonna work. You add hot milk up to this line and no more. Now, in terms of milk temperature, I'll cover this very quickly now. Milk breaks at about 70 degrees Celsius. Above that temperature you permanently, irreversibly change the chemistry and taste of the milk. You begin to cause it to break down and create new and often unpleasant flavors. It gives you that kind of cooked eggy smell. You can't have a really delicious, really hot milk drink. So generally speaking, I would recommend going no higher than 65 degrees Celsius, though I'm aware with something like this, it's pretty tricky to know how hot 65 degrees Celsius is without a thermometer. So if you have one that's useful 'cause you're gonna have to heat your milk somewhere else. I trust you to get it right. I believe in you. The principle's very simple. Go like this. And you end up with a sort of reasonably foamy thing that's kind of okay actually, it's not the worst. I have a stainless steel pitcher here that's used for pouring latte out and I'm not gonna claim that I'm gonna be able to pour beautiful late out because I'm not, this is foamed in a French press. But the texture's okay. Nothing fancy, nothing special. You could pour kind of like a simple Monk's head or something like that quite easily. Your Rosetta would not go well. How does this taste? Actually, like the foam isn't perfect by any stretch, but it's got a nice moussey texture that would make for a reasonable cappuccino. There's a nice pleasant, strong coffee taste here as you'd expect from a drink like that. Not bad. With a French press and a moka pot or an AeroPress you can get a really surprisingly good cappuccino like thing that I think you'd really enjoy. And again, at this point, I will reiterate, you can use oat milk, soy milk, any of the other milks you want to alongside dairy if you don't want to do dairy. What I would say is definitely go for the barista style versions of those things. They tend to foam better and have a better texture when hot from a kind of replication of that fatty richness that whole milk has. Let's move on to some fancier things. Now going into this I thought this next contender was just ridiculous. It's 50 pounds and it doesn't do that much, but I kind of like it. I like it more than I thought I would. The way that these work is interesting. You have essentially a kind of kettle with a hot jacket and inside it, there's a little spinny frother mechanism. This one's driven by magnets inside of here, which is kind of cool. It's kind of like those little handheld whisks you used to get combined with a kettle or all in one. And the way it works is you put your milk in up to your desired level. I'm gonna go reasonably high. Put your lid on. Push go. Now this does two things. It both froths the milk, it whips in air with that little whisk, and heats it at the same time. And by combining these actions it's a little bit frustrating. You have no control over how much air goes in. You just get as much as you get. That's the one downside of these. They tend to produce more foam than you expect them to. But the quality of that foam genuinely surprised me. Oh yeah. It is a bit too foamy. So what I would say is perfectly acceptable. Get the nicest spoon you have, I've got a fancy spoon, and just get rid of that foam. You're in a kitchen in the morning, I'm sure you can find a use for milk foam. Don't just throw it down the sink. Make fancy cereal or something. And then we're gonna give it a little swirl and decant into our jug and see if we can pour anything with it. Now, again, it's a tricky texture to pour latte out with, but you might get something like a little tulip or something like that out of it. Cheers. Very good. Now, I'm not sure how much I'd advocate for you spending 50 quid on this unless you liked foamy milk drinks and you wanted them to be as easy as possible every day. It will heat milk without foaming it. I don't know why, I guess if you didn't want any foam. And it will do cold milk froth too, but it's 50 quid. There are cheaper ones, there are more expensive ones. I was probably very anti-these. I am a lot less anti-these than I was, but it's still 50 quid. That's a lot of money for a slightly fancy kettle and a whisk. There's one more option I wanted to get and look at and talk about. And this is called the Bellman. All this does is make steam for foaming milk. That's its whole purpose. It's 70 pounds online and it works in a reasonable way. You've got a lid and inside you put your water, not too much water, not too little water, put it back together. Once it's tightened up again, nice and tight, you put it on the heat. And the water inside boils, turns to steam, the steam gets trapped and then you can just tap it off here to your steam wand with your little steam valve. So far so good. This is the only option really that will let you separate foaming, adding of air, from heating. The way the steam ones work is that when you're steaming with them, at the start of the process, you have the wand right on the surface of the milk. When it's there, you'll hear it's there. You get a kind of slurping sound as it whips in the air. You can do as much of that as you want to create as much foam as you want. And then as quickly as possible really, you wanna get the wand under the surface of the milk and have that steam act to sort of move that milk around, roll it around, smash the big bubbles that you made at the start down to being so small that you can't see them. On paper this is the most capable of all of the ways in terms of producing the best possible texture, producing the best latte art if you wanna do that at home, that this is definitely it. But it will probably drive you crazy before then. This thing is a little scary, a little frustrating, and a little bit just awkward all in one. First things first, this is a pressured vessel. Pressured vessels are scary things. Fear them. In your life look after them, treat them well. Moka pots are pressure vessels as well. This is a much, much bigger version of that. They say put it on medium high heat for five minutes. There's no gauge here. There's no information. You have no idea how hot this thing is. You have no idea how much steam pressure is inside of it. You have no idea when you have enough steam pressure to steam milk. I, while I was testing this, would regularly just open the valve a little bit to see how much steam was coming out and try and kind of gauge whether that was enough to foam good milk from, you know, having used commercial machines for years and years and years. Often I guessed wrong. There wasn't enough steam. I would start to steam a pitcher of milk and it would go wrong. There just wasn't enough pressure inside of it. I just didn't really enjoy it, but you could probably get some very good results from it with a little bit of work and a little bit of effort. So it works okay, I just wouldn't strongly recommend it. Now, as a final little FAQ, when it comes to coffee brewing you could use other methods, but I would always recommend something that has percolation and a bit of pressure.", "videoID": "ZgIVfU0xBjA"}, {"title": "Making Coffee In A Clear Glass Moka Pot", "text": "Today we gonna talk about a moka pot. Now, if you start making videos on YouTube, reviewing stuff, very quickly, people will start sending you emails saying, \"Hey can I send you a free thing? \"Can you review it?\" And a lot of it is either completely irrelevant to what you do, or it's not really stuff you wanna review, or they're just trying to get you to give them good a review, discount codes for the audience. It's just, you just say no. The whole point of the Patreon was so I don't have to deal with these stuff. But once in a blue moon, you get an email that says, \"Hey, do you wanna try this thing?\" And you look at the thing, and you're like, \"Yeah, I kinda do, that looks, in a good way, \"kind of ridiculous.\" And that's what happened here. So, I didn't pay for this. These are about 25 pounds on Amazon, so they're not expensive. They sent one of these and the reason that I wanted to play with it is that it is, as you can see, a clear glass moka pot. And I thought, maybe that'll look cool. Now, this is not gonna be a how to make a moka pot video because I've already made that video. I made it with the wonderful people ChefSteps - I can pop this in? - Yep, So when you put it together, just grab a towel because the bottom is gonna be hot now. I'll stick a link to that in the description down below. If you wanna know how to make a moka pot on my recommendations, go check that out after this. Well this is a very quick review because frankly, there's not a lot you can say about these things. Now this is mostly an aluminum in construction and if I'm honest, it feels a little cheap. It's 25 pounds so it is cheap and it feels a little cheap. The threading, doesn't feel fantastic. The way that the little basket in here sits, it's actually quite difficult to get it out of the main body sometimes, it sits a little bit too deep in there. And the sort of basket lip doesn't sit over the edge of this properly, so it's a little frustrating to empty, it's aluminum so you can't put it in the dishwasher, it'll tarnish and get weird. So it's a hand-wash only thing. It doesn't work on induction hubs, which is all I have here, but there's a way around that. It's construction is okay, like the lid there's like a little band here to try and keep this in place. It doesn't work super well. I wish they'd made it out of better materials, a better gauge of material, it just feel just a little too light for me. You are getting what you pay for here. This is a pretty cheap little moka pot, but half of it glass. Maybe that's cool, maybe we should see what happens when you brew with one of these things. If you do want one, I'll leave a link in the description down below. It won't be an affiliate link, I do not want to benefit from you if you buy one of these. But really, the reason that I got one of these, the reason that you're probably watching this video, is you wanna know if it looks cool and so in the tradition of YouTube, let's finish this up with some unnecessarily cinematic shots of making coffee in a clear glass moka. I thought that would look better, I did, I thought that would look cooler. It wasn't easy to get good looking results out of this I can't quite work out why this doesn't brew a little bit like other moka pots, it seems to brew a little bit differently kind of a range of grind settings too. I don't really understand why something maybe in the way that the basket is inside this thing I don't know.", "videoID": "c7FoqR9oCfI"}, {"title": "Drinking Donuts (In Coffee)", "text": "Today we're gonna answer a question that nobody asked. Can you make a liquid taste just like a donut and can you combine it with coffee for a good time? Now I happen to know that the answer to this is yes, permit me a little story. It's 2007, I'm competing in the UK Barista Championships. I will win that year and go to the World Championships in Tokyo and I'll win that one too and if you wanna see me talk through the whole Barista Competition routine, there's a video up here. But in the UK, I was working on a signature drink. It's a drink that you make that can have alcohol in, must taste of coffee but that's really where the rules kind of end. And at that time, I was obsessed with trying to make a liquid pastry. Now initially, I was trying to replicate the taste of a kind of a laminated dough, be it like a croissant or something like that but none of it worked and there was a kind of acidity that was very unpleasant from all of the sort of fermentation of the dough. I thought I'd hit a dead end. That is, until I went to see my friend Chris Young. Now at the time, he was the head of the lab at the Fat Duck restaurant. He was doing all the kind of crazy food science. We were friends, we would hang out a little bit and he said that the pastry chef from El Bulli, Ferran Adria's restaurant in Spain at the time, probably the most famous, most kind of well-known experimental interesting restaurant in the world. Apparently, the pastry chef thought that a freshly fried and glazed Krispy Kreme original glazed donut was a perfect dessert. And in 2007, I don't think I'd had one but I went and I sought one out and yeah, fresh off the line, it was incredible. And so I began a quest to turn this into a liquid because I figured that plus coffee would be delicious. Turns out I was right and today, I'll show you the process, I'll give you the recipe. It's really very simple. On stage in the competitions, it got complicated because there was a kind of time crunch. We don't have that pressure here so we're gonna do it a much easier way. To start with you need some donuts. Now, you don't have to use Krispy Kreme, I just think they have quite a strong signature flavor. This isn't sponsored by them in any way, you could use whatever donuts you wanna use, if you like the flavor of those donuts. I just think these are easy to find. Now I've gone for the vegan version today 'cause I'm kind of curious. So I'm gonna do a vegan version but you could do this with a regular version and dairy milk, that works just fine, up to you. This is the recipe. For every 100 mils of milk that you're gonna use, you're gonna use one donut. So here, I'm gonna keep things simple. I'm gonna do four donuts to 400 mils of liquid. Take your donuts, chop them into little pieces. I would say probably eight pieces is enough. You're gonna squish, smoosh these things once they're in the liquid so don't worry too much about it. And they need a bit of a squish to get them all in. Let's do three more. And then just 400 mils, in this case, of milk or plant-based milk. Combine and then we're gonna gently heat it and give it a good smoosh together. It's gonna become a slightly unsettling soupy mix. Don't freak out, this is totally fine. Don't worry about that at all. You're gonna heat it up, not too hot. I don't wanna get to the point where the milk has started to cook and change its taste or kind of texture. So here, I would say probably 40 to 50 degrees Celsius, just heat it up gently and then let it infuse for maybe 20 minutes. Okay, so it's time to do the first straining. Now, you're gonna be a little unsettled because it kinda looks a bit porridgy at this point, don't worry. By the time we get it to a drink, it'll be clean and delicious and wonderful but we are gonna have to do a little bit of straining. Now, ideally, have a biggest sieve than mine 'cause what we're gonna need to do is let's take a little at a time and then we kinda wanna squeeze and press it out. All of the liquid that's inside, the sort of soggy donut, we need that out 'cause that's the best tasting liquid of all. So we're gonna gently press it through and then whatever's left, I mean you could eat it, I wouldn't but you could. So here we have round one. Now, if we just steamed this and put it into coffee, the texture is actually not that good. The little tiny bits of dough still in there, it needs a fine strain. It's actually a little bit too kind of fatty and kind of greasy like this. So it needs a second kind of cleaning up and separation. Now in the competition, I took a slightly extreme route, which was I put it into a centrifuge, running at -20 degrees Celsius to very quickly chill down any fat there, to be sort of more solid and then spin it out quite easily and that definitely worked. A little bit of chaos to try and use the centrifuge onstage at that time. Also, the company that hired that to me were kind of grossed out that I was doing this with it but that's by the by. We could use a centrifuge but that just seems a bit extreme for something that is just kind of a little bit of fun and a silly thing to make for some friends. What we're gonna do, it's much simpler. We're just gonna chill it down, chill it down, fridge temp, sort of four degrees Celsius ideally and leave it until that kind of fat will solidify a little bit more, it'd be much easier to strain out. So I'm gonna leave this in the fridge for a little while and will come back to it later. This recipe, all the instructions, all that kinda stuff is on my website.

Thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. We return. We've had a sort of a good chilling down and you can actually see on top of here, there's been a little bit of sort of separation and solidifying of some of the oil inside this whole thing and that's good news. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna sieve this a couple of times. Firstly, just to do a kind of quick pass through the sieve, we'll probably catch some lumps of stuff. We can get rid of that and then we'll do a finer sieve again afterwards. And so that's a pretty good start. We could go finer again in terms of sieving to get a better end texture and kind of cleaner tasting drink in a way. Now you could use muslin if you wanted to use that, for me, I don't love using that, I think it's super effective and you could use a coffee filter paper but that tends to take forever. So from Dave Arnold, I learned this trick, a tea towel. A clean tea towel is actually a pretty good filtration medium for this kind of stuff, which is what we're gonna do. Now, the more you sieve this, the cleaner will get and the more enjoyable it will be to drink, for sure. It's pretty delicious right now but if you've got a fine sieve, definitely use that. The finer the sieve, the better. For now, we're gonna run with it. We're gonna keep it simple, nice and easy. I'm gonna steam this up, pour it into a little bit espresso drink. For ours shot, I'm gonna use a double here, just 'cause I'm not gonna have this very often so I might as well do it right. This, as I recall, is quite difficult to steam, you gotta be quite aggressive at the start to get some air into it and then you should be okay. Now obviously this liquid has a slightly higher fat content so it is harder to to pour, the foam's a little bit more fragile and you can go from anywhere from a one-to-one to one to two, in terms of the amount of liquid you're gonna add in. I never got good latte out with this back in the day. So here we have coffee and a donut, all in one. A nice layer of firm, sweet, donuty milk, a delicious espresso. Let's have a taste. It's like, it's almost too obvious in terms of what it is. It tastes exactly like you think it would taste. It tastes like I'm drinking a Krispy Kreme original glazed donut with a delicious shot of espresso in there too. Now this is not crazy sweet and so I would say adding about five grams of sugar per 100 mils of liquid will get you to a pretty tasty point. If you'd like something a little bit more decadent, it's just like drinking a pastry and you could argue, why not just eat the pastry but sometimes it's fun to have fun. That's all I'm saying. It's fun to have fun, fun to do something different, fun to surprise your friends with a weird little drink that really anyone could enjoy. If they like coffee, if they like donuts, they'll enjoy this. It'll be a surprise, a treat, some fun. But now I wanna hear from you. What'd you try this? Does this sound like fun? Does this sound just completely ridiculous? If you do try it, leave us a comment down below.", "videoID": "j-_E7R-Eu_w"}, {"title": "Five (Coffee) Predictions for 2019", "text": "So it's time for the 2019 predictions and to be honest going into this year it feels like a world in flux, a world that's very very difficult to make any real predictions for but I kind of enjoy these they're kind of fun so let's have a go anyway. So here's five predictions to do with coffee that I think could be a thing in 2019 Let's start at the beginning, let's start with coffee equipment, let's start with espresso machines. Now, 2019 is a year where HOST is on. HOST is every two years, it's a massive trade show in Italy in Milan where espresso machine manufacturers come and show off their latest and greatest. it's a kind of major moment in the calendar for every single espresso machine manufacturer. What I think we'll see this year is a big swing towards automation and I'll tell you why: Eversys. Eversys have had an incredible couple of years, they've taken on a bunch of money. They've got themselves sorted out, their products are really well received and they really seem relatively uncontested in the specialty super-automatic world. It's kind of Eversys and then a big gap and then everyone else, certainly in specialty coffees perceptions I don't think the the other manufacturers are gonna let Eversys continue without some serious challenge. So I suspect we'll see a ton of innovation in that particular area. Every year I like to throw in a kind of business here prediction and for the UK, well, if Brexit happens - which still feels like a weird if - it will be brutal. Brutal to coffee and I'll tell you why: One, we already have what we call pretty low consumer confidence; people are eating and drinking out less already. If a hard Brexit happens it's only gonna get worse. Couple that with, I suspect, an even greater fall in the value of our currency... Well, prices are going to be going up for cafes, consumers may be hesitant to spend more someone's gonna get caught in the middle. So, however you feel about this political nonsense if Brexit happens it is it is just bad for the coffee industry full stop. For my third prediction I want to talk about alternative milk.", "videoID": "BmlBxJOb1lY"}, {"title": "Can Coffee-Colas Be Good\uff1f", "text": "Welcome to coffee drinks that I drink so you don't have to. And in this week, we have a head to head. We have the behemoth of the soft drink world, the $30 billion Coca-Cola bringing us something a little special. It's a coffee Cola. Coca-Cola in Italy have put coffee in their Cola. We'll come back to you in a second. This contender, I suppose, is Fritz Cola, German based, and this is their caramel coffee Cola. Now, this is interesting. A lot of people for a long time have talked about mixing coffee and Cola. I just never quite got it in my head to sound good. So I'm hesitant, skeptical, nervous, those things. Coca Cola is I think, a thing of beauty. It is a technological marvel in some ways. It is beautifully composed. Coca-Cola has become its own flavor, Cola flavor. No one can really tell you what Coca-Cola tastes of. No one can break it to pieces because they blended the flavors so beautifully that all you taste is the kind of combination, that kind of gushed out flavor. So you don't taste orange or lime or lemon or nutmeg or cinnamon or neroli oil. Those flavors are there, but you just can't get them. It's a beautifully composed thing. And so I'm hesitant that coffee will be a positive addition, and not just disruptive to that balance. Now, how you feel about them as a company is more complicated. How you feel about the healthfulness of Coca-Cola is a separate deal, but I think it's a very clever product. Fritz, I don't know that much about. From memory, it's a little bit more citrus skewed. You know typically competing products tend to be a little heavy on one flavor characteristic. You know, if you think about competing Ketchups to Heinz. Heinz is your benchmark and others will be sweeter or more vinegary. And the same thing with Colas. Typically, they're too limey, they're too clovey or cinnamony or something like that. From memory, it's a little lemon heavy, but I could be wrong. Still, I think an independent business. So this, it's still, it's a good sized company from what I can tell, but it's, I think still independently owned. Someone in the comments will correct me if I'm wrong on that. But they both got coffee Colas. And they both might be good and they both might be disgusting. I just don't know. I just don't know. And so I've made them cold. I guess we should, I guess we should drink the Coca-Cola. That's a great sound, isn't it? Ooh, ah. So, okay, I need a bottle opener. You know there are always people that can just open bottles of stuff with anything they have to hand. I am not one of those people, I need a bottle opener. Trusty spoon. I feel like the incumbent should go first. Coca-Cola plus coffee. Oh God, wish me luck. No, no. What is wrong with you? You have one of the most beautifully composed soft drinks in the world. The coffee taste is bad. It's got like a little dirty, very low quality tiramisu about it. That's sort of where I'm at with this one. That is bad. That is not good. We'll come back to you in a second. Okay, it's not great. I'm not sure it's even good but it's not bad. Lavishing praise on the Fritz-kola today. So the coffee flavor in here is much more subtle. To me, it's that slightly rough end of coffee, not the interesting, pretty, sweet end of coffee. It's a Cola coffee lemonade with caffeine. This is a thing for them, actually. There's quite a lot of caffeine in this. This is like a good dose of caffeine. Which who cares? And it just tastes like a slightly odd Cola where that kind of caramel quality to Cola turns into a sort of dirty coffee flavor. This. Oh, it's like you took a really great painting and just dogged over it with dirt and mud. You know what I mean? Just obscured anything charming or pretty or a desirable or pleasurable about it with mud, with filth. This is just awful. It takes all the good points and all of that is smothered with dirty, dirty coffee water taste. It's very bad. It's very bad. Really? I just blows my mind that you couldn't do better than that, Coca Cola. I think if you released that in Italy, I think it's almost offensive to Italians that you think that their coffee is that bad. Fritz wins. Well done, Fritz-kola. For, not bad. Bad, not not bad, not bad. I mean, not good, actually, well. Do I like anything? I do, I do like things, I do like things. Alright, that's it for me, that's it.", "videoID": "ROumwg6ML9Y"}, {"title": "Why is a cup of coffee so expensive\uff1f", "text": "Now, not everyone feels this way, but it's not uncommon for me to hear from people that coffee has gotten pretty expensive. And to be fair to them, it did used to be much cheaper to buy a cup of coffee. That's changed as the coffee boom has happened in cities around the world. And at a time when there are increasing numbers of articles highlighting the fact that coffee growers aren't getting paid the cost of production for their coffee, that it's become unsustainable, well, this rising price of coffee leaves many people with questions that should be answered. So that's what we're gonna do today. We're going to talk about where your money goes when you spend it on a cup of coffee in a specialty cafe. To do that, we're gonna have to talk in generalities. We're gonna have to talk about the business model of cafes, and it's impossible to be completely accurate because every business is a little bit different. And also to begin with, we're just gonna talk about the UK, which is obviously different in some ways than other places. You go and you spend three pounds on a cup of coffee in a good cafe. Well, where does that money go? Well, in the UK, the VAT, the tax rate, on coffee is 20%. So 50p of your three pounds goes straight to the government. The net revenue for the cafe is only two pounds 50. So, let's divide that two pounds 50. In a cafe, about 30% of the money that our cafe takes in goes back out to product cost, cost of buying the things that you ultimately end up selling. About 35% of its money goes to pay staff. 15% of its revenue will go towards paying the rent and associated location costs. Maybe 10% will go towards general overheads, from lighting to heating to administration, leaving 10%, on a good day, as profit for the owner. That's 25 pence on a three pound cup of coffee, which means you've gotta make a lot of cups of coffee to really make any money. I should also add, that around the world, those models will vary. In some places, let's say Shanghai, you might have a very high rent and a much lower staff cost, but, by and large, around the world, the net profit remains the same. It's not uncommon to be making 10 to 12% profit and doing better than that these days is really pretty unusual. As I said, this is the typical kind of business model for a specialty cafe. There will be some variants. Some cafes will pay more to staff, some pay less. Some will pay more rent, some will pay less. Wait, wait, wait, you might say, if I go to a nice cafe and I buy a four pound cup of filter coffee, there's no way that there's one pound of product cost, even if they're using good quality coffee and paying a sustainable price. And you're right, that 30% of product cost is the average across the board. A cup of filter coffee, you may make a much higher margin, compared to, say, a pastry that you might buy with it that has a much, much, much lower margin, a much higher cost associated with it. So once we break apart the costs of a cafe, you can see what's really driving the increase in a price of a cup of coffee. The cost of hiring and retaining staff has really increased a lot in the last few years, especially as coffee cultures have become increasingly competitive. The more cafes that open, the more baristas are needed, the more demand the market sees, and that drives up the prices for skilled, capable baristas. This has meant that the staff cost for cafes has constantly crept up and up and up and up and up. When I first got into the business, it was only down at 25%. Now it's easily 35% plus, that really has changed. And I think anyone in any city in the world knows that landlords have been greedy and continue to be greedy. But let's talk a little bit more about the coffee that goes into each cup. As I said before, the actual cost of the coffee is surprisingly low. It's a very small part of the total cost for a cafe. This means that if a cafe's buying really good coffee, it doesn't actually drive their price up all that much. If you took a cafe serving a really great espresso blend, full of coffees bought ethically and sustainably, and that cafe switched to something really cheap, really commoditized, and very low quality, that cafe may save 15, maybe 20 pence of cost. That's it, that's all the saving there is to be made. It doesn't really make sense to cut those corners. It makes sense to ask the right price for something delicious, but for 20p more, for 30p more, you can have something incredible. Great coffee is actually incredibly cheap for what it is, even when you're drinking in a cafe with all the associated costs. So if you're angry at the price of a cup of coffee, that's okay, but don't be angry at the cafe. They're not exploiting you. Cafe owners are not rolling around in piles of money.", "videoID": "7SM2Jrot-ZM"}, {"title": "I Tried Every Nespresso Pod", "text": "What I have here is one sleeve of each of the different Nespresso capsules available from Nespresso's UK store, which is a lot. It's 36, and I'm gonna taste all of them. You might ask, why would I do this? And that's a good question. I'm going to go through the pros and the cons of doing this. Firstly, the pros: I'm just curious. How different are these? How much variety, how much variation in flavor do they really offer? A lot of people get angry with my opinions about Nespresso, arguing that I just haven't tried the right capsule or I'm uninformed and to some extent, I might agree. I haven't tasted everything and so if I wanna understand what people love about this, I should approach it with an open mind. They sell something like 14 billion (billion!) of these things a year. Understanding this is important. And now for the cons. Well, firstly, Nespresso is owned by Nestle and Nestle is a company that has done and seems to continue to do indefensible things, and I'm always nervous about talking about them in what might be construed as a positive or promotional way. That isn't really the intention here. The last big con, of course, is that 36 cups of coffee is not good for the human. I will be tasting, but I'll be spitting it out. I'll be rinsing my mouth out. I'll be sparing you those visuals and details, don't you worry about it, but I still might feel pretty weird from caffeine consumption, so I'm kind of nervous in that regard. I'm gonna try and score each of these in a way that I hope is vaguely useful to you. I'm going to indicate a level of roast from 1 to 10, how roasty are these, and then for my second kind of rating, complexity, interestingness, are they kind of generic coffee tasting? That would score very low, or do they have some complexity, some character to them, that's kind of individual to the pod? That would score much higher. Without further ado, let's begin. So the Cosi is the lightest, I suppose, of these. It's four out of 12 on the strength rating. I would say it's still medium, a developed, darker, medium style roast. They talk about jammy fruit. I'd get none. They talk about cereals. I get some. So I would say on the roast level, for me, it'd be like probably a five out of 10. I know it's going to get much, much darker, so I need to leave some space. Complexity, honestly, like a three. Yeah, just kind of generic, slightly cereally coffee. So this is Chiaro, which means light. There's no strength rating on this one, which is kind of interesting. They say it's designed for working with milk, which seems weird for one you would call light. So this is kind of the same level of roast, almost like it's not particularly dark, I would say, in the five out of 10, maybe even lower. It tastes like the coffees in that are lower altitude, so it's got a heaviness and a total lack of acidity, very generic coffee taste though, probably a two out of 10. There's not a ton of characteristics in there. That's kind of mind-bending. Kenyan and Indonesian coffees mixed together, I would have expected kind of fruit and body. There is no fruit. From the translation, one might expect some whimsy, not sure we're going to get that. It's supposed to be South American Arabicas, the least traceable origin description I think I've ever heard, and I think a little bit of robusta from nowhere in particular, still though, distinct cereal notes. That sounds charming. It's darker on the roast level, maybe a six out of 10 now. Again, maybe three out of 10 on interestingness. Yeah, it tastes like slightly burnt, exceedingly bland granola. The description says sweet biscuit and I can't get past biscuit, though I wouldn't say particularly sweet. The thing about these, this is, again, maybe like a four or five out of 10 on roast and a two or three out of 10 on complexity or character. If you like these, I completely understand why, because there's nothing wrong with them. There's no defective or unpleasant tastes in them. They're just not very complex or interesting. This has tasted, in some ways, very similar to everything else I've tasted so far, which is beginning to stress me out. So this is the same pod as the previous one, but decaffeinated, and it has absolutely no aroma, which is interesting. Impressively, this tastes exactly like the previous pod which I guess is easy as there's not a ton of complexity, but it is kind of biscuit-y and a little bit roasty, but not really roasty, just like a little bit roasty, not particularly sweet, no acidity, but really, really like the caffeinated version, so I guess well done Nespresso there. So this is another Barista Creation, this is Corto, and this seems to suggest that you, being a barista, you're going to do some recipe-making, you're gonna steam some milk. You can add 10 to 20 mls of hot milk, a couple of spoonfuls of foam on top, and thusly, it will have made a traditional macchiato, I guess. It's got some punch. It's got some impact. I could definitely see why you might want milk with this. Maybe seven, eight out of 10 on the roast scale. I will say this tastes more of coffee from somewhere. You can taste the robusta in there. I would give it maybe a four out of 10 for complexity, woody, spicy, earthy, roasty, a little bitter, no acidity. It's a big, heavy, heavy thing. So another Barista Creation this time, Scuro, which means darkness, so that, from a roasting perspective, makes me nervous. They say like a 25 ml ristretto style thing with some milk, 'cause this is for milk drinks. I think that's the vibe here. That's weird, not super roasty, like a four, maybe five out of 10. Character, maybe a six. It tastes like stale berry-flavored cereal. Now, we're going to move into the single origin stuff, where, honestly, I have higher hopes. So this is a black honey process, so after the fruit has been depulped, a lot of mucilage has been left on there. Typically, you'd expect some fermented kind of notes in those kinds of coffees. They're, once again, promising, can you guess it, cereal. The good news is you can taste a little of that fermented kind of character of a black honey that you often get. It's pretty smothered. It's pretty pushed down. It's just really roasty over the top, and that feels like a shame. You've got an interesting process from an origin that you're not really showcasing. Roast level, like a six at this point. Character, kind of a five, but a disappointed five. No, I'm revising that back down to a four. So four for character. It really is too subtle, and that's such a shame. Master Origins Indonesia, now I could have gone for an espresso or a lungo. I felt an espresso was really the way to go. Roast levels, definitely creeping up there. I'm going to say seven out of 10, and to be honest, that's really impacted the characterfullness of the coffee. Wet-hulled coffees from Sumatra, which is what this is and where this is from, can be really characterful. It's a bit Marmite; some people really hate it, some people love it. But that kind of vegetal, earthy, heavy thing that you get is there, but it's really muted and turned down, and I feel like if you like that, you'd be left wanting more, and if you don't like that, then you're not going to enjoy it anyway, and it just sits in the middle and doesn't have an opinion, and I want it to have an opinion, have an opinion. You know, with this Ethiopian capsule, I feel like they could really break my heart because if there's one origin that is a great stepping stone to get people excited about single-origin coffees, I think Ethiopia is definitely one of the obvious choices. Now, this is a natural process, a dry processed coffee, so we should get a ton of fruit. They're promising orange blossom and rich fruit jam. That's exciting. That's not terrible news. It's a little roasty still, like a five or six out of 10, but character is absolutely there. You can taste that it's a natural process really clearly. That's good. So I'm gonna give you like an eight out of 10 for character. This, if you gave it to somebody and were like, \"Does this taste like coffee?\" They'd be like, \"Ooh, I don't think it does, it tastes kind of weird. I don't know what that is.\" That's really important. That's really useful. I think that's a good thing. This is, by far, by far the most interesting capsule so far. It doesn't come close to what Ethiopian coffees are capable of, which still kind of bums me out. So going into this Colombian capsule, you should know that I have a slight bias probably towards Colombian coffees. Some of my favorite coffees have been from there. I love the diversity of the country's profiles. You can go from heavy, rich, chocolatey, through to jammy, through to light and bright and almost citrusy. What will they pick as their kind of quintessentially Colombian profile? So there's good and bad here. That's the first time I've thought about acidity in this whole tasting so far. This is the first coffee and I'm like, oh, oh, a little fruit acid. That's kind of nice. It's upfront roast and a little acid behind it, a little fruit in there too. Six out of 10 for me on the roast level. It's present. It's not dominant dominant, but it's the first thing you'd notice. This has some character. It made me think about acidity and fruit and that's good. So I'll give it a seven out of 10 for character. It tastes of something, of somewhere, rather than just the generic roasty cereal taste. So this has a bunch of monsooned robusta, so monsooning coffee is when you leave it in a warehouse to simply absorb some moisture and the sea air often. You get a very, very low acidity, very heavy, often very woody profile. Robusta tends to a slightly woodier profile, compared to Arabica, so I'm expecting a lot of wood. They have this at the 11 out of 12 scale, and I'm just a little nervous of this. Oh, no. Okay, if you like this, I'm sorry. It's just really not to my taste, but that is very bitter. They're really roasty, like nine out of 10 on the roasty front. It's really harsh, no acidity. I'm not sure it has character necessarily. There's a woodiness that is just dominant to this thing, and the thing that bums me out, that makes me angry at Nespresso in this one single instance, is that someone might drink this and be like, oh, I don't like Indian coffee, and you're like, \"No, no, no, no, no, \"that is not a good representation of Indian coffee.\" This is what Nespresso thinks you should think Indian coffee tastes like. I completely disagree. So I'm not exactly sure what this one is. It makes a reference to the La Cumplida farm, but also the La Cumplida farmers, which is often how you talk about a cooperative, so I'm not entirely sure if it's a single estate or a group of producers. It's a innovative fermentation, they say. It's a natural. They're saying fruity, candy, cherry and pomegranate. It's going big, Nespresso. I appreciate your ambitions. So the first sip you're like, oh, character, fruit, fermentation, there's something going on here, and then that gives way to just a steam roller of bitterness and roast. That's such a weird experience. You get some acidity right at the start. It's punchy and sharp and interesting, and then it finishes with like a really cheap, fake strawberry ice cream, but then someone's put badly, badly, badly burnt caramel on top, and that's the combination. It's the little fruit and texture left behind the creaminess that's there, but this harsh, roasty attack, that I think smothers the character. Maybe they know better than me. Maybe they know what works with millions of people and I don't know what works for millions of people, but if you drank this and you liked it, know that the interesting thing about it, you can have so much more if you go with a lighter roast, like a less developed roast. Again, another missed opportunity to really showcase how interesting coffee can be. These next three are all from the Reviving Origins collection. This first one is from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and if I'm honest, I feel like 'Reviving Origins' is hmm, I don't love it. You know what I mean? It's reviving, bringing life back. There's a little bit of a savior undertone to that one, you could have gone with re-engaging or not abandoning anymore. Anyway, they're kind of championing their work they're doing with producers there to 'revive' the origin. I will stop rolling my eyes maybe. Tasting notes, mild, fruity note, and our favorite friend cereal is back again. Hooray. I would say a roast level of seven or eight. All I tasted is roast, kind of cereally roast. There's no character here. I'm gonna give it a two out of 10. That could be from anywhere. It just tastes like Nespresso. It doesn't taste like an origin, and that feels like a weird thing to do with a Reviving Origin series. I'm trying to think. I'm not sure I've had coffee from Zimbabwe before. I really don't think I have, so this makes this exciting for me. This is kind of a first. Not gonna lie, I did not expect Nespresso to introduce me to a new origin. Now, they're promising a lot berries, berries, berries, berries, berries. Smells a little bit like berries  Idiot. That is weird. I don't know what that is yet, and weird is good. So on the characterful level, again, seven or an eight. Roast level, six, so still a lot of roast in these, like a lot of roast. Something about this reminds me of blackberries, but also the leaves of the plants as well, something slightly vegetal and slightly planty about this, with this berry, berry quality as well. It has this super late in the game acidity, where you take a sip, you're like, okay and then, wham, this weird acidity comes out of nowhere. It's not my favorite kind of acidity. It's a little sharp and grippy and not refreshing, but a bit soury-er than the other stuff. It's definitely characterful and unusual and interesting, so tick, tick, tick from me there, but I don't love it. It makes me want to drink more coffee from Zimbabwe though. I'd love to taste a lighter roast of that and see what was really going on, 'cause that's kind of weird, but weird is good. So the last of these Reviving Origins is a coffee from Uganda and I'm happy to see a coffee from Uganda here. No, no. There are no floral characters here or characteristics. Either way, nothing's floral. That's roasty. It's just developed coffee from roasting. It's bitter. It's got a lot of texture, but it doesn't have any acidity or complexity. I would say probably a seven or an eight out of 10 on roastiness, on roast development, and maybe like a three on character. Again, Uganda can produce some incredible coffees, and I just wouldn't know that here. This just tastes of roasted coffee. That's all I taste here. It's just so bizarre. So I'm just opening this now, and I've noticed that the scale has changed. So on the little capsules, you've got your like, your scale, and this is 10 on the punchy, angry scale. This is now 10 out of 13. The capsules I tasted earlier were out of 12, and that was already ridiculous. Why is this gone to 13? That's not even a good Spinal Tap reference. That's just weird. So this is the World Exploration series. So they basically rebranded all their lungo capsules into these kind of city capsules. Now, you might quite reasonably presume that naming a blend after a city in Africa, you might put some coffees from Africa in there. No, no, no, we're gonna do just India, Arabicas and Robustas apparently, which is a bit of a surprise. I can smell the Robusta coming off this. It's pretty roasty smelling too. That's um, not my favorite so far today. That's a lot of bitterness, that's just - it's, all my brain can really get to right now is bitter, burnt tastes, like close to kinda charcoal-y, bitter tastes. There's a little bit of woodiness and the spice and earth in there too. That's a really intense old school, rough around the edges, big cup of coffee. Why did I sip that again? So this is now the Tokyo Vivalto Lungo, and I just need to read the box to you quickly, for the best accidental national compliment I've seen in awhile. Known for tea, the Japanese also have a real affinity for coffee. Sophisticated and naturally sweet, they love rich coffee with balanced, elegant aromas. Are you saying that the Japanese are sophisticated and naturally sweet? Did you just give tasting notes to the nation of Japan? This is supposed to be complex floral with a hint of acidity. So this is coffee from Ethiopia and Mexico in here, and it's got some character. It actually tastes of something. I would say roast, for them, in the middle, five, six out of 10. Character, probably seven out of 10, not superbly characterful and complex, but more so than most things that we've tasted today, if I'm honest. It's got an opinion. It's doing something a little different to the other stuff. They didn't tell me it tasted like cereal, which is frankly a treat. So the Shanghai Lungo contains three origins I don't often see together. Its coffees from Kenya, China, and Indonesia. Now, I presume, with there being Chinese coffee in here, they called it the Shanghai Lungo for that particular reason. They say it's some sort of exploration of modern Chinese coffee culture, but I'm skeptical to say the least. I feel like I'm picking on this one when I say I don't want to drink it. I think I'm reaching the point of pain with these, where I'm not having a good time. A lot happened there. I don't really know what was going on, but a lot of flavors happened. Roast level, not super high. I could smell some roast, but it's like a five out of 10 probably, on the lower end of what they do, certainly, but still unavoidable apparently. Definitely berries. So I get the Kenyan coffee in there, so there's some character. I'm going to go seven out of 10 for character, 'cause I feel like it has some character. It's a really weird blend. I'm intrigued by it. Definitely more interesting than 80% of everything else we've tasted. Do I love it? I'm not sure I do. So next up is the Stockholm Fortissio Lungo, which is honestly making me think of the syndrome more than the city right now. Oh, oh, wow, okay. Oh dear. I was thinking this is okay. It's kind of malty maybe, but I'm not getting the savory, and then I swallowed and was like, oh, no, there's the savory. It's like roast, roast, roast, savory! And I don't know, if I was from Stockholm or just Sweden in general, I would feel a little bit offended at this point, that this is what Nespresso thinks you drink and like and it best represents you. That's not for me, not for me. Next up on our trip around the world is Vienna, obviously famous for its coffee culture. These days, you can still visit very old, beautiful coffee houses, where people are allowed to smoke inside, and that's my abiding memory of those. I feel like there's something evocative of that environment in this coffee, not super dark roasted, maybe a five out of 10 for me on the roast level. There's something weird in there. Where are these coffees from? Brazil and Columbia. It doesn't taste the way I expected it to. There is some character to this, so I guess I'm gonna give this like a six. It's weird. It starts out super generic, and then just briefly has a moment of complexity or characterfullness, and then goes back to generic again, so let's bring that down to a five out of 10. I think that's where we're at. It feels a bit like it's aiming to be inoffensively coffee, and as a result, I am offended. So this one smells like robusta and roast, if I'm honest. What's my roast level? Four?! This doesn't smell like a four. Yeah, probably like a four or five on the roast front. Tasting notes, distinct cereal and sweet popcorn. Nespresso, not everything in coffee has to taste of cereal. I don't think coffee should taste of cereal. I don't think that's a delicious, enticing tasting note. I am not specifically cross with this one, but I'm just... What's with the cereal obsession? I think I'm done. I think I'm just cross enough with these that I want to stop for now, and I don't want to drink any more coffee today, so I'm just gonna stop. So I think we need to take a break for today. I think if I'm going to sleep, be human, in any way functional, I need to stop drinking coffee, even though I'm spitting it out, because I've had enough. I've had enough coffee for today. I'm not gonna mess myself up. So in a minute, I'm going to hand over to tomorrow me who will be more refreshed and ready to drink more coffee again. We've still got the Italian-inspired stuff to do, which is, I hope, interesting, and we've still got the weird flavored stuff to do, which terrifies me, and we'll do all of that after a short ad for this video sponsor, which is Squarespace.

Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. Let's get back to making some coffee. So I start today feeling nice and fresh. We start with a new category too. It's the Ispirazione Italiana, the Italian-inspired collection, and we're gonna dive in. These suggest either espresso or ristretto, so I'm gonna lean towards ristretto on most of these. Just I don't necessarily want to extract them fully, going by the previous experiences I've had, plus the ristretto, for them, is like a normal espresso to most people. Venice is up first, and interestingly, for a espresso that brews that fast, they're suggesting thick body and caramel flavor. Eight out of 13 on the roast level. Smells a little higher than that. Let's have a taste. Yup, yup, that's pretty roasty. I would go probably eight out of 10 on the roast level. It's a dominant roast flavor here. They would say caramel. I don't really get much caramel. I feel like they're not really aiming for something characterful here. They're aiming for something actually pretty generically roasty coffee, and they are succeeding, but I'd give it a three out of 10 maybe on character or complexity. It's very simple. It's very linear. It's roasted coffee, pretty dark roasted coffee, and that's kind of it. So next up, Florence. So this is their north, south blend, where they're going fruity notes from the north of Italy and then cocoa chocolate notes from the south. This is actually brewed a little slower than most of the other capsules, and it has that chocolatey thing for sure. Tons of roast in there as well. I'd say another eight out of 10 on roast. Another three out of 10 on complexity or character. It is a little chocolatier than the last one, but that's kind of it. They're really not that dissimilar. So our decaf Florence is up next so previously, the decafs had been very similar to the caffeinated versions. Interesting, it's not as good a decaffeination as the other one I had before. This is a kind of woodier version of that dark roast chocolatey thing. Roast level's the same, eight out of 10, tons and tons and tons of roast flavor. Complexity, probably again a three out of 10, just not very interesting or complex. I totally get though why this profile appeals to people. It's very thick, heavy, classic in that regard. So the Napoli is probably my most feared pod, because it goes to 13 on the strength rating or whatever rating they have here. This is all the way to the top, so this is definitely getting pulled as a ristretto. Whoever's writing the copy on this is clearly having a tremendously good time, because I just don't understand how you can claim that a blend of coffee has been leavened with Robusta. Not a lot of taste notes. Lots and lots of texture notes. Ooh I smell you. This - this er... This has been well 'leavened' with Robusta. That is potent. Heaps of roast. That is incredibly bitter. That is dominantly bitter, but still has some flavor. So I'm going to go 10 out of 10 on the roastiness level, but at the same time, character, maybe a four, because the Robusta is so obvious. This feels like a almost dominantly Robusta espresso here. It's all I taste, is that kind of woodiness, that earthy, slightly rubberiness of a classic Robusta profile. This is very old school Robusta. I don't want to take a second sip. We travel now to Rome, where I'm told to expect finesse, deep flavor and a spiking of acidity in there, which is a lot of promises. Going to give it a seven out of 10 on the roastiness and maybe a two out of 10 on character. That is an incredibly characterless espresso to me actually. I don't get deep flavor or finesse in there. I get very linear coffeeness. Again, like a lot of these capsules, it's not flawed necessarily. If you like a roastier coffee profile, you'd probably quite enjoy it, but I just don't get any complexity whatsoever out of this, any real character at all. I think you could have more fun. So the next step is Palermo, which seems to be very similar in promise to the Napoli pod, really roasty, apparently 12 out of 13 so not as intense, but also stating there's a high Robusta content and some thick, thick, dark crema, which we have. They want it to be woody and spicy, which the subtext for me is this might hurt you a little bit and you might like it, you might not. Oh, oh, that's the one. That's the one. That's my least favorite today by quite a long way. That is hugely bitter. There is a ton of Robusta flavor in there. It is very dark roasted as well. I don't know how this rates 12 and the other one rates 13. That is lingering and brutal. That is a 10 out of 10 on roast. I don't even know how to score that on complexity, 'cause that has a ton of character that I don't like at all. It's just me. I don't like that profile at all. You might. I just really don't, and so I have to give it a three out of 10. It's a lot of what people might expect cheap coffee to taste like ultimately, and that's interesting that they're doing this in a premium package, as a premium product, at a premium price, but that's not a premium coffee experience to me at all. That's a very traditional, commoditized, old school, cheap coffee espresso experience. So the last of the cities today is Genova. From the north, so we're expecting a lighter roast and that's what we have. They have a six out of 13 on the rating, and our good friend, the cereal tasting note, is back. That is unexpectedly bitter, kind of harsh. I get where they're going with cereal. I'm going to say a seven out of 10 on the roastiness scale. It's a little bit cereally. It's not particularly caramelly, not the way that coffee can be caramelly. I'm kind of intrigued by these showcasing the diversity of Italian espresso by basically doing two different styles. So we move from Italian city inspiration into just apparently drink inspiration. This is the Ristretto capsule, which is a weird movement. I get the Ristretto is an Italian drink, or is Italian in origin, but thematically bizarre. Interestingly, they're claiming it as sort of dual roasted. They're saying long roasted - for kind of body, so a pretty drawn out roasting process, and then short roasted for fruit. Big roast, nine out of 10, very roasty, tons of texture, very fluffy actually, not thick and syrupy, but more fluffy and moussey, and then it's gone and you're left with a bitter aftertaste, but it's not like a mouth-coating syrupy thing. That's a weird textual experience. I'm going to say nine out of 10 on the roast level, two out of 10 on the complexity level. So another Ristretto pod, but this time decaf. There's been one hit, one miss, in terms of replicating the original flavor on the decaf version so far. Will this be very similar? Do I want them to succeed? I don't know. Well, that's unexpected. I like that more than the caffeinated one. It's got a little acidity to it. It's got a little bit more complexity. I don't know why. I think I definitely prefer the decaf version, so I guess a point there for that. Probably an eight out of 10 on roast, but it doesn't feel quite as punishing. It's got more complexity, like a four out of 10 maybe. I feel like points to Nespresso for doing a pretty good job of replicating the caffeinated versions in their decaf versions, less points though for offering a good level of diversity to decaf drinkers, in terms of coffee's flavor. That, I feel like, is an opportunity they haven't really taken yet, and I hope they do. So this is the first of two limited edition in the Italian-inspired range, and I'm excited for both of them. So this is the Novecento. So this is like a kind of capturing of the 1900s of coffees. So this is old school basically. It's inspired by Italian history. It's got a good kick of robusta in it. This is like your classic, classic profile, as Nespresso see it. That's interesting. They give it a nine out of 13 on the whole whatever scale. I would be seven to eight on the roastiness level. I thought it would be roastier than that. There is a good hit of classic, but pretty clean robusta in there. It's not defective, lower quality stuff, that really gets very rubbery or almost moldy tasting. It's classic robusta espresso flavor. That's the kind of, not quintessential Italian espresso, but that's an interesting caricature of that idea in a pod, and so in contrast to the old school, this is their version of the new school. This is Millennio. This is the modern coffee movement thing. So they're saying it's lighter roasts, Brazils and Colombian coffees with some coffee from India too in there. I don't know if that's really, on paper, representative of, you know, modern specialty coffee. I feel like that would be a lot of high grown, very clean, bright fruited, central American coffees as espresso. I feel like that's really the quintessential taste of modern espresso to me. I'm kind of surprised they didn't use cereally here, because this definitely tastes like cereal. They say fruity. I get almost no fruit. It is very linear. It's not particularly roasty. I'd go maybe six out of 10 for them on that scale. It's not particularly sweet or complex actually, maybe like a four out of 10 on that front as well. I can't really taste any real character of the coffees. They feel very similar in a way in the blend. I can't tell what's doing what, and I feel like modern coffee is about transparency of flavor, and so you can taste what each component is doing in the blend. That's what the fun part of modern blends often is, and this is disappointing in some ways, because we've seen a ton of modern specialty roasters put great coffees into Nespresso compatible pods. Those are much more representative, I feel, of the modern coffee movement than this particular pod is, which is just a lighter roasted Nespresso pod, but it's really missing the joy of the diversity of flavor that we tend to drink and enjoy in modern specialty. We're into the home stretch now, and we've moved into the three last pods, which are all essentially flavored coffee, and so here, wow, I have the vanilla eclair, which is basically just a pod with vanilla flavor in it. Cheers. We're not gonna give scores anymore. It's weird that I'm usually tasting vanilla and coffee with a ton of sugar in there as well, and without the sugar, it doesn't work for me. I feel like that's very, very woody. You get that hit of almost vanillin, that fake vanilla flavor, and you don't get the kind of prunier, fruitier, richer tones of vanilla. It just goes from that to kind of woodiness. Our second flavor is Caramel Creme Brulee. It's caramel, it's basically - I don't know why they put the creme brulee in. I think that's overselling this thing. It's just coffee with the most obvious caramel flavor added to it. If you've had fake caramel flavor in anything, you know exactly what's going on here. That presents much sweeter, like much sweeter. It doesn't linger like sugar, but it has almost like a... that caramel quality, just gives your brain this pop of sweetness. It works much better. It's not a great caramel flavor, but it's certainly more enjoyable than the vanilla, and so we come to the end of our journey with the Cocoa Truffle pod. Obviously, there's chocolate flavor or cocoa flavor added to this. Thankfully, I've managed to find one more pod, where they're proudly telling me it tastes like cereal. Anyway, chocolatey thing, I don't care anymore. That is awful. What is going on there? That tastes off to me. That does not taste right. That does not - That is a disservice to coffee and to chocolate, if I'm honest. Maybe it somehow works in milk, but that is the weirdest pod so far, by a mile. It's almost, it's kind of a roastiness and kind of off, ferment to the point of slight moldiness almost in there. The chocolate is barely chocolate. That's just really wrong. It is not rich and reminiscent of a dark chocolate truffle. That's really, I really don't like that. So there it is. There is every single Nespresso pod I could buy, and I'm not sure I've had a lot of fun, but I've learned a ton, and it's really interesting to see one of the biggest coffee companies in the world showcase coffee's flavor or kind of not. Here's the takeaway from this, for me. If you like any of these pods, especially some of the ones that I didn't like, but even if you like some of the ones that I do like, great news. For less money per gram, you can buy a lot more of what you like and less of what you don't. Not only are there good coffees in Nespresso compatible pods, but outside of the Nespresso world, there's some amazing coffee, that I think if you liked any of these coffees that I tasted, any of the 36, then there's such a fun journey ahead of you, if you wanna take it, that's not expensive, that is fun, that is relatively low risk. There's just so much more diversity than what you've tasted within Nespresso, than what they offer, and that's very exciting. Even in the darker roasted end or the lighter roasted end or something in between, that's the lesson here of if you love Nespresso, I have no issue with that, and I don't think you're wrong for enjoying it, and just 'cause our tastes don't line up, there's no judgment here, we just like different things, that's okay, but I am 100% confident that you could find something you love 10 times more, that is 10 times more fun and that, to me, is the exciting bit of coffee. Now, I wanna hear from you down in the comments below. Do you drink Nespresso? Do you have a favorite? Did your experience of that favorite differ from mine? Do you think I was unfair? Did I just have a very different tasting experience to you? I want to hear from you.", "videoID": "EvMwNnAtTL8"}, {"title": "The DF64\uff1a Niche Killer\uff1f", "text": "Hi there. Today, we're gonna look at this little grinder right here. It is the DF64, or the G-iota, or the Solo, or the Turin. It has a lot of names, it's the same grinder. It's really, really popular right now. A lot of interest, probably the most requested review on this channel. I've had this for a couple of months, I'm gonna share some thoughts. Now, to give you a brief overview of the specs of this grinder, it is a single dose grinder. Obviously it has no hopper, it's got a little kind of bellows set up here. But you put in what you wanna grind, it'll grind it through into this little plastic dosing cup. It has 64 millimeter burrs, hence the name DF64. Those burrs spin at 1400 RPM, and those burrs are made by Italmill. However, these burrs can be switched out for something like the SSP burrs, the high-uniformity or the unimodal. Now price wise, this is what has made this so interesting. Prices vary depending on where you are. In the UK, it's about 400 and something pounds. I've seen it for about 400 euros, I've seen it for five to 600 US dollars. You can buy from local distributors and generally I would advise that. I bought mine in the UK, where it's branded Solo. You can buy it more directly on alibaba.com. I think it's about $450 there. But that's before shipping, before any kind of import or duties that you might pay there. And that'll obviously vary. Obviously buying in-country, you'll pay what you're gonna pay up front and it's simple and it's easy. At that price point, it is considered to be the very strongest competitor to something like the Niche. Right, the Niche Zero has had an incredible couple of years. It has been hugely popular. I have one, I talked about it on the channel before, I really like the grinder. We'll talk about why again, coming up, because I think it's really important to talk about why I liked that grinder and how I feel about this grinder, because it's positioned as the Niche killer. Now, the Niche is a little bit more expensive at about 500 pounds, and they are a little bit more supply constrained. However, the Niche remains in very strong demand and they tend to run pre-sales that sell out, and people are looking for an alternative. And on paper, this is very interesting. It's cheaper, it's a flat burr grinder, which some people really like, as opposed to a conical burr grinder with the Niche. And you can use different burr sets with it. It seems like an obvious alternative, a better choice potentially, but is that the case? So today we'll talk through a few things. We'll start with kind of making coffee with it. What's the coffee it produces like? Does it make a great tasting espresso, great tasting filter? And then we'll talk more about the experiential aspect of it. Flaws or bugs or quirks or things that I like or things that I don't. To start with though, we should use it for its intended purposes, and pull a shot of espresso. So grinding with it. It's not particularly fast and it's not particularly slow for these kinds of grinders that sits somewhere in the middle I guess. It does grind into this, which makes some people angry. It's a little plastic dosing cup. It's actually for me, preferable to grinding directly into a portafilter, for a couple of reasons we'll get into. But some people don't like the plastic. To be honest, I quite like grinding into something clear, it lets me see how it's going when I distribute it into the portafilter. And this does fit inside a 58 mm portafilter, which is good. So let's throw this in. So you can see that you're reasonably well distributed before you might then go on and finish distribution with say a puck rake or something like that or another distribution tool, but you're starting from a reasonably good place. Espresso from this grinder has generally been good, enjoyable, tasty, well extracted. It's a good set of flat burrs from Italmill. I do have some SSP burrs that fit this. I'm not running those in there, 'cause I wanted to review this as stock. Because this sort of, the price of this was the appeal. So starting with a sort of more expensive setup didn't really make sense. The espresso from this grinder, it is good. It's not incredible, but it's good. Sweetness is there, has okay to pretty good clarity, the texture is pretty nice. I've never really had issues with it, it's not a flawed espresso in any particular way. Yes, there might be a little bit more available with better grinders or better burr sets, but I'm not in this particular moment having a bad time. It's a really nice espresso that I'm getting out of this thing. Now, in terms of negatives of the espresso experience, there are a few. Firstly, I'm down getting towards the zero point pretty quickly here. I'm grinding at sort of five on the dial, and it's not recommended really to take it much past zero. You could, but you know, you're getting close to the sort of touch point there. Which is kind of interesting that it's got a small range. And I've not been going super far around, maybe 50 or 55 on the dial here for like a V60 grind. So I know I like to grind finer than V60, but ultimately it's not a huge range on this if that makes sense, of kind of a usable espresso range. Secondly, there are some issues with this. Firstly, mine does not stay in very well. And it will wiggle its way out as this thing grinds, which is just plain irritating. This is kind of designed as if it might be a portafilter fork, and portafilters do fit in there. You might be tempted to do this. Don't, just don't. It certainly, with no portafilter I've found, does it sit well and not wobble out and cause a terrible mess and much frustration and swearing. So into the dosing cup. The other reason that I would recommend dosing into a dosing cup first with a lot of grinders, is that that act of sort of shaking it around and mixing it up before transferring it over, helps with kind of grind distribution and kind of uniformity. What you'll have noticed is that when you do press the bellows, quite a good bit of coffee comes out. And that coffee is held behind a kind of silicon declumping sort of screen. It's quite a rudimentary thing, it's not particularly well set up. And it is to me a bit of a problem. That coffee being stuck there can cause some regrinding, and you might notice that the very last coffee that you push out is a little bit finer than the rest of the coffee, which I think adds to a little muddiness in the cup, a little bit of harshness and is a flaw for me in the grinder. It would mean if I was putting very nice burrs inside this thing, I wouldn't be getting the best out of them. Now I've already seen people, I'll link to it down below, have come up with alternatives to this. They are using clump crushers from the Mythos grinders. Someone's 3D printed a new housing to go inside this. They've been having good results it seems, but as stock, the declumping situation here is not very good. I don't think it's a particularly elegant or even particularly good solution here. And I think it has been a pain point for a number of people online who've bought this grinder and used it. It's not a deal breaker, but it is a frustration. Should we brew some filter coffee? The grinder adjuster is stepless, it's quite nice to use. We're gonna move to about there. Now this is what happens if you don't use a little spritz of water on your beans first. For a coarser grind of light roasted coffee, things tend to get messy. That's err... not ideal. Now the upside you can argue is if you don't like chaff in your coffee, great. 'Cause there's almost no chaff in the coffee, it's entirely on the grinder. Now you might argue I'm being unfair, I did say it needs a spritz of water. It does need a spritz of water. This is what happens if you don't. Let me clean this up and show you how it is with a little spray of water first. So that's much better. That's much better. Yeah, there's a little bit of mess still, but it's kind of, it's workable, but you know, make sure you give it a spray of water. Now, the grounds bin with 30 grams of coffee in it, it doesn't look that full. But any fuller than this, when you use the bellows, you'll start to get kind of blowback where coffee is blown out of this thing again by the bellows and makes more mess. So you know, that's a frustration for me. I might want a deeper one of these if I was grinding more coffee than 30 grams, from a mess perspective anyway. Or I'd be sort of taking this out, putting in my V60 and then trying to bellow out the last bit. Is that the phrase, \"To bellow out?\" Can you verb, can you verb bellow? To press out the last bit into this and then throw that on top again, the last little bit will be a little bit finer 'cause there's some regrinding, 'cause it's stuck behind that declumping screen. But it's not massively finer, it's just a little bit finer generally speaking. Let's brew it up. So now it seems like a good time to talk about retention. You know, it's one of the key aspects of single dose grinding, you want a low retention. And certainly with the bellows, this is a relatively low retention grinder. It does retain a little bit inside the body, but it's not really a deal breaker for me, it's not a huge issue. I think for the money, it's a good single dose grinder from a retention perspective. Now in terms of filter brewing, I've had no issues with stuff like stalling draw downs, indicating a high percentage of fines. Generally brews have brewed as I would have wanted. You know, the beds aren't particularly muddy at the end. It looks like it's producing a pretty good grind profile for filter coffee. And the filter coffee it has historically produced, has been very nice. With a kind of flawed, cheaper grinder, when you drink a cup of coffee, you can obviously detect some flaws in that brew. It might have that combination of under and over, that kind of harsh and bitter but also sour and unpleasant at the same time. When I drink this, it tastes like a good cup of coffee, right. It tastes like a well extracted sweet, nice clarity, all of those things. Now, if I compared it to grinders at two or three or four times the price, yes, it may be outperformed by those in a comparative test. But without the comparison, I don't think you feel like you're missing out on much necessarily. If you were using this just as a filter coffee grinder, your comparison point wouldn't really be the Niche, it would be something like the Wilfa Uniform or the Fellow Ode, which are both a little cheaper than this one here. Now this, I think does outperform both of them. From the perspective of, the retention is not really a problem. If you are spraying your coffee beforehand, it's probably neater and less messy than both of them. The bellows do a better job with retention than the other two grinders do with say, a thwacker or anything else like that. So it does perform better as a filter-only grinder and that's kind of with stock burrs or with SSP burrs. So I would say for the money, you are getting an upgrade to spend another hundred pounds more on this than you would do on say, the Fellow Ode. Does it look as nice? Maybe not. Does it sort of fit into a kitchen as well? Does it have the kind of, the feel and the ergonomics and that kind of stuff? We need to talk about that. Actually, before we wrap up on the ergonomic stuff, let's just talk about getting into the burrs quickly. Take the little bellows off, and just move it coarse all the away. And then this top part comes off, very easy. Here's your fixed burr. It's just a plate here, sits on threading, which is outside of the burr chamber. And threading away from ground coffee is always a win for me. Too many grinders have threading near coffee and it drives me, oh, it makes me very cross. The top burr sits against three springs that hold it against that top plate. Obviously, as you screw this in and out, this is pressed closer, more allowed to come further away from the bottom rotating burr. So changing the burrs, cleaning the burrs is very simple, very easy. I like that part about it. The grind chamber, as you can see, does retain a little bit of coffee. But in terms of access and that kind of stuff, yeah, good. Pretty well thought through from that point of view. So the user experience, it's okay, generally speaking. Like as a kind of overall experience, it's okay. It's not horrific, but honestly, it's not superb either. I find the placement of the power button on this thing bewildering. Why would you put the button that you need to use all the time there? Why not on the side like any other normal grinder would put it? It's a really weird design decision. Speaking of those and yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a little bit of snobbery here, but honestly, the decision to use this kind of slightly scripty late 90s font for the numbers, that don't go with the nice sans serif that they use elsewhere. Really weird, it's just really ugly for no reason. And it's part of the grinder that you look at every day, and I find that a really strange decision, you know. The fact that your usable range for espresso is actually quite small, is a little bit frustrating but it's not the end of the world. Repeatability has been pretty good. And then there's the bellows. They are a little bit hacky, right. Like it feels like this hasn't been designed to clear it's sort of grounds chamber adequately. So you need to find another way to do that, we'll just use some bellows. It doesn't feel particularly premium or fun, it's a bit messy. It just feels cheap in a funny sort of way, right. Like it adds a cheapness to the grinder that its build otherwise doesn't really communicate. Like it's solid, it's weighty. It doesn't feel light or lightweight, but the bellows, I just don't like the experience. This little lid part, it's awkward, it's frustrating, it's not an enjoyable experience. It does seem that the grinder can sometimes struggle to clear the last few beans. It has a little popcorning issue as well. And if you don't have the lid on, you will see some pretty spectacular popcorning going on. But it works and that's the thing, right. Like, let's talk about this in comparison to the Niche, because that's really I think what a lot of people wanna hear. So when I reviewed the Niche a couple of years ago now I guess, I think the phrase that I used was that I was charmed by it, right. Like it was a charming little grinder. It exceeded my expectations for a number of reasons and I just liked using it. And it became the kind of default studio grinder until we put five of the fanciest grinders in the world on the bench. And I got a little taste for the fancy-fancy. Now I still like this, I still use this, I still think it's a great little grinder. I still think it's great value for money and it's a great performer for espresso and it does well at filter as well. If I was thinking about just filter coffee in the cup, performance only, then I might have some more complaints. Because as a conical burr set, I don't truly love that style of filter coffee. I think it makes a very enjoyable, very tasty filter coffee, but I have typically preferred this kinda flat burred profiles. And that's just me. But the experience of this grinder was what made me keep it around. I liked using it every day. It was nice to use, it felt intuitive to use, it was pleasing in the right places, and it was as I said, charming. If I had this, I don't think I'd have that same experience because it isn't charming in the same way. It delivers pretty well in the cup, and I feel like it has the potential to deliver better than it does if they could fix the issue around the sort of silicon declumper that's in this, that I think is a big flaw in this grinder. Now, if you're someone who has the budget for this and enjoys 3D printing things or tweaking things or hacking things, or kind of squeezing performance out of things, this may appeal to you, right. Like there's kind of some wins here, some mods you can do to get a better result. And if that appeals to you, this grinder may appeal to you. But if you don't wanna think about the act of grinding coffee every morning, right. If you just wanna have the process, throw the coffee in the grinder, grind the coffee, get on with brewing, have the grinder to be a kind of invisible reliable part of the process, this doesn't do that. This pokes you for attention, it says, you know, \"Press the bellows a bunch of times, work out all of the mess, work out the static thing.\" If I had this, I would be thinking about upgrading. I would be keeping an eye out for other alternatives that maybe performed a little bit better. Maybe try to buy a secondhand Lagom P-64, or another one of those style of grinders if I could find something, you know, not for crazy money. You know, it would do the job, I would be happy with it, but I would be aware that it was a part of my process that could be optimized. And I feel like upgrading grinders or upgrading espresso machines should be around fixing specific problems that you experience. And I feel like workflow is a problem worth fixing, right. I want to enjoy making my coffee as much as I want to enjoy drinking my coffee. And this is where this falls down for me a little bit. If you are an in-the-cup purist, if all you care about is the quality of coffee in the cup and you're willing to compromise other aspects of your experience, I think this is a great choice. I think it delivers great ground coffee at espresso and filter settings. And for the money, I can't think of anything that really outperforms it as a single dose flat-burred grinder. Right, you can functionally go from espresso right through to filter. It's got the range, it's got enough motor power, it'll do the job. You know, it outperforms the Ode or the Wilfa, I think comfortably in that regards. But experientially, it for me, doesn't outperform the Niche. But that's me, and that's, what's important to me. And as a reviewer, you should understand where my priorities sit. I really like the coffee out of this, I really liked the coffee out of this. But given the choice of which I would take home, I'd probably still take this. Just 'cause I just like using it that little bit more, it doesn't frustrate me in quite the same ways. Now I don't get to keep this grinder. This will be given away to one of my patron supporters. They allow me to have a budget to go and buy these things, just like a regular consumer, review them and give you my honest opinions.", "videoID": "53lTlpjM2sQ"}, {"title": "J\u00e4germeister Cold Brew Coffee", "text": "This is a terrifying day for me and also an exciting one because what we have here is the Jagermeister cold brew coffee version. I'm not gonna lie. I'm kind of looking forward to this a little bit I think I don't know I've never only been a Jagermeister kind of person that may shock you something about this just seems so completely ridiculous But that I have to know and many of you wanted to know as well I got 50 hundred DM saying will I be tasting this will I be reviewing this and Yeah, here we go, you know actually had a different title for this video Which was drinking the Jagermeister Cold brew until it tastes good, but I only have one bottle and better things to do tonight So we're just gonna have a little sip. We're just gonna taste it see what's going on here. I don't know much about Jagermeister Because who knows a lot about Jagermeister apart from Jagermeister? I hope that's the last time I say that word It's a sort of horrible Drinky thing that people like to put with other delicious drinks like Red Bull for no good reason and just feel awful and hey Hey you do you you do you this was never my jam and that's okay. They've made a version With cold brew coffee in it. I Don't know. Why now. The good news is it's a hobo lick earth that we knew already with a rabbika coffee It could be worse and a hint of cacao it is masterfully blended in Germany Masterfully blended - know what I will be the judge of that. Oh, wow, 56 botanicals Seamlessly blended with cold brew coffee shaked awake the natural ingredients and serve as an ice cold shot I am now a little bit nervous. I'm gonna get my shot glass from the freezer and just Knock one back. Now. They do recommend keeping this freezer cold and I would imagine to suppress the flavor, but I've done as they've asked oh Dear that is a treacly losing thing Unsurprisingly for something that is minus 17 degrees Celsius. It doesn't smell of much not a lot of is volatile here. There's a little something slightly boozy, but that's That's about it Oh I Have another one Look because it's good. I just I'm just not at the point of having thoughts yet Cheers I'm kind of Disappointed in a way that I'm struggling to verbalize right now It tastes exactly like I thought it would it tastes like Jagermeister poured into the leftover cold bit of coffee I'm not sure. That's a product that anyone was like, oh my god guys guys guys. I just did this I just poured Jagermeister in my cold coffee, and it was delicious. Let's bottle it and sell it Apparently they did think that I don't what do you get the hint of cacao? You get that kind of like a spicy woody note and then in the middle there, is this kind of coffee nurse that is Frankly, unobtrusive and dominated by everything else but it is there. I thought this was gonna be worse I mean it still tastes like Jagermeister. So it's starting from a very low place. Like I don't I don't like Jagermeister like I'm slowly coalescing thoughts around this which is if you like Jagermeister That's okay. I don't like Jagermeister. But if you like Jagermeister, then I'd probably stick to Jagermeister cuz cuz this is Jagermeister made slightly worse And if you like coffee then just stick to coffee Jagermeister definitely makes coffee tastes worse than regular coffee and frankly if the idea of Jagermeister and coffee already appealed to your degenerate mind then I Suspect you've already done the wake and Shake and just dosed up your cup of coffee first thing in the morning and lived that dream Already and they didn't need to make this product for you. I'm really confused about it it just Maybe it's too cold But it's as cold as they said it should be and I don't think I want it to be warmer and yes, I am going to have a third shot, but I Just don't really get why they made it It's it's really just aniseed aniseed aniseed and then there's a kind of coffee flavor in the backend that's kind of Characterless it's not wildly offensive coffee flavor. It tastes like slightly oxidized cold brew That's really your jam. Cool I thought it would be more disgusting than this which is a weird thing to hope for and it's not that it's not You know bad because it's it's still bad, but I dislike it because it's Jagermeister. I was never gonna like the Jagermeister I don't think it would be good with a redbull. I wouldn't do that I just wouldn't I wouldn't do the Jager Bomb thing with anything. So here's my one lasting Fearful thought at the time of night at the point in the evening when shots of Jagermeister seemed like a good idea I'm not sure I'd recommend in by being caffeine at that point right because when you get to bed And the room is spinning madly around you you want to be able to fall asleep? Consuming large amounts of caffeine really helps you stay awake through that awful experience Which I don't get why would I want to makes coffee with this at that point in the night who is doing that? I don't get it. I don't like it But you might but you probably won't it would definitely take more than a bottle to taste good. I think I'm done Ah, it's just aniseed. It's aniseed and bad coffee.", "videoID": "GMuL2nupRFk"}, {"title": "Coffee Roasting Explained", "text": "Today we're gonna talk about roasting coffee. I'm gonna cover what you, someone who buys drinks and enjoys great coffee, needs or maybe even wants to know, about what is a fascinating process. There's a lot to cover today. We'll start with the basics of how the roasting process impacts taste and then we'll go deeper into some of the chemistry going on inside the coffee bean during the process. We'll cover what roasters are really trying to say when they use 'light', 'medium', and 'dark' on their bags. We'll get into the different kinds of machines that specialty coffee companies use to roast their coffee. And we'll also talk about the processes they go through to keep it tasting great every single day. Before we get into that, we should begin where this whole journey begins with raw coffee. So this is raw coffee. This is the seeds, the dried seeds of the coffee tree. And right now it smells and tastes, well, pretty terrible. It doesn't smell of much at all. It smells kind of like,  well plant seeds a little bit, 'cause that's what it is. All of the flavor happens in that process of transformation inside the roasting machine and it is an astonishing process of transformation. You would never think looking at these, potentially tasting these, that they were capable of so much flavor and so much complexity. But as we're gonna explore today, they absolutely are. Now, it's the roasting process that creates those kind of familiar coffee flavors that we all enjoy. And when we talk about the roasting process, we often simplify it down to three characteristics that change in the process, as we roast the coffee. And the first one is bitterness. The longer we roast the coffee, the darker the color of it will be. And a little bit like caramel, a darker caramel will also taste much more bitter. So there's an increase in bitterness during the roasting process. The second characteristic we often simplify is acidity. Now that actually increases initially, and then has a little bit of a bell curve, and then begins to decrease the darker the roast gets. For this reason, a lot of people prefer darker roasted coffee. It doesn't have the acidity that they don't particularly enjoy. However, it's rare to find dark roasted coffees in the specialty coffee world. And that's because of the third characteristic we need to talk about, which is difficult to talk about, without sounding a little bit pretentious. And that is origin characteristics. Where you grow coffee, be it soil type, climate, altitude, or even how you process it after harvesting, well, all of that will have an impact on the kind of chemistry inside the seed. And when you roast it, well, different coffees will produce different flavors. We'll call this origin characteristic. And initially when you roast a coffee, you do create those flavors. You can only create them based on what's there, but there's a process of creation initially. Then, however, the longer you roast the coffee, the less of those distinct unique characteristics that belong to that particular coffee remain. And you get more and more of what we call a kind of generic roast taste. Put another way, darker roasted coffees ultimately end up tasting much more similar. And because specialty coffee is so interested in unique characteristics, that's why you tend to see lighter roasts that also happen to have more acidity in them. But this is a simplification of the process. Let's go a layer deeper. What we'll do now is we'll just follow along the roasting process, from raw all the way through to a pretty dark roast. So what we're gonna show you is a couple of angles of the roasting machine running and what we'll also do is pull out a sample every minute or so initially for the first five or six minutes, and then every 30 seconds after that, as the roast progresses, so that we can see the color changes happening. Now, initially, not a lot happens. You'll see that the green coffee remains green for a little while. Green coffee has quite a lot of moisture in it and what the roasting machine needs to do first, is essentially dry it out. It's really hard to have those browning reactions take place with moisture present. It kind of limits your temperatures. Once that coffee has gotten dried out, you'll see the color changes from green, it gets kind of paler, and then relatively quickly will begin to yellow. And we're at the very beginnings of those kind of browning flavors. Now, this roasting chemistry, as it progresses, does some really interesting stuff. Firstly, all of that water that hasn't escaped is turning to steam and is building up pressure. And then other roasting chemistry is causing gases to form, gases like CO2. But we'll see a lot more of that later. And you build up pressure inside the coffee bean, and a really key moment in the roasting process is called first crack, because at some point relatively early on, that pressure becomes too much and the gas escapes from the coffee bean causing it to crack open and you can literally see those cracks. But more interestingly, you can hear them, it sounds a little bit like popcorn. But it isn't like popcorn. It doesn't swell in size. It just lets the gas out. As a roaster, you're paying attention to when this happens in your roasting process. And from this point onwards, the browning reactions are really underway and those are so complex and so rapid that this is a point from now on where you are really paying a lot of attention. Those color changes are relatively minor, but the flavor changes happening now are actually surprisingly large. Historically, roasters just looked at the color of the coffee beans. We'll talk about why they don't do that anymore. But ultimately these shifts aren't very visible, but they are big changes in flavor. Big changes in acidity and sweetness and bitterness are happening right now. At this point, you could probably take the coffee out and drink it and enjoy it, depending on your vision as a roaster, on how you like coffee to taste. The coffee may roast a little bit longer. This point, everything is drinkable and good. So as the roast progresses, those beans will begin to get a little bit darker. They'll also get a little less wrinkly and a little bit more even looking. As they get darker, they'll kind of smooth out. But as we continue to progress, well we get towards dark roasts and what'll happen is there'll be another release of gases later on and that's called second crack. Here you you'll see that the beans are really pretty smooth, a much darker brown and the beginnings of oil on the surface of the bean, that's happening because of those pressures inside the bean forcing the the oil to the surface. And the coffee bean itself is much more porous. It's actually swelling and growing in volume, decreasing in density. Now, you can keep roasting and you can keep roasting, you can keep roasting. You'll generate more and more of that bitterness. At this point, acidity is really pretty low. Origin characteristics is really pretty low and bitterness is going up and up and up. You might also see an increase in texture and kind of body and mouth feel when you brew that coffee. But after, in this case, I think 17, 18 minutes of roasting we're gonna call it a day here, However, people do roast darker than this. For me though, this was dark enough to show you what I wanted to show you. So what we've done is we've laid out some of the coffee from each of the samples here on the table, so we can talk about roast levels and really what they mean. Now we'll talk about specialty first, because I would say, the the kind of categorization of light medium dark is a little different between specialty and commercial. Specialty would start, I would say around here, really pretty light and it would run probably to around here. So anything within this, could be classified as a light roast. Medium would run from this point up until maybe here. The minute I see any sort of oil of any kind on the surface, I would say you've crossed into a dark roast. And from here onwards it's a dark roast. It's rare for special to be at this end of dark roasting, but it's not unusual to see coffees roasted this way. Commercial's a little bit different. I would say the light starts about the same, but probably runs a little bit further in. Then medium would start here and run again a little bit further in. And then after that, dark roasted. They'll also roast darker than we have done here. I don't think it tastes great from a specialty perspective, but some people still do enjoy very darkly roasted coffee. At some point, it just turns to carbon and then catches fire. I don't recommend that. But darker roasts are certainly possible, but the color alone does not tell you everything. To understand that a bit more deeply, we need to talk about what's called a roast profile. Now, if you wanted to roast coffee at home, you could certainly get a sheet tray and pour out some raw coffee on it, pop it in an oven at 200 degrees Celsius and it will roast in there, it will go brown. If you look at the roast profile, you'll see that the temperature of the coffee would increase and it would begin to slow, the closer it gets to the target temperature. When you take it out though, that's not going to be the best tasting coffee, for a couple of different reasons. Firstly, where the coffee beans have been touching the metal the whole time, well they'll have had a lot more conduction heat transfer and they're probably gonna be a little bit burnt around those spots. And secondly, you don't necessarily want to have one constant temperature that the coffee is trying to reach. What we've learned through coffee roasting is actually you wanna vary the amount of heat coming into the roaster and change it to change the rate at which the coffee is turning brown. So this brings us to what roasters are talking about when they talk about a coffee roast profile. Now, machines themselves can often be very old. They can be sometimes very new. Regardless, they're all using multiple temperature probes positioned around the roaster to collect data and feed it into some sort of computer software. What that's ultimately gonna track, is the temperature of the bean probe. That's our closest guess to the temperature of the beans themselves during the roast. Now, the journey of the beans in terms of how quickly they get hot, it will change depending on the coffee and what you want it to taste like. It might be that this phase here in the middle is it's heating up if it heats up quicker or if it heats up slower. Well that would change the flavor and through a period of trial and error, and ultimately then knowledge that's passed around within the industry, you learn to create a roast profile for a particular coffee, usually on a particular machine. So it's not something you can take from one person's roaster and apply to another person's roaster, which is kind of confusing. Now here on the screen you can see a few things going on and quite a lot of data, and for most people it's kind of overwhelming. But ultimately, this probe here is the beam temperature probe and you can see the journey that it goes through and you'll see, that generally it's heating up pretty quickly here. It slows and continues to slow and towards the end slows even more. That's not absolutely universal, but it is extremely common. And during the roast, roasters are making small changes to the amount of heat coming out of the burner or in some cases the amount, of air flowing through the drum, to change how much heat is being transferred to the coffee itself. And that's how you create a roast profile. Roasters aren't aiming for one perfect profile, but they are aiming for consistency in their roasts. And I wanna talk just briefly about how they approach that. Now, the first most obvious thing to do is to taste the coffee that you roast. And most roasters will be tasting everything that they roast, but there is a problem. Modern expectations say that the consumer wants their coffee roasted, bagged and shipped the same day, so that it is as fresh as possible. And this means really functional tasting is difficult to do before the coffee goes out the door. So they're looking for other ways, other checks that the the coffee can pass or fail to hit, to make sure that what they bag up and ship is tasting the way that they want it to. There's really three ways and the first way we've kind of touched upon, that's the roast profile. The coffee should have followed the desired lines during the roast in order to pass that at the start. But some roasters will have higher tolerances than others there. And there are still other ways to check if things have gone as planned. Another common thing is what's called roast loss. Now when you roast coffee, it loses weight. You might start with 10 kilos of coffee and anywhere from maybe 13% through to 22%, 23% of it may be lost during the roasting process. Most of that is water, but the darker you roast coffee, the more stuff breaks down and disappears. It doesn't tell you that much. But if you're expecting 14.5% roast loss and you get 15%, that should be a red flag that things haven't gone as expected. And the third one that, again, is very common is color testing. This is using some sort of machine that kind of measures brownness, how light, how dark the coffee is. Most roasters will grind a sample after roasting of every single batch and test the color using one of a variety of meters that do this. The most popular one or the most commonly talked about one is one called Agtron. And sometimes you'll even see companies publishing the Agtron numbers of their coffees to give you some indication of how light or dark that is. I'm not sure that's very useful. It's really a good solid internal measurement. As we talked about with roast profiling, the color alone doesn't tell you all that much, but it's definitely gonna be a problem if that color is too dark or too light. And again, roasters will have some variance, some allowance within that color measurement, a kind of window of tasty. Those are the primary ways in which roasters QC coffee. Now one thing I wanna talk about here is what roasters mean when they talk about a coffee being 'roasted for filter coffee' or having the word 'espresso' on the label, implying that it's roasted in a way that should be brewed as espresso. Espresso is difficult brew method, it doesn't use much water. It's very intense. It's very quick and and what roasters typically try and do is roast the coffee in a way that it's easier to extract. That might be they roasted a touch darker in color. It might be that the whole profile takes a little bit longer. They slow the roast down and there's variations within that. But that's what espresso on the label means. It it's typically a more soluble roast than it would be for a filter coffee, 'cause it's easier to properly brew coffee when you brew it as a filter coffee. You've got a lot more time and you've actually got a lot more water to do the extraction work with. Now, you don't have to brew espresso labeled coffees in an espresso machine. You can brew it in a moka pot, you could make it in a pourover and probably enjoy it still, but that's what roasters are trying to communicate with that language on the label. Let's talk now about how these roasting machines actually work. So first up, I wanna talk about a type of machine called a drum roaster, and it's called that because in the middle of this thing is a big spinning drum. It's like a kind of giant tumble dryer. Now the way that these work is that you have underneath here a heat source, typically it's a gas burner and that's gonna heat two things. By proximity, it's actually gonna heat the big metal drum typically made of cast iron, but primarily it's gonna heat air. Now that air is being pulled through the back of the drum through the coffee and out, and it'll run from here through this fan that's doing all of that work. And it'll be pushed out of the exhaust and away, typically in larger roasters to be burnt, to get rid of any smoke in what's called an afterburner. Drum roasters are interesting. They're probably the most common type of roaster used in specialty coffee companies. And they heat coffee slightly differently. They heat coffee three ways. Primarily it's convection, it's the hot air flowing through the coffee beans. But because the drum is hot, there is some conduction heat, a little bit like a steak in a frying pan. That that touch of the bean onto a hot surface does have some heat transfer. In addition, because that drum is hot, there's also radiant heat kind of emanating from the metal into the coffee. But primarily it's gonna be the convection of the air going through it. It does produce a different kind of flavor, conventional wisdom says, to other kinds of roasters but I don't know how true that really, really is. There's a lot of different ways to use a drum roaster and you can get a lot of very different results from it. Now the roaster operating the machine is gonna be paying a lot of attention to the probe data coming from it to decide when to make changes to the gas going to the burners, but at a very specific endpoint, a combination of time, temperature, and color, the coffee very quickly needs to stop roasting and to be cooled down and pretty much every roaster will use some sort of cooling tray. Now, when the coffee leaves the roasting machine, it's often in excess of 200 degrees Celsius. And I dunno what that is in Fahrenheit, but it's very hot and we need to make it as close to room temperature as possible, as quickly as possible to stop the roasting process. Now, most machines will use air to do that. The coffee will tumble into a tray like this one, arms will stir it, and mix it as a very large fan pulls air from the room down through it, to cool it down very quickly. Now, larger machines or machines with slightly smaller cooling trays, sometimes need to use a different process called quenching. Here, a very, very small amount of water is sprayed onto the coffee beans. That water instantly evaporates because the beans are so hot and the evaporative cooling really very quickly cools the beans down. Now, there's no real downsides to quenching, except that that coffee will need a little bit less rest before cooling and it will stale slightly quicker. But quenching does not impact the quality of the coffee whatsoever. Cooling done. Let's talk about a different sort of roasting machine. There is another type of roasting machine. It's called a hot air roaster, a little bit different to a drum machine. Here you've got a big heat source and that's separate to the machine and it produces one side a blower, vast amounts of hot air that flow into the machine and the hot air is not only gonna roast the coffee, but it's gonna do all of the agitation as well. So when you look inside these, you can see the coffee being thrown around, churned and moved just by the volume of air flowing through it. That means there's no real moving parts in the roaster. The way there are inside a drum roaster. but just the same, you're gonna vary the intensity of the heat, but here you can also vary the volume of air flowing through it. There's no better roaster out there in the world than any other. There's simply a tool for a roaster to create the flavor profile that they like. And for some roasters, they prefer the style of coffee you get from an air roaster, that is a little bit different to drum roasters. And then there's a third type of roaster, a kind of hybrid air roaster. Here, you still have a drum that rotates to tumble the coffee, but like an air roaster the heat source is separate. So it's really just heating the air. The drum itself does not get hot. Some people say these can be much more efficient. Others like the fact that the drum doesn't kind of have any conduction heat into the coffee. Again, roasters are just tools to make the coffee that you wanna make. And that is the basics of coffee roasting. And now I want to hear from you down in the comments below. What aspect of this do you wanna know more about, should we go deeper into in the future? Has this been helpful in how you think about coffee? Has it been eye-opening? Let me know your thoughts. I'd really appreciate it. Now, I will say, some of you are gonna ask a question and that question is, when are you gonna make a bunch of videos about roasting coffee at home? I don't know.", "videoID": "N6BJVM5tvnw"}, {"title": "The Weber EG-1 (Episode #2)", "text": "Welcome to Episode Two of the Ultimate Grinder Showdown Week. Today, we're looking at the EG-1 from Weber Workshops. This is a three and a half thousand dollar grinder and it is a grinder obsessed with detail. Weber Workshops started out back in 2014 as Lyn Weber, Craig Lyn, I think, departed the company in 2018 and it became Weber Workshops. This is their electric grinder, I assume, EG. They do a HG as well, which is a hand grinder but this is the one that I was very interested in. Now a lot has been made over the years over Douglas Weber's history as one of the team that worked on the Apple iPod. His background is in manufacturing and design, and it really shows in this particular grinder. And I think a good introduction to it is just to sort of walk you from top to bottom and highlight some of the details in the build, construction, and sort of the way that this thing works that I think is just stunning. Starting at the top of the grinder, you can see the sort of fan at the top here, keeping the motor cool, moving down you've got a beautiful little bean funnel. This is attached on two locking pins and a magnet. So you don't actually need any tools to detach it. Those magnets are going to become a little bit of a theme for this grinder. Moving down, we have the locking ring here for your grind setting. And this is the only grinder that we're going to look at in this whole week that actually locks it's grind setting. Now that locking does mean it is a stepped grinder. So you can see the little markings here for each step. You lift this, move it, and drop it down into whichever step, finer or coarser, that you want to go. As you'd expect, moving towards smaller numbers takes you finer, then moving towards larger numbers takes you coarser. The steps I think are small enough. Certainly there are times where I wish they were a little tiny bit smaller, but I'm being very fussy there. I've never really had any major issues dialing in an espresso to be just the way that I want them. Moving down, we end up with this little platform here and on this is the Blind Shaker. That is the one accessory that comes with this that I'll talk about a little bit more in a second. Now this platform is on a spring so you can tilt it forward to easily remove it. And that way, when it sat there the shaker sat close to the exit chute to minimize mess or or sort of spray from static. This button here allows you to move it up and down as you wish. It's a very nice little detail. Beyond that you've got a start stop button and you've got a dial here for controlling the RPM of the grinder. And this runs up to about 1800 RPM which is probably higher than you'd want to go. I've generally run this at about 600 RPM most of the time. That isn't where the detail finishes and just looking at it, touching it, you can see the machining tolerances are tiny. Everything fits together beautifully. This is manufactured and assembled in Taiwan and shipped from there at the moment. Coming around the side, small little bean knocker that I think is a nice little detail but it's attached to these outer pieces here. And this is I think just a little piece of magic. This is where the burrs are inside the grinder. So if you want to access the burrs, this pulls out, this comes out and you've actually exposed the burrs. They're sat right here, inside the grinder, very close to each other, cause we're in an espresso setting right now, but that's it. If you want to clean that burr chamber, no tools required whatsoever. That I think is, is beautiful. It's so elegant. It's so nicely done. They fit together so nicely and everything feels just really well-made. And it would need to be because this thing is three and a half thousand dollars that is incredibly expensive for a coffee grinder. So you'd really want to know where your money is going and build, design, is unquestionably a big part of that. Let's put it back together. I mean, that's just ridiculous, isn't it? How simple is that? And then you have your, your one accessory to this which is the Blind Shaker. Essentially inside you've got this piece that acts as a sort of stopper at the bottom of this sort of catch bin. So this drops and you would grind into this thing. This sits on top to hold everything in place. So you can give it a good shake that would get rid of any clumps, help with better sort of distribution of particles. And then you would place this on your portafilter and ultimately pull this out and the coffee would fall through it into the portafilter below. Everything fits together very well, feels very nice, feels very solid and well-made. Now the grinder does not come with a little spray bottle and I prefer to use a little spray bottle with this from a sort of messiness perspective having the blind shaker sit pretty close to the exit chute does reduce mass but if you don't do this, you do get a bit of static. You will see some chaff round and about the grinder and that can be frustrating, a little bit messy. Let's pull a shot. Now, as you watch the RPM counter, as well as listen to the grinder, you can hear that the grinder is trying to achieve the desired RPM. And it's doing that by varying the amount of power being sent to the motor to try and keep it at that RPM. It will drift around a little bit. So if your target is 600 it will sometimes be below, sometimes above; it'll kind of wander around. When you finally clear the coffee from the burr set, it's suddenly easier to spin faster so the RPM will go up and then come back down again. It's not my favorite part of this grinder. I liked that the RPM is controllable, but that's true of most of the grinders we're going to test this week. I don't love the way it executes that. It just doesn't sound as nice as this grinder feels and looks and generally is to use. I don't think it's doing anything bad to the coffee by any stretch. It's just a complaint of mine. Once you've removed your central piece there, you need to give it a little swirl and then it will distribute generally pretty well. So let's talk about the burr set. This grinder comes with their core burr set, which is a little bit like the Lagom P64, a hybrid burr set. You can get a more unimodal set as an additional sort of upgrade or add-on so to speak. But this one is designed for both espresso and brewed coffee, and I think it works well. Profile wise, it's closer to a sort of more unimodal profile, where espresso is sweet and clean and balanced, but not a ton of texture but not absent texture either. I think it's a nice sort of hybrid burr from that perspective, there are other options that are more espresso-focused as well. And if you're using this as nothing but a brewed coffee grinder then I would consider the upgrade to a unimodal burr set, that or a more unimodal burr set anyway. Now you might think that the Blind Shaker is really built for espresso, but I actually really like it for most filter coffee applications. It's a nice way to distribute coffee bang into the centre of a V60, you can get coffee into an aeropress with a little funnel. It works well for most brewing methods. I don't have any issues with that. I don't wish it came with something different for grinding for filter coffee. And its profile for filter coffee we will discuss in more depth in the head-to-head review at the end of the week, where it will be much more comparative tasting between all of these grinders. Now, one thing that I really love about the setup of this grinder is the way that the burrs are mounted on this thing. In most grinders, you'll expect to see two sometimes three screws in the burrs holding them in place. That is not the case with this grinder On this grinder, the burrs are held in place by a combination of pins and magnets, again. That means that the burrs themselves have no unusual holes in them for putting screws through. Now, a lot of people worry about what happens if they chip a little bit of a burr if a stone or something gets into their coffee, right? That's small damage to one of the cutting teeth. Does that ruin your espresso? I don't think it does, but it will have an impact much the same way that in every burr set having three holes that don't have cutting teeth inside them must impact the burr set. With this, it's completely uniform. Every piece of the burr is the same all the way around and I think that's super cool and I think that does help produce excellent results in the cup. So to summarize, let's talk through the things that I like and the things that I don't like as much. What I like unquestionably is the build. It's so well-made, every detail just feels thought through, the materials choice, it looks beautiful. This is a incredibly well-made thing and that brings me pleasure to look at in the morning, to use day-to-day. I think the way that it comes to pieces is incredibly thoughtful as well. I love that you can access the burr chamber with zero tools in less than 10 seconds. I think the detail everywhere, from the spring lever here, the little thwacker at the back there, it's all great detail. I think it makes delicious coffee incredibly enjoyable. It is a big grinder. There's no denying this. It's tall. It won't fit under most countertops, it's relatively wide. It's not that deep, but it is a big, pretty heavy thing. This may not fit in every home but if you've got space in your kitchen and space wherever you make your coffee it would probably look pretty great there. I think it can be a bit messy if you don't use a little spray bottle now and again, and that has been a frustration when I've used lighter roasted coffees that do have a little bit more chaff around them. I wish that the way that it sounded when it's grinding sounded a little bit different. I wish it wasn't hunting out its desired RPM and sort of moving around in that manner. It doesn't reassure me the way that the build of this thing does overall. I don't think it impacts coffee but it does somewhat impact my experience. Then there's the price. It's three and a half thousand dollars before it is shipped to you wherever you are in the world. And I paid about $150 in shipping. That is a staggering amount of money. Whether it's worthwhile is a question you have to ask yourself and it's not the only grinder we'll look at at that kind of a price point, but it is incredibly expensive. But you see where your money is going. And I think that's important. I think that's what you want to see. Every detail here has been considered. Every materials choice has obviously been considered and that's, that's hard not to like. It's a very aesthetic experience. It's very enjoyable. I am impressed. Do I wish it was cheaper? Absolutely. Do I think it's overpriced? No, I do not. It's a small company producing a small number of beautiful things. They're not buying tens of thousands of pieces to bring the costs down. They don't have scale to bring that cost down. And so I am understanding of that high, high price but if you've got the cash, if this appeals to you, then I think you'll have a very enjoyable coffee experience with this grinder. I don't get to keep this particular grinder because this goes to one of my Patreon supporters because my Patreon supporters give me a budget every month to go and buy equipment to review for you. And because I buy it I don't get loaners or freebies from manufacturers. The reviews I hope are unbiased. I'll certainly miss having this grinder around.", "videoID": "3mB4MBITEI"}, {"title": "The Levercraft Ultra (Episode #4)", "text": "Welcome to episode four of the Ultimate Grinder Showdown. Five reviews over five days, and on the sixth day, a big head-to-head of some of the best grinders that money can buy. Today, we're looking at this, it's the LeverCraft Ultra and there's a lot going on here. There's the grinder, there's a box, there's another box. What's this all about? It's an interesting approach, and there's some genuinely new technology inside this thing. Let me give you a little bit of backstory on this grinder and the companies behind it, because there is more than one. Now LeverCraft are based in the U.S. It's founded by a guy called Eric Mann. He started off, I think, kind of repairing vintage lever machines. He has a coffee roasting company in a cafe in Austin. He does not build these grinders. The Ultra is a grinder that is built in China, and is available in China also, direct from the manufacturer. LeverCraft have built a relationship with that manufacturer, where they're having a customised version of that grinder brought into the U.S. This grinder is $2,600, which seems kind of surprising when you can see that the Ultra is available in China for $1,100 but know that that's shipping within China. If you start to export it from China, then you're gonna pay all sorts of shipping and duties and other things like that. There seems like a price discrepancy but I can understand where that money is going in this particular situation. I also don't know, without putting a normal Ultra next to it, what the difference between an Ultra in China is, versus the sort of LeverCraft version. I don't know what's been customized. Inside this are 98mm burrs and this is the first, I think, of the run that has blind burrs. So by that there's no screw holes similar to the EG-1 that we talked about before. Now at 98mm, like the Mahlk\u00f6nig EK43 and the Monolith MAX, that's a very large burr set. Compared to the 80mm burrs of the EG-1 or the 64mm burrs of the P64, 98mm burrs are huge. They're monstrously huge. And so these three grinders are kind of comparable in that particular regard. And this burr set is certainly interesting but we'll grind some coffee and a little bit. There's a few more things to talk about. Namely, what is this big giant box next to the grinder? In fact, what's this little box here? We'll start with a little box because it'll explain the big box. Here on the little box is your controller. This dial adjusts your RPM, and it goes down to zero which isn't particularly useful, but up to 2,500 and ultimately the burrs won't really turn below 150 RPM, certainly without any resistance and if you put coffee in there, you'd need a little bit more torque to get things going. This button starts and stops the grinder and you'll notice it's very quiet and it's obviously louder when you grind coffee but when it's running, you could easily leave this running and not realise. There's some pretty hefty power connections at the back of the grinder connecting it to this controller box. Now, what this grinder is able to do beyond just variable RPM, is RPM profiling where you can program the grinder to run a different RPMs for different periods of times and ramp up or down between different speeds as you desire. This is interesting but also it reminds me of pressure profiling. There was a technology that was an answer in search of a question. And I think at this point we're getting closer to finding uses for pressure profiling because we ultimately understand flow within espresso better than we did before but I don't yet have an obvious use case for RPM profiling. Now, Eric does suggest one which is you could run your grinder at say 500 RPM for 10 seconds and then ramp it up to 2,500 to kind of blast out any coffee that might be remaining in the burr chamber and you could do this manually. If I wanted to, I could start the grinder and twist the dial at the end to ramp it up, or, you know, an automated version of that is kind of nice. Though, I will say, that's not really a problem I've needed solved. It doesn't really retain a ton of coffee in here. So I haven't really wanted to bother setting that up. It just doesn't seem super useful, but I get it's an interesting idea. I can't get away from the fact that this is a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff to put on a counter. This is an expressly domestic piece of equipment. This is not designed to go into cafes. And I'm kind of confused by the idea that I've seen this discussed as kind of a box to go under counter. In my kitchen, the sockets, the power is above counter. And so I'd have to kind of drill a hole in my bench, run power down to my control box, run the two power cables back up from my control box into the back of the grinder. Just to hide this thing. If I've got a big kitchen or if I've got a big espresso making space I could probably accommodate that. I'm sure you could put the box under the grinder if you wanted to. It's sturdy, it's sealed. I wouldn't worry about that but it's a lot of stuff. It's not particularly heavy. The grinder itself is extremely heavy. This thing is an absolute monster in terms of weight. Design-wise, I like the red on that. There's a pretty monochrome feel across the other grinders here. So a little splash of color I think is quite a nice thing. That seems to be custom to LeverCraft from what I've seen of the Ultras made in China and sold in China anyway. And then the rest of the design, I have kind of mixed feelings about. There's a kind of heat sink-y vibe around the motor here. This, to me, has become a place to collect dust that is not particularly easy to clean and so I don't love that aspect of it. If you like the styling and the design, you know, it looks nice. It's well-made, it feels solid. Tolerances seem extremely tight. And they're very pro talking about the very well aligned burr set in this thing too, which is a good thing. Before we make coffee, I just want to go through the accessories because here, I think, LeverCraft have done a fantastic job. First up, I'll go with this. It's the portafilter dosing ring. This one is magnetic, which is just very pleasurable. Now it's designed so that you just click it on, it sits on top. That's great. And you put it under here and everything sits level and this sort of holds everything in place. And that does work really very well. I haven't had any falls. Nothing's gone awry with this. That is a nice little accessory. Second up is the distribution tool. This is a very nice one. This has lots of little needles. It's very easy to use. It's very satisfying to use. It feels very nice. Of all the tools that have been included, this is my favorite. It just pleases me to use. The one extra they had sent me after the grinder had shipped is this bellows, which also is a little dosing funnel. And it's quite clever. It's actually two pieces. There's a compressible rubber bellows here but this sits inside it. And this is very clever because at the bottom it's sealed, but when you press it, it opens. So that means you've put it on top of your grinder, you put your dose in there, you run the grinder, and when you're ready to start grinding, push your hand down it'll drop the beans in and you'll start grinding. And then afterwards you can pump this as a bellows to blow through a little bit of air, to clear out the chamber. That is a very nice, very simple, very clever piece of design. Hats off to LeverCraft for that one, I really like it. What seems slightly at odds with this is the little bean dosing cup that comes with it. That's clearly a 3D print and it's not bad. It just doesn't feel as nice as everything else but it works pretty well as dosing cups go. And initially I think it was designed that you could also use it as a bellows inside there. This is okay. This is very nice. Let's make some coffee. Now, if you've see my recent video on spray bottles you might've seen that this grinder doesn't just benefit from a spray of water onto the beans, it needs it. It really doesn't work very well without it. It's kind of essential in this particular regard. So beans into the little doser and nothing has yet fallen through. Now from a workflow perspective, this grinder was clearly designed to be used for espresso. It doesn't seem to acknowledge the existence of filter coffee, the way that the EG-1 or the P64 does. But this is a portafilter fork. There's no dosing cup for filter coffee. It really feels more espresso-focused. It doesn't mean it doesn't do a great job with filter coffee. It really does and it's easy to adjust to filter coffee settings. I'm brewing V60s up around 10 through 12 most of the time on the grind setting, where I'm brewing espresso down at 3 most of the time. I can run the grinder and when I'm ready to go,  There's a little piece of metal here that you can flick to catch the last few bits and there's nothing else coming out with the bellows, I'm gonna shut it down. So, a little distribution. Out comes our distribution tool just to break up any clumps of which there are almost none, I would say, but it does help just distribute things. So let's talk taste. Shots have been great. Very enjoyable. Again, it's that unimodal style of espresso where you're gonna have clarity, you're gonna have balance, it's gonna be tons of sweetness, all of those good things without necessarily a ton of texture. It does push you towards slightly longer brew ratios. This is an 18.5 grams in to about 42 grams out. And you've got a bit of space to go bigger if you want to, just to really get a bit more clarity but you will, again, deplete your textural experience. It's very tasty. It's very enjoyable. Now talking about taste in this regard is difficult. An isolated experience is harder to talk about, comparative testing is really everything, and that will be in the showdown video coming up after all the reviews where we'll taste them all head-to-head and talk about the kind of espresso that they each make and how it varies from the other to help you decide which one you might aspire to own. Now, in terms of accessing bits and pieces of this, parts of it are quite easy. For kind of cleaning or scraping every last bit out, that little exit point here can easily be removed with magnets. This also comes off as well. It's pretty easy to access there. The burrs are much more difficult to access. It's a little bit of a procedure. There's four bolts here. You have to take them off extremely carefully. It's not something you're gonna do every day by any stretch. It's not easy to access the burr chamber the way it is in some of the other grinders that we've looked at. Not the most complicated but one that would be a little bit stressful the first couple of times that you do it. It's something that you could get wrong and that stresses me out. Whereas opening up the EG-1, you just pull the pieces off and you're there. So a little bit of a con in that regard. And again, the other cons would be just the volume of stuff here, the weight and the volume of grinder that you have here. For that reason, I probably would never have something like this in my kitchen; I live in a city, kitchens are small. Just I can't allocate this much space to a grinder in my home. Here in the studio, yeah, I've got space and that becomes less of an issue. If you've got space, you don't have to worry about that. But at home, a lot of people don't, and that's a bit of a difficult one to really overcome. The design is a bit frustrating because of that mess issue, the accumulation of dust and dirt around the sort of base and the fins here. On the upside, it makes very nice coffee. It's quiet, shockingly quiet, beautifully quiet. The kind of experience from a tools perspective is very nice. The grinder is easy to adjust. It's pretty repeatable. You know, where I've come back to a grind point it has done what I've wanted it to do. We'll do more extensive retention tests and a few other things as part of the showdown video to really get into the minutiae of the details between each of these though. Overall, at $2,600, it's mid-range on price which is a shocking thing to say about an espresso grinder. I feel a little bit like a spoiled child, just fussing and complaining about all these little details and not being grateful for the amazing coffee that they all brew. But that's my job, and I revel in it. So the LeverCraft Ultra, super interesting, some very new tech in there. Some new ideas, potential for exploration, really feels centered around espresso more than anything else. Though it is, as I said, very very capable around filter coffee. $2,600. It's enjoyable but it's big. Now I don't get to keep this unit. I'm giving this away to one of my Patreon backers because Patreon allows me to go and buy these things. To buy all of these things and review them, tell you my honest opinion, and not be beholden to manufacturers, lending me things or giving me freebies or any of that kind of stuff.", "videoID": "CbHkdAv0XWA"}, {"title": "In-Car Coffee Makers\uff1a 1979 vs 2020", "text": "I don't know about you but I could do with the coffee. Now in the era of beautiful cars like this, if you stopped by the side of the road and needed a coffee, it was not a choice. Maybe you are one of those terrible people bringing a thermos of Nest Cafe from home, but we don't roll that way, we do it properly. Today, I'm gonna be using this. It's the 12 volt in-car coffee maker from Kingavon. And I'm mildly terrified of it. Let's see what we get. No, I'm not gonna lie, when I opened the box, I had higher hopes. This appears to basically be a kettle with a cup on top, so you've got like your base piece which has an element inside this plugs into your cigarette lighter which of course you have a need in your car. And then you've got your cup which you're gonna drink out of very sensible. And then you've got a couple of other things that are kind of weird, a little tiny cup. I already understand that, and this. Now this piece is interesting, this is a little filter. It could be for tea, it could be for something else. Now I'm gonna use this to make a coffee kind of cowboy style, where I boil the water, once it's boiled throw the coffee in, steep it for awhile, strain it through this at the end, and hopefully get something good. Now I filled this up with fresh delicious water that I did bring in my thermos instead of filthy coffee, and I'll plug it in. It's gonna take a little while, and now we wait. Now, if I had the door closed, I've got a little hook here I could hang it on my inside window while it boils which makes it closer to my face, which seems undesirable. But it's a thing you could do if you want it to do I guess. It's gonna take a long time, so I might as well grind some coffee. Now that isn't at a rolling boil but we've waited long enough. I'm just gonna unplug it and I can bring it out here. Now this was incredibly slow. If we were waiting for this to reach a rolling boil, the sun would have set and it's only 2.00 in the afternoon. Coffee in, lovely. Let's give this a little swirl to mix it all up and we'll let it steep. Now on the box, it looks like this is what people are doing. There's a kind of weird muddy looking coffee on the side of the box, but the box is a bit faded so I don't really know. We'll let this steep for a couple of minutes, we'll swirl again, knock the coffee to the bottom, strain and have a taste. All right, here we go, knocked you to the bottom. Let's give you a gentle strain. I don't need a lot, I don't need a lot of this, let's not put you down inside the car. Not a tremendous job of filtering, if I'm honest, this was maybe a little foolhardy on my part. Wish me luck, does it taste of 1979. It's okay, it's okay. I have to say the experience though, totally sucks. This thing was so slow, I'm terrified of running my battery down on my car. I would've been waiting probably 40 minutes to get that thing to boil, terrible. Actually, do you know what? If I'm honest, it's terrible, it's more offensive than my mustache. It is not good, I don't know why I said it was okay. It's bad, but I do wonder between 1979 and let's say 2020, how have the in-car coffee makers of the world evolved? Now a short ad from this video's sponsor, Harry's. Maybe you look in the mirror and think, it could be time to update my style a little. Well, Harry sent me a trial kit containing a stunning razor with a weighted handle and rubberized grip along with some of their foaming shave gel and a super useful travel cover to keep things in optimum condition wherever you go.

Welcome to the in-car coffee maker of tomorrow. So we're gonna talk about this today. This is the modern alternative. This is your 12 volt in-car coffee maker, and and it looks kind of cute. It comes with a little mug, which is nice. And then also is sort of a pour over, so you've got a little spout at the top here and then your brew basket. Now the capacity of this is a bit smaller. It is 170 Watts, so that at least in this case I know how much power it's gonna draw which is at a decent amperage actually, that's kind of interesting and it'll only do 150 mils of water. So I guess that's nine grams of coffee. Well, from a trusted little hand grinder. So let's dose this into our little brew basket which is very sweet to be honest. And then there's a max and min fill here. Appreciate you may not have a small glass carafe when you're traveling, but you know, let's bang on the Maxville line which is good. Let's plug it in and switch it on. We've got a brew, which is interesting. The bed doesn't look in great condition if I'm honest, it looks like where it's dripped water in, it's just dug a massive hole, so not the most even brew, but how does it taste? Pretty drinkable, like that's okay. It's not perfect, but it's not bad. I got to say, I'm a little bit impressed I feel like in-car coffee makers have come a long way. We've gone from these big lumbering V8 through to self-driving electric cars. And while in-car coffee making, maybe hasn't come quite as far as cars have come, it's come a long way. This is okay, 150 mils is laughably small. Like it's a tiny, ridiculously small portion of coffee, you'd wanna brew this twice. You know, it's a kind of continuous drawer of power here so I can't see why it couldn't be bigger, someone will probably tell me in the comments below and I'll be grateful to them for that.", "videoID": "8V1DOHUiWcU"}, {"title": "The Ultimate V60 Technique", "text": "Today we're gonna be talking about how to brew with the Hario V60. How to get the best results you can through a simple, repeatable technique that will give you a delicious cup of coffee. Now I have designed this technique to work in a cafe as well as at home. To work whether you have a beautiful pouring kettle or whether you just have a regular kettle. It shouldn't matter. And even if you have your own preferred technique and way of brewing, I think there's gonna be something in this video that you'll find useful to just elevate what you're doing a little bit more. So this video is focused just on the V60 for a couple of reasons. It's quite a different brewer to other brewers out there. It is a pure kind of cone shape, unlike say a flat bottom brewer or the Melitta style brewers and the brewer itself provides really no resistance whatsoever. Other brewers typically have three sort of small holes that will slow the water as it drains out of the cone. So the Hario has a large open area at the bottom of the cone, which means it provides no resistance. For those reasons, I wanted to make a video just focused on this, because techniques that work here may not perfectly apply to the other brewers. So before we jump into the technique, I wanna run through the list of kit that I would recommend you have on hand before you start brewing. And first and most obviously, you need a V60. I like the plastic ones. They're the cheapest, they're really hard to break and they do a great job from a sort of heat retention perspective. Most of the time, I actually use this which is the Hario drip decanter, which is a nice glass body and a plastic insert so it's all of the best bits. These are actually pretty cheap now, and I recommend them quite highly. When it comes to filter papers I have made a video previously that are linked down below covering the differences between the sort of Hario filter papers out there. I'd recommend giving that a quick watch after this one and you're gonna need a digital scale. Now this thing is gonna make your life 100 times easier. It's gonna make brews more reputable. It's gonna take all the guesswork out of it. You want something accurate to .1 of a gram, ideally some sort of spoon, teaspoon, soup spoon, dessert spoon, I don't really care, just some sort of spoon and you're gonna need a kettle of some sort. Now my preference is that you pour the water into the V60 from the kettle that you boil it in. Which means something like this, which is an electric pouring kettle is kind of the best possible outcome. This, a regular electric kettle is absolutely fine. It's perfectly good. You can pour from this with no real issues. These things, just straight pouring kettles, they're okay if you're gonna heat the water in it, but if you're decanting from a kettle into one of these, you're gonna lose some temperature and that is gonna affect your brew and then you need coffee beans. Great technique, it's just gonna give you transparency on your ingredients. The best technique in the world, beautifully executed but with low quality coffee will just give you a perfectly terrible cup of coffee. Now the other ingredient is of course water and it's a hugely important ingredient It's gonna make up 98% plus of your cup of coffee and it's gonna have a huge impact on the extraction itself. Now what you want basically is good tasting, relatively soft water. In some cases, you can fix it with something like a Brita filter, if your water, it's a little bit hard. In other cases, it might be worth buying bottled water as much as I dislike that idea. It is possible to make your own recipe water with the right combination of minerals in there. I will leave some links in the description down below on water if you want to dig in a little bit deeper. Now while this will work with pre ground coffee, I would absolutely recommend you buy a Burr Grinder. On the cheaper end there are things like hand grinders if you're willing to do a little bit of work but these days electric Burr Grinders are pretty approachably priced, they are a fantastic investment in how you start your day and will give you that extra layer of control to get the best out of the coffee that you buy. So let's get into the technique. Now here I'm gonna recommend a ratio of 60 grams per liter or per kilo of water. That's kinda of the point of preference. If you wanna use 65, 70 or if you wanna use 55, that's entirely up to you. It's not right or wrong. I just think it gives you a nice resulting strength in your cup of coffee. In the example today I'm gonna be brewing 30 grams to 500 grams, which is enough coffee for two people. I think it's a nice amount to share. Now in terms of grind, I would recommend something that's on the slightly finer end of kind of medium. Now, it's really hard to communicate grand size in a video. I can show you some examples of the ideal grand size for a 30 to 500 ratio, next to say some espresso grounds or next to something for scale but we'll talk at the end about sort of tuning your grind to taste. So you wanna weigh your beans right before you brew and grind them fresh and at the same time you also wanna rinse out your filter paper. That will help remove any potential papery tastes and it will also preheat the brewer. If you have a plastic V60, then you can probably do that with a really hot tap water, but if you have a glass or ceramic or even metal V60 I would recommend doing that with the hottest water possible. Add your grounds carefully to the center of the V60 and then once you've done that, create a little well in the middle of the grounds. This is gonna be really helpful in the next phase, which is the bloom phase, to make sure that we're evenly saturating all of the grounds. You wanna make sure you're using your water as hot as possible. Certainly with lighter roasts. If you're using a pretty dark roasted coffee, it's okay to wait 15, 20, 25 seconds after the water is boiled before starting to pour but if you're brewing something very light, the hotter the better. So make sure your scale is zeroed, start your timer and immediately start to pour and we're gonna gently pour two grams of water per gram of coffee. So here about 60 grams of water and we wanna make sure that we're trying to get all of the coffee wet in that initial phase. If you've got a large pocket of still dry coffee, you can use more water but I really wouldn't use more than three to one in the bloom phase. As soon as you've added your water put the kettle down and grab your brewer and begin to swirl in a circular motion. Now what we're trying to do here is make sure that all of the water and coffee are nice and evenly mixed together. Some people like to do this with a spoon and to stir it together, but in testing, swirling tasted much better, and you're gonna keep an eye on the sort of slurry as you swirl, until you see it look nice and evenly mixed. If it looks lumpy, keep swirling. We're gonna let it rest and bloom for up to 45 seconds. If you're in a cafe, you may only wanna wait 30 as the returns do diminish a little bit beyond that, and I certainly wouldn't wait longer than 45 seconds. The theory is that we're allowing CO2 out of the grounds, making those grounds easier to extract in the remaining phase of our brew. And then we're gonna pour the rest of our water in in kind of two phases. Even though it's gonna be one pretty continuous pour. Here's what we're trying to do. We're trying to get 60% of our total liquid in, in the next 30 seconds. So we're gonna aim to have 300 grams in total poured into the V60 by one minute and 15 seconds. This phase is actually really critical. Now when you pour water into a V60 you disrupt that coffee bed, right? You churn it up a little bit. And it seems to me that in testing, there's a kinda of ideal amount of churn. In situations where you don't disturb the bed at all they've produced very slow brews that didn't taste that good and will encourage you to grind coarser, which will mean you extract less. Pour too aggressively and you create channels and pockets through which water seems to run very quickly, essentially, under extracting the coffee and making it taste bad. Here, we do just a little bit of agitation, but not so much that we have an uneven extraction. Now this means that with a smaller V60, if we're brewing just a one cup and say 15 to 250, you actually want a gentler pour because there's a smaller bed, which is why aiming for 60% gives you a kind of matching flow rate for the dose that you're using. So once you've hit 60% of your total brew weight, you'll see your cone is pretty full and that's a good thing. We want the cone to be full for most of the brew to maintain that thermal mass, keeping the temperature high is actually really, really important. What we're gonna do now is pour a little slower and keep that cone topped up. We're gonna aim to have a 100% of our brew weight in in the next 30 seconds. During this phase we're gonna pour gently. We're gonna pour slowly. If you're pouring with a kettle without a pouring spout, it's okay to pulse a little bit. Just try not to pour too aggressively because you will disrupt the coffee bed unnecessarily at this point. Once you get to your total brew weight, pop the kettle down and grab a spoon and give the V60 a little stir in one direction and then a little stir in the other direction. What we're doing here is trying to knock off any grounds stuck to the sidewalls of the paper and not create a sort of swirling motion that lasts 'cause that'll create a dome in our ground coffee which we don't want. Allow the V60 to drain just a little bit more until it feels safe to do so and give it one final swirl and that's really gonna help keep the bed flat. At the bottom at the end of the brew and give you the most even possible extraction. But now we're into the draw down and the draw down is a really interesting phase of this brew. Lots of different factors will affect your draw down and they're not always what you would think. One of the most surprising for me was temperature. In brewing identical brews, side by side with 95 Celsius and 85 Celsius water, the draw down in the cooler brew took 30 seconds more. Not only did this taste worse, it was a waste of time. So that's why I'm not a huge fan of taking water from a hot water source and putting it into a cold pouring kettle. I think often about cafes, I see doing this. This is just a waste of the baristas time and the customers time. If we brew hotter, we brew faster. As I mentioned before, the paper that you use will have an impact on your draw down time. My preference is always for the faster papers. It doesn't have a massive impact on extraction if your paper slows your draw down a little bit. Most of the brewing is done at this point already. It doesn't taste quite as good as a faster paper to me, but your results may vary. So one more quick thing. Most of V60 videos will tell you not to pour directly onto the paper. You've always got to pour into the coffee or into that kind of slurry. They'll tell you this, because they say that if you pour on the paper, the water goes through the paper, misses the coffee and you dilute your coffee and it'll make it taste bad. This is not true. In my testing, I poured solely on the paper. I aimed to miss the coffee for the entire brew and what happened is that the water just ran down the side of the paper, and in doing so it didn't disturb the coffee bed at all. In fact, it resulted in the single longest draw down of any brew that I had and as a result, a slightly higher extraction than the other brews, but it tasted really bad. Now, the end when the cone has fully drained out what you wanna see is a nice flat bed of coffee. There will always be some fine pieces of coffee stuck to the edges of the walls. They will not come off but there should be no large pieces of coffee left. It should've all fallen into the middle. Throw that paper away, drink your coffee, and enjoy it. And I would recommend for the most part, changing your extraction solely through changing your grind. If you find that coffee to be empty, hollow, a little acidic and unpleasant, go a little finer. In fact, most of the time keep pushing finer until you hit this sudden wall of bitterness, harshness and astringency. At that point, you've gone too far and you do want to come back a little bit coarser but when you come back that little bit, you are kinda of at the maximum extraction for your grounder, for your setup, for your coffee, and it should taste really, really great. This is my ultimate technique.", "videoID": "AI4ynXzkSQo"}, {"title": "Drinking Harrods Coffee From the 1930s", "text": "Today we have some very, very old coffee. Someone watching these videos very kindly got in touch and said they were going through an old relative's sort of stuff, and they found this. And they thought it came from 1908, and they had a good reason to think so. They saw Harrods, Harrods, big department store in London, and they knew that their relative had been an Olympian who was not English. He had traveled to London for the 1908 Olympics, and so they thought it was likely they'd picked up this Harrods-branded coffee then. There were some problems with this, though. There were some confusing aspects of this package of coffee, and let's just drink it in for a minute. Is this not a beautiful thing? And I'll say now we will be desecrating this a little bit later on today. We have to open it. We have to know what's inside. Looking at this was a bit confusing, the idea that this came from Harrods in 1908, predominantly because almost all of the text on this is in Spanish. Now that's confusing. If you look at the front here, obviously you've got caf\u00e9. It's extra superior. You've got verde there, green. Mm, interesting. We'll come back to that in a second. Up here, you've got a little guarantee of Harrods' quality, and then you can see it's from Peru. It's a single origin. That's good news. Down the bottom, there's some other stuff that's kind of confusing. On the back, more Spanish, right? Like it's Departamento de Comestibles, the department of consumables, I guess. That is not a thing that Harrods has in London. So what's going on here? Now, what we did do was email the archivist for Harrods. Turns out Harrods has an archivist, and they're very helpful, so thank you to them. And they said this came from Buenos Aires. Confused? So was I. Turns out in 1913, Harrods decided to open a branch of their department store in Buenos Aires. It's still there. It takes up a whole city block now. It's not run by Harrods anymore, but the sort of brand went on there for a long time. And this seems to be kind of branded product, but at this point, a separate business because the archivist said this logo dates to the mid-1930s. Now, on the one hand, I was very satisfied to have an answer. On the other hand, I was a little bit disappointed that it wasn't 100 years old or older 'cause you know I love some old coffee here on this channel. But it's still very old. It's still 90-ish years old, which is old. Coming back to the front, down at the bottom here is the single most confusing thing going on here. This says a quarter of a kilo net, but this does not weigh a quarter of a kilo. This is heavy. This is solid. Now, my first thought is, one, it's green coffee. This is raw coffee, maybe. It says green on the front. Maybe this is raw coffee. You know, it wasn't unusual way back in the day for people to roast their own coffee and want to get the best and roast it fresh. And that's not a new idea. So maybe it's green coffee, but why is it so heavy? In fact, how heavy is it? This weighs 1,200 and about 12 grams, which is a lot more than the 250 grams net it suggests. I have no idea what's going on here. It feels weird, right? Like you've got this very nice kind of wax paper outer. There's another inner layer there that stops you really feeling what's going on, but it feels like it could be greens, maybe. I've been confused before with very old coffee. So who knows, maybe it's just nearly a kilo of mold. We'll find out, and to do so, we've gotta do that thing where we we cut into this very old package and look at what's inside. I don't how to do this in the least damaging way. There's a bit of the wax paper sort of loose here. I don't know what to do. I don't know. I don't wanna just tear it open like a child at Christmas, but I also want to open it. I could just try and snip the back maybe. Look at you. Look at you. Now, obviously it's not green anymore. If you look at normal green coffee, it has that lovely greenish hue to it. This looks like aged coffee, and if you ever drink aged coffee, and you roast them yourself, you'll know that they can often go quite pale and quite yellow. This is the oldest raw coffee I've ever seen. The grading has not been fantastic on there. There's some black beans. There's kind of broken beans in here, stuff that you really don't wanna be drinking. We're going to need to roast this. And I am gonna screen it, take out all the defects that I can see because I wanna give it the best chance to to be drunk and enjoyed, if that's possible. We will need to roast this, obviously, and I'll get hold of a roaster of some sort. I just find something charming in that smell. I don't think it's gonna make good coffee. Now, under sort of modern definitions, this is not specialty coffee. You're allowed up to five defects of various kinds per 300 grams. So, you know, it's not specialty grade under the modern definition, but maybe it's good. Maybe it was. Maybe we'll find out. Let's go and roast some coffee. I'm back, and I brought an IKAWA Pro. Now, this is a sample roaster. It roasts up to 50 grams at a time. It's very cool. It runs on an iPad. It does good stuff. We use them at Square Mile. They're really useful. We're not gonna talk about this thing today 'cause it's not what the video's about. But I ran a couple of different profiles because, honestly, there's no one out there who really knows how to roast coffee this old. So one has to speculate, and speculate we did, and I ran a couple of different roasts. Both are sort of in the medium range. I figured going super light on this wasn't gonna bring me much delight. So I went a little bit more developed. Let's drink it. Now, I thought a little bit about how to brew this, what's the right way to do it. I think I should grind it by hand. I should crush it manually with my physical strength. I don't know why. I just feels like it's more appropriate, you know, to the age, to the time. So I've got a little hand grounder. We're gonna brew a cloth-filtered V60. I don't know. Again, I definitely want filtration in this. I don't want like a French press or a cupping bowl. I want some kind of cleaning up from the filter. So cloth just seemed kind of nice. Let's brew like a 15 to 250. Wish me luck. Now, this was roasted about an hour ago. Some of you watching are gonna be stressing out that I'm drinking this coffee too fresh. I hope you think about that for just a second in the context of what we're drinking here. It smells joyful because as a kid, I used to love like the hand-cranked pencil sharpener. That was like a special treat to use at school, and this smells like that. Oh my, it's like peanuts and pencil shavings. Yeah, that's basically it. Okay, let's brew it up. I have had old raw coffee before. I drank something that was harvested in the early 1950s and was roasted fresh in Cafe L'ambre in the Ginza District of Tokyo. And that really freaked me out at the time. Like, that just tasted like it had sort of fermented and molded for like 50, 60 years. This smells different. I'm definitely cautious. I'm nervous of this. Whew. I don't need a big cup. I will say I was very excited the day that this package arrived. The idea of tasting this was really exciting. It's interesting how that has changed as this has gotten closer to my face, but it is time, cheers. No, goodness me. That's really not what I expected. Okay, let me go back in, I think. So that is staggeringly bitter. That's not like a super dark roast, and the bitterness is not a roast bitterness. It is like a bitter compound bitterness like a tonic water bitterness, yeah, like a bitter compound bitterness. I don't know how else to describe it because there's not a big roasty flavor to it. It's just this initial punch of bitter. And then, wood, a lot of wood, different kinds of wood, pine wood, pencil wood. What wood do they make pencils out of? I don't know, but whatever wood that is, that wood. It's rich and woody, a little fruit, like a little citrus berry-ness somewhere, somewhere, but you're really searching pretty hard for that. And the bitterness up front kind of freaks me out, if I'm honest. I don't know if I've had anything like that. Genuinely unsettled by that, you know what I mean? Like there's a bit where I'm like, no, this is food safe. It's been roasted, and this is making me go, ooh, is this safe? Are you being an idiot? Now, I know what you're thinking 'cause I know the way you think. You're thinking, \"He said he did two roasts, and one was more developed, and he's only brewed filter coffee.\" What have I done? This, we had to grind this really, really, really fine, like way finer than anything, and it still poured a little fast, like early 20s. Yeah, that's bad. I mean, it is everything we had in the filter brew but more powerful, more potent. Okay, espresso from four score and 10 ago. So definitely should have brought some water for rinsing. That was a mistake. That's a lot. That's a lot. That is, oh no, it's still coming. Wow, okay. Gathering my thoughts, I'm gonna go in for another sip 'cause my brain just couldn't cope with the shining pain, the searing pain of liquid wood. It's more than the pencil of the brew. It's like mega pencil. It's like I just pulled shots of pencil shavings. It's got a little of that rotten goodness in there, too. So, there it is, coffee from the 1930s, Harrods' finest, as it was, from Peru. Fascinating to see. Just to nerd out for a minute, to see the bean prep from what would've been expensive coffee back then be kind of disastrous by modern standards was interesting. And this comes from a time before there was like descriptive language for coffee. It would've just been like fine or not fine. And this would've been fine coffee, but it's not now. It's not now. Anyway, I'm gonna stop there, I think. Actually, one more thing, one more thing. A lot of you been asking about these prints that have been in the background. Let me tell you about these prints 'cause we are very, very excited about them. One second. So we worked with botanical artist Lucy Smith and Dr. Aaron Davis of Kew Gardens to create sort of six botanical drawings of the kind of cultivated species of coffee. So you've got Coffea arabica, your friend and mine, Coffea canephora, liberica, still popular, still grown in many parts of the world, the hot new favorite, eugenioides, that no one really knows how to pronounce. Stenophylla, we've made a video about this species on the channel, super interesting. And one more species that some of you may have come across, which is racemosa, so, so interesting. Tiny little beans, really cool little species. So all of these are grown commercially somewhere in the world at some point. And so we figured it would be fun to kind of make a collection of botanical drawings. We also have all six on one kind of print. Let me get that. It's quite big, but it has to be. There's a lot of detail here because every species has annotations explaining what kind of defines it as a species. On the A4 and A3 size print, these are actually life size. This is how big the cherry is. It's a one-to-one scale on this stuff. You've still got all the detail here about it, and it's just a beautiful drawing. You've got fruit. You've got flowers. You've got like leaf structure. We went nerdy on this one because they're just so cool. We're super proud of them. We think Lucy has done an amazing job with them and Aaron as well, and we really hope you enjoy them.", "videoID": "mZrgzQvNhXg"}, {"title": "I Did Caffeine Analysis\uff1a Some Unexpected Results!", "text": "Today we're gonna bust some caffeine myths. Now recently a company called Lighttells made a relatively inexpensive caffeine analyzer and so immediately I had to buy it. It's in here. Now I say relatively because it was still around $2,500, but that's cheaper than anything else I've seen. Now the reason I was so interested to get it is because there's been loads of studies on caffeine, but honestly, most of the time I haven't really trusted either the quality of coffee they were brewing or the quality of brewing that they were measuring. And suddenly I could do a bunch of tests and ask a bunch of questions and get a bunch of real answers that are relevant to me and the coffee that I drink and the coffee that you drink at home or in cafes every day. First of all, I'll show you how this machine works 'cause it is kind of interesting and then we'll get into the really fascinating stuff. We're gonna cover things from instant coffee to espresso brewing to roast levels and there are some surprises in this whole thing. This is it. I know it doesn't look like $2,500, it doesn't look very exciting, but I promise you it is. The way it works is kind of annoying, if we're honest. Turn it on. That bit's fine and I'll connect to it with my phone in a second. But we need to talk about how you actually do a single caffeine test. And there, there's some bad news. Each test requires this pack of reagent and stuff. There's a chip, there's some pipettes, and there's some reagent in there. Let me show you. There's a little chip. The chip is what you insert into the machine. All of this is single usage. You can't reuse a chip, you can't reuse a reagent. And so each test, each single test, requires this kit and this kit costs \u00a37.50 per test which is wasteful and expensive. So I had to make sure to make every test count which we did. So these two are connected and I can begin my test. I'm gonna need to get a sample of coffee. I happen to have some coffee just here. These are kind of cool. These are pipettes that allow you to capture a very fixed, consistent amount of liquid. That full straw section is what you'll always get. And so we've got a full little tube of coffee there. That gets mixed with this here reagent. In it goes, give it a shake for 10 seconds and then we just need to cover the reading area of the chip with coffee. I can hit start and the analysis can begin. And we've got a result. We're gonna talk about caffeine levels in a couple of different ways. We'll talk about the total amount of caffeine in a drink and we'll also talk about the caffeine level per 100 milliliters or deciliter. That's kind of how the little machine works. Bear in mind that the daily recommended allowance of caffeine for most people is up to 300 milligrams. I did make a whole video about caffeine. I'll link it in the description down below but let's move on with that first test. So the first test we wanted to do was filter coffee versus espresso. Was there a difference in how much caffeine you get based on how you make your coffee? If you took 18 grams of coffee and you brewed it as an espresso, to say 36 grams of liquid, but you extracted a fixed amount of coffee that way, let's say 21% of the ground coffee was extracted into the beverage, and then you made a filter coffee with 18 grams of coffee, same coffee again. But here you used 300 mls of water to extract 21%, let's say. If you compared those two identical extractions was there a difference in caffeine? Turns out, oh wow, there really, really is. The average espresso in testing, the whole espresso if you drank that whole double, had 110 milligrams of caffeine. If you drank that whole filter coffee, again, from exactly the same amount of ground coffee at the start, but if you drank that whole beverage, 170 milligrams of caffeine. That is nearly 50% more caffeine in the filtered coffee than the espresso. This absolutely blew my mind. This was astonishing to me because the extraction was the same! I could imagine a little difference but a difference this big, I could not get my head around. This needed further testing to try and understand what exactly was going on here. This led us to the second group of experiments. Here what we wanted to do was track what was happening with both coffee extraction and caffeine extraction during the course of the brew for both filter coffee and for espresso. Now the way you do this is relatively simple. You would make a coffee as normal. Let's say you make a pour over, but underneath it, you're gonna catch that resulting liquid in five different bowls. So you catch, say, 50 mls in the first bowl, 50 mls in the second bowl, 50 mls in the third, and so on and so on. And so you can slice out the brew into five parts and you can do exactly the same thing with espresso. So you catch the first, let's say, 10 mls in one cup, the next 10 mls in another, the next 10 mls in another. And you can split it out. Now you have to know how much your bowls weigh and you can calculate then the mass of liquid exactly inside. You can then measure the concentration of both solubles and caffeine and you can build a cumulative chart, what's happening over time, which is what I'm gonna show you now. And we'll start with filter coffee because I think that's a nice place to start here. And so the first chart that I'm gonna show you, along the horizontal x-axis, it has mass and along the vertical y-axis, you would see extraction. Now what you're seeing here is at the start, the extraction increases very rapidly. And if you look at the color of the liquid coming out of the bottom of your filter cone, it is much darker. There's lots more solubles coming out at that point. And you'll see as we progress the brew and more water passes through the coffee, that rate of extraction starts to slow down and kind of flatten out. You know the coffee coming through the cone right at the end looks much, much, much paler. Let's look at exactly the same chart, but instead of total solubles, let's just look at caffeine. And again, mass along the x-axis, total caffeine on the vertical Y. And it looks very similar. At the start it extracts really pretty quickly. And again, as we start to run out of caffeine in the ground coffee, that rate slows. And so what you can then do if you want to, it's a bit nerdy I know, is you can then chart solubles extraction against caffeine extraction. And here you'll see that there's a pretty linear relationship. The more coffee you extract from the grounds, the more caffeine you get with it. Pretty simple. But let's look at espresso because that I think is where we see some changes. So here again, same first chart. Along the bottom we've got mass, along the y-axis we've got total extraction. And again, espresso extracts very quickly at the start. That first liquid out is dense and gooey and delicious and it gets thinner and kind of waterier as you go, so the same thing happens. But if you look at the caffeine versus mass chart here, you'll see that it kind of starts to look a little different. The caffeine seems to lag a little bit behind the total extraction. And so when you chart out caffeine extraction and coffee extraction, you see quite clearly there's a big lag in caffeine extraction in the early phases and then it picks up speed. - Hi there! I just wanted to interrupt because I forgot to say this in the video. If you pull more like a lungo, like a 3 to 1 ratio, a longer espresso, do expect more caffeine for the same overall extraction. You'll see that from this chart, again, caffeine is accelerating towards the end, and so longer espressos do have more caffeine. Not as much a pour over, but definitively more. Okay, thanks, bye - Now this particular shot was with a Niche grinder. I'll show you a different chart now. This one from the OPTION-O, the P100, so are a bigger burr grinder, and here this caffeine lag is way more obvious which I think is really, really interesting, though that grinder extracts very, very quickly right at the start too. So it feels like some aspect of caffeine extraction is linked to contact time. That's the only thing I could think of with the kind of variable between these two things. Is it that just espresso happens so quickly that there's not enough contact time to get the caffeine out, even though there is enough contact time to get all those good delicious soluble materials out? That led to the next experiment. For this one, we required the use of the trusty Aeropress and the experiment here was gonna be pretty simple. We were gonna take a traditional Aeropress recipe, 12 grams to 200 grams of water. And what we were gonna change, for a fixed grind setting, was just the contact time. The kind of steep time initially before the swirl, the settle, and the press. And we did a bunch of different tests here going from a 30-second steep to a 20-minute steep. Broadly what you'd expect to see happen with extraction, happened. The longer your contact time went on, the more you extracted. This is news I feel to almost nobody. We know that the longer something steeps in water, the more stuff comes out of it. However, the caffeine extraction rate very quickly started to flat line. In fact, once you'd brewed and steeped for two minutes in that particular phase, you didn't see any additional caffeine extraction really happening regardless of how long you steeped for. And so you don't have to worry that having a really long steep time, which can taste really good in say an Aeropress or even a French press, that's not giving you more caffeine than you otherwise would have. It's seemingly having little to no impact on the caffeine once you cross that threshold of steep time where you're getting what you need out. I don't understand this and I feel like this is one particular area that needs loads more testing but there's a lot more to talk about. So we need to talk about instant coffee. And this is one area - this is THE area where I've made the biggest mistake and essentially spread the most misinformation by mistake. Now I'll give you an anecdote that I've heard quite often, people often said to me, \"I used to drink instant and now I drink specialty, I drink fresh coffee. And I feel like there's way more caffeine in that\". And I would typically reply \"that seems surprising because instant coffee pretty much everywhere is mostly made with Robusta, as a species, which has twice the caffeine content of Arabica\". And I was also pretty confident that during the extraction process that would've gotten all of the caffeine out of the Robusta. And so my theory had been, my presumption had been there was more caffeine in instant coffee than there would've been in fresh coffee because fresh coffee was made of better quality coffee that started with less caffeine in there. Then I did some testing and it did not go the way I thought it would. Instant coffee compared to a pour over has way, way less caffeine in it. This is a slightly tricky thing to say because obviously the way that you make instant coffee will have a big impact on how much caffeine is in there. Now if you get a jar of Nescafe gold, you don't have to, but if you did, it will tell you on the side to take 1.8 grams of instant and mix that into 200 mls of hot water. They are proposing you a cup of coffee that is incredibly weak, actually, a 0.9% strength compared to a typical filter coffee that would be say 1.3 to 1.6, somewhere in that range. So they're saying: brew it weak. And, you know, maybe for good reason. What we wanted to do was actually have instant be a comparable strength to filter coffee to compare those two things. So we then took 3 grams of instant for 200 mls of water, which then gave us a 1.5% strength beverage at the end of it. So how much caffeine are we talking about? Now here, rather than talk about total beverage amounts here, we're gonna talk about caffeine concentrations per 100 mls, per deciliter. Instant coffee made the way they tell you to had just under 40 milligrams of caffeine per deciliter. If you made it the way that we might to get the matching strength, that would go up to 60 milligrams per deciliter, roughly speaking. A lot of the pour overs that we measured were actually more like 80 milligrams per deciliter. That means if you made two matching size cups of industry standard instant versus industry standard pour over, you might have twice the caffeine per serving in the specialty coffee. This to me was shocking, it was astonishing. And what I had massively underestimated and kind of forgotten about was just how much of those grounds instant coffee manufacturers are extracting. We tend to see a ceiling of about 30% being the maximum. Instant coffee manufacturers are able to go higher through a number of processes. They're just using way, way, way less coffee beans per cup of coffee and then getting you to make it pretty weak. Now we did go out and test the cheapest, strongest, harshest instant we could find, presuming that to be the purest kind of Robusta, and therefore probably the highest caffeine. That was higher. But again, at industry standard 0.9% strength, that was still only 55 milligrams of caffeine per deciliter. So still not near the caffeine strength of good specialty coffee. This has definitely been misinformation I've spread. I apologize for this now. I did not realize how wrong I was but if you have a friend or colleague that seems to get through like five cups of instant coffee a day and be fine, well this is why. It just doesn't have that much caffeine in it compared to good fresh coffee. As a side note, we did at one point measure the concentration of a V60 brewed with Lavazza, which is obviously some Robusta in that. It's still fresh coffee. How is the caffeine concentration there? Yeah, it was over 100 milligrams per deciliter. So you know, again, cheaper raw materials and Lavazza Rossa does have some Robusta in it, will have more caffeine in them. So specialty is less caffeine than cheaper fresh coffee but it's still more than instant. The last test that I wanted to do for this video was one that I get asked about a lot. I was asked about it in the recent video I did with Wired on their channel for doing coffee support. And that is, is it true that there is less caffeine in darker roasted coffee? It a question you get asked a lot. The reason people ask it is the fact that caffeine sublimates, which means it goes from being a solid to a gas at temperatures achieved in the upper ends of roasting temperatures. The idea is that as you roast a coffee dark, you're driving caffeine out of the bean, it's sublimating out, and so dark roasts have less caffeine in them. I was always highly skeptical of this but I wanted to test it. And so we took a coffee, one particular coffee, we did a sample roast of it to a slightly underdeveloped, under roasted way, a kind of normal roast, and then a dark roast into what's called second crack which is a stage in roasting that would be a measurement point for darker roasts. You could go much darker than this but I didn't really want to. Then we would take each of those three samples and brew them as a pour over to matching extraction levels. Then we'd compare the caffeine and the results were super, super interesting. Turns out the dark roast filter brew had the highest concentration of caffeine and it was a pretty big difference. So the dark roast brew for a matching extraction in terms of total solubles was 72 milligrams of caffeine per deciliter. The medium roast, traditional normal roast, had about 67.5 milligrams of caffeine in it. And the very light, slightly underdeveloped roast had 62 milligrams per deciliter of caffeine in it. So that's a pretty large swing there. Now I think there's two reasons for this. Firstly, the longer you roast coffee, the less dense it gets. Like that 10 kilos of coffee you might load into a commercial roaster, what you're getting out at the end of it is going down the longer you roast. So a light roast, you might end up with only 8.5 kilos, with a really dark roast, you may only end up with, say, 8 kilos of coffee. Now a lot of what goes away is moisture but other stuff does essentially degrade and disappear out during the roasting process. This means that to make up, say, 10 grams of coffee, you would need more dark roasted coffee beans. But this doesn't explain everything because actually if you count how many dark roasted coffee beans we needed for 10 grams versus the the medium roast versus the light, well medium to dark, you needed about 7% on average more coffee beans to make up 10 grams of coffee. But we were seeing an increase in caffeine of around 8.5%. So it wasn't just that you needed more beans. That darker roasted coffee is more porous, it's less dense, and I think part of that means it's even easier to extract every scrap of caffeine that's in there. Conversely, that drop in caffeine that we saw with the under-roasted coffee meant that it might just be harder to get the caffeine out from a much denser, less roasted coffee bean, as well as you just need less beans to make up your dose of coffee that you're gonna start with. This I thought was super interesting and it kind of goes with my own experience and my own kind of theories coming into this. So I was pleased to be proved right, but I definitely didn't expect the swing that we saw from light to medium to dark in terms of total concentration. A highlight of the video for me, a highlight of the testing! Now one thing I do wanna acknowledge at this point is that you'll see different numbers at different times for the same brew method. You'll see a pour over that seems to yield 65 or 70 milligrams in one case and a pour over, same recipe, that yields say 80 milligrams per deciliter in another place. Different coffees do have different caffeine levels in them and that definitely showed up in our testing. What we would definitely do when we were testing something was use the same coffee for say espresso and filter or the same coffee for all of the tests to try and isolate that variable. But coffee itself is a variable. Generally when we saw Ethiopian coffees used, they seem to have fractionally less caffeine than other coffees we used. We didn't see a massive variance amongst high quality, high growing specialty coffees but we did see some variance and the amount of testing we would need to do to give you guidance there is enormous. It's on the list, but it's enormous. Generally speaking, I think we know that caffeine is the plant's response to insects and that the higher you grow coffee, the less caffeine the plant tends to produce. I think that's a good, very broad rule of thumb that will absolutely have exceptions to it, but it's a good place to start. But yeah, know that some of the variance you'll see in those final numbers is down to the fact that the coffee used was different 'cause we wanted to test lots of coffee, lots of grinders, lots of brewers, all of that kind of stuff, to get to useful actionable insights about how you're gonna brew and drink and enjoy coffee day-to-day. Now, I know there's other tests you'd probably like me to do and I want to hear about them down in the comments below. What should I have tested, what's left out there that you really want to know? I'd love to hear your thoughts and your ideas. And even if you don't have an idea, let me know which of these tests was the most interesting or relevant to you, which was the biggest surprise. I have really enjoyed this video. This has been a massive learning experience for me.", "videoID": "etnMr8oUSDo"}, {"title": "3D Printing Coffee Stuff", "text": "So I've got a 3D printer. I mean, I know you know that, you've seen the title in the thumbnail of this video, but it was something I'd thought about for a really long time, but had held off from, because I'm not sure I need more hobbies in my life. But I was browsing Thingiverse one day, which is a kind of online resource of free models to download and print yourself. And I just was searching for coffee stuff and there was a lot, and I wanted to know what it was like. And I thought I would find out and share that experience with you for a video, 'cause it's kind of interesting, you know, can you print your own coffee accessories? Should you print your own coffee accessories or get a friend to do it? So I printed five different things for this video and I'll go through each one of them and talk about why I picked it, why I think it's interesting and what the kind of implications of all of this stuff is as 3D printing becomes kind of a thing that is everywhere. Now, I bought a Prusa if you care about these things. I bought a kit, I don't know if I would buy it again. It wasn't difficult to build, but it wasn't easy to build. I guess it was satisfying to build, you know, I understand what all the pieces do and how it all works, and that's kind of a good thing I think long-term, if I wanna upgrade pieces of the printer or that kind of stuff. But wow, did I underestimate how long it would take me, but it got to working and I started printing and I love it. I love it, it's just, it's incredibly satisfying and it's everything I feared it would be, but let's talk about some prints because I think there's some cool stuff here. Now, frustratingly Thingiverse has a kind of tip function where you can tip the creators and I wanted to do that, but most of them don't appear to have that function set up on there. I will be trying to track them down to compensate them in some way for having contributed to this video, 'cause I think that's really only fair, but they've designed and shared some cool stuff. And it's free, you can just go there, take the model and print it, and if you own a printer, the cost of printing is negligible. Oh yeah, one more important thing, I am like the person who just bought their first espresso machine and it is finally getting like good espresso at home. I am very excited, I am excited about this hobby, I know nothing really beyond how to do what I'm doing right now and I have nothing really to teach anyone yet. So don't take any, I'm not gonna teach you anything meaningful about 3D printing today. 'Cause I don't know anything meaningful about 3D printing. Let's talk about the prints, 'cause the first one just kind of blew my mind with the fact that it exists or that it didn't exist outside of Thingiverse. It's this, made by a user called Jayuk. I think this is brilliant, do you know what this is for? Let me show you what this is for. This is a moka pot sort of basket stand 'cause those are stupid things to dose. Let me just get one. Now the problem with this part of the design and being weird about coffee is that weighing, so your dose into this is not easy. You're trying to balance this on a set of scales, come on. When you balance, there you go. Precarious, awful, as an experience but someone just made this, a little stand. It's just a little stand that you can just put your thing in dose your coffee and it won't fall down. I just think that's cool. I just think somebody saw a problem and created a fix that no one else was gonna fix, right? Because only certain numbers of moka pot users care about this, or I would worry about this. But I just love that it's fixed and for pennies. I have a solution to a problem that I genuinely have had and someone made this and shared it for free. One of the things I do worry about as I make this video is that someone will watch this video and be like, \"Oh, I make things, my business makes things, that's cool. I should make that, I should take this design that's available for free and commercialize it or just tweak it slightly and do that.\" Don't do that, it's not cool, that's not okay. We'll find you and call you and be mean about you on the internet. If that counts for anything. I just think this is a great little innovation, a great little solution to a problem. And it's kinda available to people who care enough to wanna fix the problem. Anyway, Jayuk the guy that kind of made this or shared this or uploaded this to Thingiverse, thank you very much. I appreciate this, this is definitely gonna go into rotation and use in this kind of thing. And I should probably do an updated video on the moka pot soon. Now that was genuinely the first thing that I printed and the second thing that I printed is a little bit dull, but also just kind of cool. It's this and I'm consistently impressed by how nice it feels. I mean, I've had 3D printed stuff in the past, I've had 3D printed parts on equipment or kind of 3D printed accessories bundled in with stuff, and I'd never really thought about what could I make at home. Now, as you've noticed, the set has slightly changed, we're moving spaces and kind of rebuilding the kind of kitchen set. And these, I'm gonna print a couple of these, are gonna go in there. It's a wall-mounted portafilter holder. Three screws mounts on the wall, take your portafilter and just click it in. And it fits beautifully, really well. This is obviously designed for the kind of 58 mil side-on lug, so something like Simonelli portafilter or Victoria Arduino portafilter wouldn't fit in this the right way, but for the kind of standard side on logs, 58 mils, really nice fit, credits to Jim Higson, the user who uploaded this in 2017 for making and sharing this. I think it is delightful, but speaking of espresso and portafilters, the next thing I printed was a little bit bigger again, was this, it's a thing, it's a bit confusing. It's designed specifically for the Niche grinder, which I just so happen to have here. Now with the Niche, typically you would have a dosing cup like this, this is the new one, it's very nice. And it sits there and you grind that and give it a shake and put in your portafilter, but maybe you don't wanna do that, maybe you want a different workflow. Maybe you wanna grind straight into the portafilter. Now I don't know how many Niches are out there in the world, but it's a good amount. But as a percentage, the people who wanna grind straight into a portafilter, not high. So no one's gonna build a solution for you and commercialize it, I suspect, but you can 3D print one. If you take this off and this off you'll see this little bolt here, let's just take this bolt out. And then this goes on there and now you're grinding, oh, you're just grinding straight in, straight in. Now again, the thing that's kind of interesting to me is you might wanna change this slightly, you might want this slightly higher up, slightly lower down, it depends. You can do that if you want to. Now this looks like it could get a bit messy, it might've benefited from having like a dosing ring around it. But of course I made one, I printed a dosing ring because you can, it sits inside the portafilter because you can, because it's easy, how delightful. What I liked about the model for this one actually came with choices of how you wanted to do your dosing rings. You can have one like this that sits inside the portafilter, the same user, the same files. There's variations of how you wanna do it, and it's all just, it's just there. So now, you can do it so neatly and it fits beautifully, perfectly. Now, it is important to acknowledge once something like ground coffee is touching this stuff. This is PLA and PLA is not food safe. So if I was to make this for kinda regular usage, I might switch to something like PETG, but just for this video for demonstration and for me learning what I'm doing, PLA super easy to work with, had lots and yeah, I made a dosing funnel that works really nicely. Now the last thing I wanna show you, I need a portafilter with the dosing funnel and to show you, and I think it's really cool, probably the coolest one of all of them if I'm honest, though it is a bit more work and it isn't just PLA, there's more stuff. But I think it's just cool. Now, if you're thinking I want one of these, but I don't have a printer. Well, hang around for a second because this video has a sponsor, has an ad in it. It means I'm gonna print a few of these different things and just give them a way to you if you have no way of accessing a 3D printer, if you've got no friend with a 3D printer, if that's just impossible to you, we'll do a little giveaway and that's possible because this video has an ad for Squarespace.

So this terrifying looking thing is a nine pronged WDT tool, white or vice I've seen whites, I don't know, distribution tool. And it's designed to break apart the clumps in your bed of coffee. And this one is great, it's really good. And just to show you what I mean, you would use it to sort of whisk around the grounds here, make them all fluffy, breakup any clumps. Lovely, beautiful results, better extraction, more evenness. I haven't done a video on puck prep and I'm going to, I'm gonna discuss a load of different distribution tools like these kinds of things, but broadly speaking in many, many, many scenarios, I think they're really good. I think they're useful, I think they help you make better coffee, I think they're worth the time and effort, and I just love that there's a 3D printed one that is this good. Now this is uploaded by a user called JK makes and it's kind of two pieces. There is a separate sort of holder for it that you can print that you can kind of leave it in. But the two pieces are very simple, they're just thread together. You got a sort of top part of the handle and then inside you have these. Now, ironically, you buy these to clean the nozzles on 3D printers, it's just a little pin for doing that and works well, but you can use them to make a distribution tool. I bought these from Amazon, I'll leave a link down below if you wanna sort of get some of these needles for that sort of stuff. I'm not sure I'd recommend like just buying one and doing this, I think having nine of them in one sort of thing is very cool. They're obviously kind of commercially available versions of these tools now, pretty widely available on a bunch of different websites from different manufacturers. This is a touch cheaper, probably 20 pounds worth of filament here and seven pounds worth of needles, which you could probably get cheaper if you hunted them out a little bit more. I didn't do a lot of hunting, I just went with the ones that could get quickly and easily. But yeah, that's probably seven pounds 50, by the time I factored in electricity and all the rest of it or whatever else. So it's cheap, but I will say as a tool this 3D printed open-source tool is as good as anything anyone is making anywhere, and I think that's great. I do clear there's a big community around 3D printing, there's a big community around coffee. I think obviously crossovers is super interesting there too, but yeah, genuinely impressed, like it fits together really nicely, it looks really good. It works really well and I made it, I mean, I didn't, I just pushed go on a printer, but I feel like I made it and that counts for something these days. It was satisfying to create this thing. Now I'm not gonna say it's all easy and perfect all of the time, I've had failed prints, you know, along the way. My first attempt at this kind of went wrong and the print failed about halfway through, which was maddening. I've had prints not stick to the beds quite early on, but to me it has been an unexplored aspect of the kinda wider online communities. And I've just wanted to print some stuff, try some stuff and show it to you, 'cause I think it's cool. I think people are inventing really interesting solutions to problems and sharing them with everybody.", "videoID": "X3bEjJ_S2V0"}, {"title": "Review\uff1a All of IKEA's Coffee Stuff", "text": "This is going to be a little bit different than usual, Now, because this video has a sponsor, it's sponsored by NordVPN, I took this as an opportunity, to do something I wouldn't usually do. I often do reviews and I have a Patreon supports that, but here, no no no. This was a chance to do something a little bit different, and I needed to go to IKEA so I thought, \"Why don't I go to IKEA and just buy all of the coffee things, and review them, and then give them away?\" So, let's see. What does IKEA have and ultimately, is it any good? It's a pound. It's a pound. Hand grinder, 22 pounds. Is that real? Is that actually a product? Organic dark roast coffee. We're not buying that. 27 pounds. 27 pounds. It's a big French press. I have high hopes. We've got the all important, metal pour-over set. Can't forget little carafe metal filter. The herd? Herd? It's 40p. I'm gonna get two. 40p. Is that? That is a stove top brewer. Sold. You know what? Why not? The haul. So let's see what we have today. Okay, we've got a couple French presses. We got like a little glass guy, and we've got a chunky, chunky little metal one, which is good. In amongst the other stuff, we've got like a travel thermos, and a little travel cup. Oh, we've got a little hand grinder. Got a hand grinder. This thing which is a stove top. Terrifying. Must all carafes be terrible? Let's find out. We've got some 40 pence glass cups, which I don't even understand, but we've got those. We've got some very, I don't know, IKEAry kind of cups here going on. We've got some nice little patterns and things. I need to drink out of something. You know? So that's that. And we've got this weird little, kind of brewing pour-over setup. And then, last but not least, we have the tasteful glass carafe slash pour-over thing. So here's the plan of attack. We're gonna divide and we're gonna conquer all of this stuff together. This is not going to be an in depth review of each product, there just isn't time. We'll answer the top line question, \"Is this good? Is this bad? Is it worth the money or not?\" Nothing here is over 30 pounds, so it's all pretty cheap. So the question is, \"Does it suck?\" Maybe it does. Who knows. So we'll start by looking at the hand grinder, then we'll have a look at the French presses, then we'll do some pour-over goodness, we'll maybe drink from some cups as we're doing those things, and finish with a little bit of moka pot goodness. Let's have a look at this 22 pound grinder. We've got in here your classic set of what look like very plasticy white ceramic bears. What I will say, there's a little spongey bit on the bottom here, that's kind of nice. I guess that's to keep it nice and fixed on the table for when you're hand grinding, which is a nice touch. I'd be shocked if... Yeah that's pretty much it. The crush grind little bear set. Interesting to see. It says sort of crush grind. Oh dear. It's really plasticy. That's not nice to adjust. All right. Now this is a weird... Actually just looking at it right now, this is a weird container to grind into, as a sort of shape, that is just a bit odd. I can imagine coffee getting stuck in that. Let's just throw a little handful in. I'm not sure I wanna grind this whole handful. Feels like a hand grinder. All right, let's have a look. Let's have a look, see at the state of this. So we've gone kind of like medium, medium fine I would guess. Okay, that's kind of a mess. I mean, that's a mess. These grinds are ultimately what I would expect to see from a cheap hand grinder. They are wildly variable in size, there's some pretty fine pieces here, there's some big old bouldery pieces too. I'm not gonna be grinding any more coffee with this, because that's just a waste of everyone's time. 20 quid, you get what you pay for. And then we've got these things. We've got two french presses, and they did this one in a bunch of different sizes. I really only saw this in this size. This is the one that feels like you will break it within the first week, right? You'll just tap it on the kitchen counter by mistake and it'll be gone. Gone forever. Super light, super cheap. Not particularly into it on the face value. This little CHONKY BOI. I'm a little bit into this. Like, it's one of the most expensive things in the whole run, I think it was 27 pounds. It is big. It's a good volume in here. It's dual walled, it's stainless steel. It's not like a stunning quality here, like the way that it's brushed at the bottom is very different to the more mirrored sides. Now in here, the plastic just feels cheap. 'Cause it's cheap. And someone who doesn't really press French presses, and check up here if you want to see that video, this is kind of good. Like it will keep the heat. Let's get some coffee into it. Let's get some water boiled, let's get some coffee into it. We're gonna bridge the half liter in each one, which they can comfortably accommodate. So I've got 37 and a half grams of coffee in each. 75 grams a liter is kind of where I'm at for a French press. Try and make sure you get it all. You know, evenly saturated. Now I don't worry about thermal loss, but some people do, so we'll leave the lid on. A little bit down, we're not gonna press, right? We're never gonna press. If you're gonna do this, you can just press it down until it hits the liquid, and that's enough. Don't need to worry about anything else. So these, they're not gonna brew anymore. They're gonna just sit, hang out. The things the fines will fall to the bottom, it'll be good. But they're not brewing, they're not extracting anymore, so don't freak out that I'm gonna make some coffee and not drink this coffee, okay? Cause we have to talk about these. These are the pour-over options from IKEA, and they're basically the same, but not. So you've got this setup which is like a repurposed funnel, I just, I've no idea what's with the pointy bit at the bottom, other than it's literally a repurposed funnel. And then they seem to have just stuck a little piece on here. Sort of badly. Is that actually attached? I presume that's supposed to happen. You can put like a V60 paper in here and you've got some ridgey type things that they have sort of made a small effort with. But it does come with this, which is what the other little glass carafe comes with, which is a metal reusable filter. Metal meshes, tiny holes. No need for a filter paper. These are, as far as I can tell, identical, inside. With the except of the outside, on the rim of this one, there's a little handle, to help you lift it off. Like that. Apparently, if it's in a glass thing, you don't need help lifting it off, you just pick it up like that. Let's make some coffee with them. Considering that this is identical to that, I'll not use this one. I'll put a paper filter in here, and I'll brew this as intended. Now this does have some markings on the side, right? Some little lines. They haven't told you what they are. I feel like they're mocking me. And you. And all of us. Seriously? I mean, is that 100ml? 200ml? I don't know. I have no answers for you, and I'm mad. Let's do, what, like 20 grams, to, say, a third of a liter. So I'm gonna brew this the way I would brew a V60. This is not just an excuse to make you go back and watch my old brewing guides, but there is a link to a brewing guide up in that corner there, if you'd like to click and have a little look. With metal, you need to grind just that little bit finer, because there'll be no resistance from the paper, so the whole brew will happen a little bit quicker that way. All right, we'll leave you here to drain out. Let's put a filter paper in this and see how we go with that. I'll tell you this right now, I'm trying to rinse a filter paper in the sink, this is a horribly designed brewer, designed by somebody who has never used it or intends to use it before. When you stick a giant funnely bit through the bottom... What am I doing with this? What is... This is awful. This is awful. Now, in looking for something to brew, on top of with this monstrosity, it seemed a good chance to use this, the little travel thermos that came from IKEA today. The V60 paper does not fit this well. This feels like it's draining a bit slower then a V60 would. I don't really know why. I think it's just because this hates me. And I hate it. And we understand each other that way. See, this sometimes happens with Chemexes, where the seal ends up being too good, or something? I don't even understand. All right, enough of you. So, what have we got? Alongside our little travel thermos, we should also test our little travel cup, which is a pound, and don't you feel it when you hold this. So, that's a pound. And then we've got our travel press. And these cups came from IKEA, so maybe they're good. I mean it's metal filtered pour-over coffee. Which to me is entirely fine, if often a little bit muddy. Our big CHONKY BOI. Hot. Clean. Pretty good. Really pretty good. Our travel cup. I'm not an entirely, you know, surface level person, but, you know, I'm not that shallow and vain. Despite the hair. But if I was walking out in the street holding this, I'd feel not proud of myself. This is... I mean, I feel like I'm drinking from a child's cup. I mean, it's definitely a cup. That has a lid. That is a pound. The fancy travel thermos. This comes with a special lid, so, in theory, this is sealed right now, and then you would, click it to drink. And click it again to seal it. So, in theory, nothing comes out. And nothing does come out, which is a great relief. And then we can open to drink. That's exactly as hot as a fresh brewed coffee in a thermos is. That's not a particularly good pour-over, because that pour-over is trash. Is made of trash. I think they've just found metal in the skip out the back, was, sort of, roughly shaped into a funnel, and then, I don't know. I just hate it. I just, I hate it. This I quite like. That's okay. This, if you need a little travel thermos, I don't hate it. I don't love the colors, but it does not leak when you don't want it to leak. This I'm not that in to. These cups are kind of fine. This has won my heart so far. Nah, not really. And the little, the little nonsense here. Nah. Nah, I would not... I would go and buy a proper one, from someone like Hario, or one of those other companies that do these and do them well. I'm not sold that the glass will be long lasting on this thing. There is one brewer left and that is the moka pot type thing. I will need to do a little bit of a set change, get my induction hob ready to do that, and while I do that, I'm gonna tell you about the video sponsor, which is NordVPN, that has enabled this journey, that we've all taken so far. Now, NordVPN actually the service that I use as a VPN. And I like a VPN for a few different reasons. Firstly, it adds a layer of privacy to your activity online, it would mean that someone at your ISP couldn't see your traffic. More than that, for me, it acts kind of like an ad-blocker, preventing me being tracked across the web in a way that I just don't like at all. Now, as someone who travels a lot, being able to act like my laptop is in whichever country I want is actually super useful. Not just for watching whichever version of Netflix that I fancy that day. It's also incredibly useful if I'm somewhere like China, where there's a firewall that would traditionally stop me accessing the services that I need every day.

So we return to do the moka pot type deal, which is kind of interesting. Now I had a pleasant surprise, a quick test, this is not aluminum, and it works on induction hobs directly, which is great news. So, to the bottom of this, we're gonna add our hot water, If you look up there, I bet there's a video about how to brew with a moka pot, that I helped make. That would be good. So, coffee, not tamped down, not super finely ground. Get that all tightly locked in, against your gasket, a little handle. I'm not against this so far. There you are. So we're brewing. So a quick rinse with cold water, just to stop it brewing, and we have coffee. This is our 40p little glass thing. I'm not gonna pour a lot of coffee here, because one, it's strong, and two, it's hot. I'm a bit conflicted. That it works on induction, I think is a super big win, I think that's great that it works on induction. I think it's ugly, I think it's ugly. It's pretty ugly, right? That's not a beautiful thing. But it's cheap. It works on induction, it seems reasonably well made. The handle I like more than I feel like I should, and if you use it right, you get a nice cup of coffee out of it too. So this is a kind of medium endorsement. If you don't think this is hideous, it's not bad. It's really not that bad. Before we wrap, there was one more thing. There was a carafe there, and I wanted to know if all carafes are bad carafes, and if a cheap IKEA carafe was a bad IKEA carafe. Does it pour nicely? No it does not. I mean, how hard is it to get a spout to focus liquid? Look, look at this. Look at this. Who wants liquid to pour like this? Who is signing this off? What are you doing? IKEA, you disappoint me.

That's what happens when you go to IKEA and you buy everything they have that makes coffee, and you test it, and now you know, and I've done this so you don't have to.", "videoID": "GeI9DHf1Vkw"}, {"title": "Review\uff1a Aram Espresso Maker", "text": "Today we're gonna review this, it's the Aram Espresso Maker. It's a manual espresso maker from Brazil. And I know what you're thinking, it looks like a grinder. And it does, but it's not. It doesn't grind coffee. This is just for making espresso, and it's quite interesting. Now, this is a highly, highly requested review. Lots of you wanna know what I think about this, and I can see why. Now this is expensive. It's $495 US before shipping. And what you get is what you see here. You get the espresso maker in the middle, you get the base and sort of stand piece here, you get a little glass that's actually quite clever, a little dosing funnel, and a tamper to go with it. Let me show you how it works. So this here is the basket piece of the whole puzzle, and it's just a standard 53 ml basket. I think this one has La Spaziale on the side, and it sits inside this piece that helps it screw into the body of the machine. Like so. And this is where things get interesting. You put your hot water in the top here. And what's inside is a piston head attached to this central threaded piece. So what happens is when you unscrew the central piece, this is causing that piston head to lift up, and the water is pulled through it through a one-way valve. So that when you fully unwound it, what you should have is your bed of coffee, your hot water, and then your piston head. And what you're gonna do is twist the handle to build the pressure to push the water through the bed of coffee. Now, I don't know what pressure you can get up to with this thing. You can get pretty high, but I'm not sure how high. Now, if you are out and about, you can just clip the little glass it comes with in here and it stays, which is a nice little thing. But if you bring it home, what you'd wanna do is use the stand that it comes with. Now this is a hefty and well-made thing. There's a base piece that has a drip tray in it, which is very nice, and then the clamp here that holds it in place. To put it in, you do you have to remove the basket, sit it on top, tighten it up. But can it make good coffee? That's really the question before we even get to is it worth $500? And the answer is yes. Yes, it can. With a few caveats. I don't think it's the most versatile espresso brewer, but I think you can get some really delicious espresso out of it. And that's what we should do right now, we should make some espresso with it. And what I would strongly recommend when using this is that you run a preheat cycle, at least one preheat cycle. So I'm gonna put some hot water in this. I'm gonna prep my ground coffee, get it packed and tamped, rinse it through, and then we'll make some coffee. So we're just gonna pour until it's full, and then we're gonna leave it. What I've got here actually is a thermometer. I've just put a thermocouple into the body of the brewer to see what's happening to the temperature. And generally I found that if you put 95 Celsius water into a totally cold brewer, it dropped to the mid-60s. This thing soaks up a lot of heat. It's solid, it's heavy, it's a big heat sink. And thermal management with this brewer is definitely an issue. We wanna leave this a couple of minutes, but at some point, it won't get hotter than 65, and we need to, potentially for using a pretty light roast coffee, do a second round of preheating. If you wanna use something a little bit more developed, a little bit darker, you're probably fine to brew straightaway. But I have so far struggled really to get this thing brewing in the 90s in terms of degrees Celsius, not anywhere near close to 100 Fahrenheit, for those of you with the ancient money of temperature. So we're just gonna use something to dump this water into. And as I lift this up, water will flow through, and all the way back down again. Now to dose our coffee, that's pretty simple. You get a little funnel to put it in. They recommend a pretty heavy dose, and from my experience, I think that's a pretty good idea. And so this is 19 grams of coffee in. You got a neat little tamper with it. If you already had, say, a Spaziale, you'd probably use whatever tamper you'd like. Now, occasionally I would get a bit frustrated because the action of screwing this in can be a little bit finicky, just to find the start of the thread. If we screw it nice and tight, we are good to go. Now we're gonna need a little weighing scale to put under here, and then some hot water in the top, and then we can go. Now as I start to lift up, that will effectively start a pre-infusion phase. Water will be going through the piston head and starting to soak into the coffee below. And again, if I wanted to, I could only go a certain number of turns up before pushing down again. By going all the way to the top, I will end up with more water in the brewer than I may want to use for an espresso. But counting turns it's not really a viable thing for me. So we're at the top, and then we're gonna go pretty quickly to build up some pressure. And suddenly it should get hard to brew. Now at this point, we'll probably at reasonably high pressures, and that's a good thing. And we're just gonna keep the pressure there. Now because I've got more liquid above the coffee than I actually wanna push through it, I'm brewing on a scale and I'm essentially gonna pull it out of the way when I get to my desired beverage weight, which is about 38 to 40 grams out. And there's our espresso. It smells pretty good. We should obviously give it a stir. I've had some pretty tasty shots, and that's one of them. It's got nice texture. It's well-extracted. It tastes like it was brewed at a slightly lower pressure than nine bars. I will struggle to verbalize to you how I know that or what that tastes like, but it's slightly a textural thing coupled with that extraction thing. I would want that extra temperature just to round it out, sweeten it up a little bit more, get rid of some of that slightly unpleasant acidity that is in that espresso. If you like darker roasts, I think you wouldn't really have a temperature problem. But I think if you like pretty light roasts, whatever you define as light roasts, but certainly something that's not near second crack, then you're gonna struggle a little bit to hit the kind of temperatures that you want. Now in terms of grind size, grind fussiness, you're definitely gonna need a good grinder for this. I was going just slightly coarser than I would have done for, say, 19 grams going into a pump-powered electric espresso machine. So again, it suggests maybe we're not working at pressures of nine bars or close to it. You want a grinder where you've got a good amount of control of your grind setting, and you would be essentially at an espresso grind setting. So that's how it works. You've seen how you make coffee with it. What I'll do now is clean up a little bit and give you a kind of summary of my thoughts about the build, the machine, and the user experience. So let's start with the build, because this thing is $495 US, the build must have something to do with it, and it certainly does. Everything is really beautifully made here. No corners have been cut. The wood on the outside of this is local in Brazil. It's stunning. The way the metal is machined is very good. The base is extremely solid. It is a very well-made thing. In terms of longevity, it does have some seals inside it where the piston will be moving around the chamber, and any seal will degrade over time, but I think there's only a couple of seals in it, I think two or three. They're not particularly complicated to change, I don't think, and they're not expensive to change either. So most of it, it's designed, I think, to be a long-lasting product, not something that you would consider a disposable purchase. In terms of user experience, it's okay. The need to do substantial preheating is a bit frustrating for me. That's a downside. I think the locking in and out of the brew basket can be a little bit fiddly and frustrating, and that's a small downside for me. An upside for sure is how portable this thing is. Of all of the manual espresso makers that I've used, this is by far the most portable. The fact that it comes out of the stand, that the glass clicks into the bottom I think is really nice and really thoughtful. And while it is portable, it is heavy. It's a solid, solid thing. So if you're thinking just casually throw it in some luggage and not worry about the weight, you're gonna notice it. It's definitely heavy. The biggest question on UI, UX kind of stuff is, is it better to spin a handle around and around, or to pull a lever down? Is one better than the other? And I will say that it feels easier to spin the handle, even when it gets pretty hard work. It doesn't feel quite as muscular, almost, as the pressing action at the peak of pressing on a lever machine. But I'm also not sure I'm generating the same kinds of pressures doing it that way. The one upside of a lever machine is that feeling of a very direct feedback. Right, you pull and you feel the puck push back, almost, against you. It's quite a tactile experience, it's quite pleasant. That's a little bit more disconnected here. Certainly the way that you spin, you can feel some level of feedback from the pressure inside the unit, but it's a very indirect kind of feeling compared to the directness of a lever. I'm not sure I would say one is better or worse, but I could certainly see people having strong preferences one way or the other. I do wish it had some sort of pressure gauge, or the ability to be modified to have a pressure gauge, but the nature of this kind of a brewer means that you could never really have that in an easy or simple way. So you'll always be a little bit blind in that regard. Now, to clean it, it's pretty easy. You take out your brew basket, and then you would knock it out. You can knock it out against knock box, you can knock it into a bin. It's literally just a basket sat in a holder. So it's incredibly easy to clean. And then this here you can see one of the gaskets here on the outside, and then your dispersion screen here. Keeping this clean has been really pretty easy. Again, there's no back flush needed on this because there's no pressure release back through the dispersion screen the way that there is in a commercial espresso machine. Pretty easy to clean. Which leaves us the last question, can it make great coffee? I think the answer is it can make very good coffee for a good number of people, but I think it doesn't quite have the flexibility and the range of brewing of something like the Flair, or the Robot, or the ROK. Those all had issues with preheating, but this one I think has a bigger issue with preheating. I just think it's a much bigger mass that you're trying to preheat, the nature of this chamber is kind of different. And also the sort of timings, it feels a little bit slower and you worry about heat loss from that perspective, too. If high temperatures aren't essential to you, then you may really enjoy owning this espresso machine. And it is an enjoyable thing to use. I've really enjoyed making coffee, making espresso in more manual ways recently. This is certainly not the end of my journey in that regard. Now this machine I don't get to keep, as beautiful as it is, because this review is powered by my Patreon. I have supporters on Patreon who give me a budget to go out and buy these things, and so I'm not reliant on manufacturers giving them to me. I don't have to do biased reviews. I can be honest about what I think and tell you my truth.", "videoID": "xlUxtgM_Ipc"}, {"title": "Understanding The AeroPress (Episode #2)", "text": "Welcome to Understanding The AeroPress. This is gonna be a big, giant dive into the AeroPress, and how to brew with the AeroPress. Here's how it's gonna work. We're gonna look at all of the individual variables around AeroPress brewing. One of the delights of this brewer is that you can isolate your variables and play with them a little bit more. So that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna ask and answer a bunch of questions. Now, I will make sure that each individual experiment is timestamped down below. If you want to jump to that, if you wanna go back to a particular experiment and see more about it. I'm going to use my trusty refractometer, my fancy cupping spoon. And hopefully we're gonna learn some really interesting things today. So brew a cup of coffee, maybe not a big cup, cause you might wanna brew another one at the end of this. Two notes before we begin: Firstly, where we're doing extraction and measurement, I don't want you to really worry or look at the numbers. They are, you know, correlated to the coffee being used, the grinder being used, which is not the same as what you're using. What we're interested in is trends. Like what does a change do to extraction, broadly speaking? So we're not gonna obsess over numbers. And secondly, there's a mixture of tastings here. Some are kinda performative tastings where I've done the experiments a lot before. And a few of these will actually be me tasting these experiments for the first time. Those kinds of tests will be blind while the other ones won't necessarily be blind. Hope that makes sense. Time for experiment one. The most obvious of them, I suppose. Which is how long should I steep my AeroPress for? And the way we're gonna look at it is this. I'm gonna take a standard technique. I'm gonna brew 12 grams to 200 grams of water. I'm gonna pour all the water in one go. We're gonna use the plunger to create a little vacuum on top, to hold the brewer as it steeps. And we'll give it a stir at the end of the steep time, and we'll gently press. We will do this with six different brew times. With 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 90 seconds, 120 seconds, 240 seconds and 480 seconds, same grind for all of them. And we'll be able to see how extraction is changed by immersion time. Of course, this isn't unique to AeroPress brewing, but it is one of the big questions, where am I diminishing returns and brew time? So let's answer that now. So here we've got our six brews from that experiment going from 30 seconds up to four minutes in time. And if we look at the data, unsurprisingly we see a rapid increase in extraction early on beginning to flatten out towards this end here. And from a taste perspective, that's not very nice. It's not bad. It's just not very nice. Better, a little bit more texture, a bit more body. And as we get to this point, certainly by here, things are tasting pretty good. And I would argue for this particular grind setting, we're hitting a point of diminishing returns between two and four minutes. As we get from two minutes to four minutes, there is that little bump in quality. I think it does get a little bit sweeter in this particular, simple test, but certainly in a cafe environment, I'm not sure that I'd be willing to put the extra time in, especially because, you know, no one would be tasting these two side by side and picking and choosing. On its own, this is a nice cup. At eight minutes, it's very nice still. Again, we doubled our brew time from here to here. I'm not sure we've seen, really, a good return on our investment. You know, it's a tiny bit better, but not really much in this situation. For me for this grind setting, I'd be looking at a two-minute brew. Now, you might argue well, what about different grind settings? And that's a good point. If you look at the same experiment done, say, a coarser grind you'll see that the coarser you grind, the sort of the lower your maximum extraction is gonna be, because you have less surface area, and the slower that extraction is. Okay, well, then the ideal therefore is to go as fine as possible and brew as fast as possible, then that's the most efficient thing, right? Well, maybe, but maybe not. Something we will touch on a little bit later on. On now to our next experiment. So this test, relatively simple actually. You'll notice in the previous brew, before we plunged, we gave it a little stir. Well, what's actually happening there? Is there a big kick in extraction when we stir? How much of a difference does that make? So we'll do a side-by-side with a couple of different grind settings. Doing essentially that same recipe with a stir and with no stir, just to see how that process, how that little addition impacts extraction and flavour. So here's our test brewed. Our coarser set here, no stir and stir, and our finer grounds set here, no stir and stir. Starting at the courser set, really interesting difference here. The stir has made a massive difference, actually. This cup is incredibly weak and empty and boring and hollow and dull, and has been improved quite a lot by a stir. So it's definitely bumped up the extraction quite a lot, and actually when it came to looking at the numbers, a lot, a shocking amount here. However, where we've gone finer to start with, and we were already operating at a sort of close to the ceiling level of extraction because we're grinding much finer extractions happening much quicker, the stir, well, a different story. Yes, there is an incremental increase in extraction with the stir, but it's not huge, right? Because we've already done a good job extracting by having a finer grind, that stir didn't make as big of a difference as it did over here, where we'd done a much worse job extracting with the coarser grind setting, super interesting. It would be one where if I had a coarser grind, and I was stuck with it, then I'd be thinking a lot more about using this, and making sure that I was stirring adequately to get those extraction numbers up. Whereas with a fine grind, I'd be worrying a little less and certainly not being too aggressive with it, you know, just a gentle stir I think is plenty. Now, in the theme of stirring, one thing I now wanna check is, is is there any difference between stirring and swirling? You know from my V60 technique that I really like to swirl that kind of movement that is kind of uniform in its action on all the coffee, whereas, you know, stirring is typically more localized around the spoon. In a V60, a bigger deal, in a small AeroPress, maybe not as much. So we'll do a swirl versus stir test two times just like this with the finer setting and the coarser setting. See if there's really any difference, whether it's stirred or swirled. An interesting test. I think with the coarser set, once again, you sort of see the impact of the difference more than you do where the set is ground kind of finer, at the sort of finer end of things. Here, there's quite a noticeable difference between the two cups, and there's definitely a little bump in extraction with the swirl. And I do prefer the swirl, just for that little extra richness to the cup. Now, this is obviously not the first time I've done these tests. I've historically preferred swirling over stirring from blind testing through measurement, all that kind of stuff. And the same, broadly, is true here. There's not much in it, at the finer ground setting, there really isn't but there's a little kind of extra kick of sweetness and uniformity in that one that isn't there in this, it's a little bit muddier and harsher compared to that one there. It's a single brew. But I think it's a good demonstration of a broader effect. So my preference has always been for swirling though at finer settings, I don't think it matters that much. Next up is a test that will involve some blind testing for me. So new territory, which is kind of interesting, and that is testing the bloom. Blooming is very common in pour over brewing, where you add a little bit of hot water to the grounds and let them sort of steep, let them degas a little bit so that you have a higher chance of an even extraction afterwards. Get rid of that CO2 that's in the grounds that can be a bit of a troublemaker. Typically, this isn't done in immersion brewing, but it is done by some people in AeroPress brewing. Here's the test. We're gonna brew two AeroPresses side-by-side. One will have a bloom for about 30 seconds and then an additional 1 minute 30 of steeping. And the other one we'll just have a two minutes steep, and they'll be brewed otherwise identically. We'll do that twice, with the same grind setting, actually, to really dig into this. And then they'll be put into a blind triangle tasting for me while I'll have to pick the odd one, out of three bowls each time. If you're not familiar with triangle tests, they are a better than an AB, because I have to, you know, get one in three right twice instead of 50/50 twice. So the odds of me being accidentally correct are much lower. You can do two out of fives. Those are - or three out of fives, those are tougher still. But triangles I think are enough for today. So firstly, can I pick the odd one out? This is really tough. I'll say right now, if I get these right, it'll be interesting. But the differences are really quite tiny between the two. I oddly feel more confident with this set, I feel like I definitely don't like this. If it's the odd one out, will be good. This set is more difficult, which is why it's always good to replicate this. Even one triangle test on its own, isn't good enough. Two is a barest of minimums. There should be three or four or more and more people doing them. No, can't. So, which was the odd one out here? This one, honestly, they taste the same. So this one has no bloom. It tastes indistinguishable from the ones that are bloomed. I can't tell them apart. This, I'll be interested if I got this one wrong. I've got this one right. Interesting, it was a more pronounced difference here. So this is a bloom and I felt more confident about this. And this is the no bloom. I liked this less. It just feels a touch harsher and more extracted. I don't really know why, it just is. From this though, I would say that that blooming doesn't have a staggering impact. If you're steeping for long enough, that's gonna do the work. The infusion is gonna do the work. I'd be shocked, and we'll test it, I'll be shocked if these have much of a difference in their extractions, they all taste really pretty close. Another blind test for me. And this one probably falls under the kind of received wisdom thing for me. It's the topic of, do you press to the hiss or through the hiss on an AeroPress? If you don't know what I'm talking about, maybe you haven't brewed a lot of AeroPresses. Now, many people say, don't keep pressing once you start to hear the hissing noise, once you press the liquid through, don't press that last little bit of air through cause it makes the AeroPress taste worse. I don't know if that's true. So we're gonna find out. We'll do the same thing we did last time, which is four brews, two pairs, same grind setting across both triangle tests and see how I fare, picking out hiss versus no hiss. Now, this is blind as before. I don't know what's what in these bowls. But what I do know that is kind of interesting, is that the yield difference was pretty small between the two. So if you measure the output of liquid weight between hiss and no hiss, you got six grams more with the hiss, right? So six grams more to about 180 grams of liquid. That six grams would have to taste really terrible to truly impact the flavour, surely. Well, maybe it does. Let's find out. Does it make a big difference? Let's say this is the odd one out. And I would say, theoretically, that's the hiss. It's a touch, harsher, really difficult. Again, first set, really super hard. And these are a little cooler. I can't tell the difference here, I just can't. This is a random choice. So if I get it right, which I don't think I will, then know that it's random, that I didn't earn it as a success. I'm going to say you. As the odd one out, but I don't know. Is it right? No, no it's not right, couldn't get it right. Which one is it? It's not you, it's you! So that one was the hiss. And I couldn't tell. Couldn't tell at all. Here, I didn't get it right either. So we can say with some confidence that the hiss, no hiss thing, I don't think it's a thing. It's six grams of liquid that I don't think tastes that bad. I think this is AeroPress superstition. I'd love you to prove me wrong. Let's move on. Now, next up is a topic that you could argue is true of all coffee brewing, but I think it's particularly relevant to the AeroPress. And that's dose and ratio in a way. Now, a lot of people say to brew two cups with AeroPress, what you should do is put twice as much coffee in and then dilute the brew afterwards. What I want to do is a quick experiment to show the impact of changing your dose while keeping the amount of water that you're brewing consistent. How does that impact extraction? So in this brewer I'll put 12 grams, in this one I'll put 18 grams, and in this one I'll put 24 grams, we'll brew three identical brews, 200 grams of water in each one, same brew time, same process, and we'll taste to compare the output. So we've got our three brews done. 12 grams, 18 grams, 24 grams, 200 grams of water each time. This bowl as a result has less liquid in it, because coffee retains water in the brewing process. So having more coffee means less liquid output. Now, having measured them, this has sort of demonstrated a classic principle of coffee brewing and why ratio is so, so, so important. If you change your ratio, you change the dynamics of extraction. This bowl is more extracted than this bowl which is more extracted than this bowl, because there is more water to do the work per gram of coffee. That's the deal. Now, in the AeroPress, it's very common to say double up your dose and dilute it down later. This would make a very different cup once diluted than this. It's a less extracted cup, a less complex cup, a more acidic cup. So you would have to work harder in your extraction to make this work. Not saying it can't be done, but you would need to adapt. So you need to grind, finer, even though it's an immersion brew. And you would need to potentially steep for longer or agitate more, you know, you're going to have to do a bit more work to get the extraction where you want it to be. And this cup tastes nice and clean and balanced. This cup, you can tell, like there's a kicker of intensity and acidity. You know, it's getting close to 2% strength, which in filter coffee is really quite strong. This, as it is right now, undrinkable, really dominant acidities and quite woody flavours coming out of nowhere. Just not a very good brew, fundamentally. And so it's worth bearing in mind, if you're looking to adapt the AeroPress to try and get more liquid out of it, that you are gonna have to totally change your brewing dynamic using the lessons that we're learning here today. So now I need to talk about one of the big branches of the decision tree of AeroPress brewing. And that is the inverted method. The idea with the inverted method is to have the plunger and the base, and you brew with your coffee and water in here. They can't go anywhere, no liquid can drip through. At the end of the brew, put your top on, flip it over onto your cup and you press as normal, pretty simple. Couple of drawbacks. Firstly, you lose some volume in the AeroPress brew. By having the piston on the bottom here, you actually have a smaller brewing chamber. So I'm gonna brew as before, only 200 mls of liquid, but bigger brews just will not work, and often smaller brews are preferred. You need the plunger a decent distance in, because at some point you're gonna flip this thing over. And when you do that, the last thing you want is for this plunger to pop out, because in that process, coffee goes everywhere. It's a hot mess, quite literally. It's the process of agitation that causes a rapid degassing of coffee, that creates a bit of pressure inside here that pops this top off. So it's that motion of turning that often does it. That initial kind of movement, things can go horribly wrong. So do, if you do this, make sure your plunger is reasonably well seated inside the AeroPress. Now, I'm gonna brew three brews here. For reference, we'll do one where we don't do anything. We just put the coffee and water in, see how much goes through, see how badly it damages our extraction. I'm gonna brew a regular method using the sort of plunger, holding a sort of vacuum pressure in the top to stop liquid dripping through. I'm gonna brew an inverted method and see if there's really any benefit to the inverted method. So we've got the three brews here. We've got the nothing at all. We just let it sort of drain through, though not that much went through, that was interesting. We've got the one with the vacuum held on top by the plunger being in, and then we've got the inverted method here. We've pulled the TDS data and it's... let's just say incredibly similar across the board, which is quite surprising. So time for a taste test. Let's do this one, let's do this one kind of blind. So I'm gonna step away. We're gonna mix these up, and we'll see if I have any real preferences or if any of them have big, strong taste differences. So I know. This one is a little bit hollow compared to the first two. It's just lacking a certain something in terms of sweetness. So my guess would be, this would be the one where we just sort of let it drain through and we didn't hold it. That all the water be in contact with all the coffee for as long as possible. These two, more difficult, very similar. I don't have a preference between either of these two personally. I think they're both very good. I'm not sure I can, you know, say inverted tastes better than vacuum in the top or vice versa. Let's find out. This is the N for no, nothing. That was indeed the one I thought it was. That one is I think the inverted. And that one, the vacuum version. I would say I don't taste a benefit in doing the inverted method, that's my sort of summary here. And historically that's why I don't really like the inverted method. I don't think there's really a win there. You added a lot of risk of hurting yourself, making a terrible mess, and you lose some capacity of your brewer. I don't think you gain much in return. And from a, you know, relatively blind tasting, I can't tell them apart. The extraction numbers are pretty much identical. I think it's just an extra step, that's maybe not necessary. Time now for a very interesting topic. And you might've noticed that one of the AeroPress I've been using looks a little bit funny, something strange is inside it. Lemme tell you what's going on. So this plunger, as you can see, has something inside. I asked G\u00e1bor, who makes the Smart Espresso Profiler, if he could adapt the plunger of an AeroPress, and he could. So you can see here, the little mesh in the piston here, and then there's a little tube that connects it to a smart espresso profiler. This will allow me to see, track, record, monitor, control the pressure inside an AeroPress when I'm pressing, which I just think is super cool. So this connects via Bluetooth to my phone, and I will have on my phone a little gauge and also a graph showing me what's going on. Kind of amazing. And why would I wanna know? Why does pressing matter? That is a great question. We know from the world of espresso, that pressure can be good, but pressure can cause problems in the form of channeling. If you have a lot of pressure and you have a weak point in your coffee bed, pressure will exploit that and more liquid will flow through a smaller area, that will taste bad. Now, what we see in Espresso grinding, is that as you increase pressure, your yield kind of increases and your flow increases, and at some point you hit a wall and you get so much channeling that your yield drops, even though you're grinding finer. And so for any grind setting, there'll be a kind of peak pressure before you sort of cause channeling. Now, I don't know if channeling happens in AeroPresses, but I think we should find out. Now, the pressures are much smaller. For a human being to generate a lot of pressure inside an AeroPress is quite difficult. I've really not gotten much past one and a half bars of throwing all my weight on this thing. Let's not brew like that. No one brews like that. We're going to be probably working in the range of maybe half a bar of pressure for a kind of normal pressing of an AeroPress. Now, interestingly, Alan, the inventor of the AeroPress is very against pressing hard. He wants a nice gentle press. He feels that a higher pressure compacts the bed, and that's a problem. I wonder if it causes channeling. He might be right. Is there a limit to how hard we can press? What I'll do first of all, is a series of pretty simple brews. I'll brew at ever increasing pressures to see if we suddenly see a decrease in extraction that might be caused by channeling, but that would give me an idea of how hard might be too hard to press. So I'll do my best. It's quite tricky to do it manually, but I started maybe 0.1 bar kind of 0.3, 0.6, try one bar, see how we do. We use the same grind, same recipe, same everything else. And let's test the results. So we've got our four brews here. Starting over, actually on this side with the sort of gentlest pressure going up and up and up. Now, the reason this isn't blind is because it really can't be blind. If you look at the color of these bowls they're all dramatically different. What's happened here basically, is that the harder we've pressed, the more material has sort of made it through the AeroPress paper. The AeroPress paper is very small, very thin. And I think at certain pressures, you just blow stuff through it. And that's what we see here. A ton of suspended material. It looks like a much lighter brew. It's extraction level is lower. We'll talk about that in a second. But not as low as it looks. So we knew there was suspended material here. We made sure we use these, these little paper filters that sort of filter out particulate before you refract it and give you accurate readings. No point doing a blind tasting, because it's literally can't be blind because the color is so obvious to just show me which bowl is which. Taste-wise, lower pressure: yummy, very nice, I'm very happy with that. Slightly higher pressure, really not much has changed. It's a tiny, tiny bit, maybe more astringent, but confirmation bias, all that kind of stuff. It's not a blind tasting, so don't worry too much. But it's basically a nice cup of coffee. Here, where we got up to a sort of 0.7 bars. I started to press with a bit of force, no, really quite hollow, suddenly really harsh, really no sweetness. This tastes like an uneven brew. And I think that is what's happening at higher pressures. We are not having even extraction through that cake of coffee at the bottom of the puck. Let's try 1.4 bars of pressure at peak. Oh, that is um, that is wildly unpleasant. No sweetness, no clarity, nothing about that is pleasant. That is a terrible, terrible brew of coffee. And in comparison, this is almost heavenly. So I think that the pressure, there's a couple of things. One, the limit of the paper really is quite low, right? Even at sort of 0.3 bars of pressure, you can sort of see a change in the color of the liquid, indicating more stuff is getting through the paper. The question this makes me think about is, you've had this infusion phase. Can you do kind of bed prep, right? Should there be a period of time after you swirl to let the coffee settle down as evenly as possible and sort of prep and neat bed before you press, will that help the taste? So that's a quick experiment I wanna run next, where we're just going to do a regular brew and we'll press with identical pressure, and then we'll after we swirl, we'll let the grounds sort of fall down for maybe 30 seconds and then we'll press. Obviously, we anticipate a slightly increased extraction from the longer contact time. But I would just be pretty interested to see if we feel like there's more evenness in the taste of the brew. So now we have two of the dreaded triangles that are often the undoing of my great ideas. We did tweak this slightly. So with the first brew, we steeped for two and a half minutes to make sure that both brews steeped for the same amount of time, because in the second brew, we steeped for two minutes, swirled, let the bed settle for 30 seconds and then pressed. So they both started pressing at 2:30 to make it even. This bowl over here has more sweetness. It's quite noticeably different. I would say to the other two. That feels less enjoyable. To me that feels like the odd bowl out. This one is the odd one out is B, which would mean I liked it more. And it is the one where you have the settling. So in theory if I'm right, this one should say A. It does not, wrong. So my confidence was half correctly placed and half misplaced. I would say tasting them afterwards is always a kind of a lesson in how easily manipulated your brain is. Like here, I felt like it made a really big difference and it, you know, I picked it quite clearly. Here, it was more subtle. And now I can taste it afterwards. I can taste that it is the odd one out, but I can't otherwise. From my point of view, I probably build it into my technique because I'd rather err on the side of caution and improve things on average than not. A clean cut win would be beautiful, but really we're into the minutia of AeroPress brewing here. And small details are just that, small details. Let's move on to a big detail in AeroPress brewing. Let's talk about temperature. So first test is actually preheating. Now, a lot of people just preheat an AeroPress by pouring some water into the plunger chamber with a paper inside to rinse the paper and do that thing. I want to take it to extreme to see how big the impact is. So this one here is preheating with freshly boiled water, should be fully pre-heated, I'll throw it away in a second, throw in some coffee into both of them, and put the same temperature water in, and we'll see how big of a difference it makes to the brewing liquor, the brewing temperature to have preheat the brewer. So that might be a little bit unexpected. I certainly found that somewhat unexpected. I thought there'd be at least a degree or two difference, but really heat lost is happening out of the top of the brewer. And that's the same whether your brewer is preheated or not. And that speaks to the thermal efficiency of the material of an AeroPress. You know, if you pour hot water into AeroPress and you hold it, it takes really quite a long time for that heat to get to your hand. So it's a very good insulator, which makes sense. So preheating an AeroPress from a brew temperature perspective, not necessary. And you might say, ah, but what about rinsing a paper? We'll come to that. First, I wanna talk more about brew temperature. Because it's a highly discussed highly divisive aspect of AeroPress brewing. Some people really, really believe in the 80 to 85 degrees Celsius thing, others don't, they believe in brewing as hot as possible. We'll use a temperature controlled kettle, load it with different temperatures, and we'll taste our way through and talk about how flavour, in certainly lighter roasts, evolves and changes with brew temperature. So we've got our five bowls going from 75, 80, 85, 90 and boiling point. And this, I've done loads of times in my career as an experiment. I think it's really interesting to do as a taste test. If you have the kit and the time, I would recommend you try it. A couple of tiny points to note that as we went down in temperature, the amount of foam forming in the brew decreased, and it got harder to press, during the pressing portion of each one, you know, temperature does play a role in viscosity. And that probably impacts pressing, not very important, just kind of interesting. Let's talk about taste. Starting down at 75, it's really not bad, it's okay, it's fine. There's not a lot of character or nuance to it, but it's not unpleasant. There's no dominant acidity. There's no real astringency, it's just nice. And as you got to 80, yeah, it gets a bit more of that. You get a little bit more texture, it's very sweet, it's very pleasant, but it's not hugely interesting. What's interesting for me, is that these next two bowls at sort of 85 and 90 get worse. Like I think this is better than this and this is worse than everything so far. And then suddenly at boiling point, certainly with lighter roasts, magical, delicious, complex, nice acidity, you know, tastes well-extracted, it's the best cup here, for me of a lighter roast. The second best cup is here. And that's confusing. I've talked about this phenomenon before. In the espresso series, talking about temperature, we did talk about how espresso at 80 can be surprisingly good, and maybe at 90 kind of isn't, but at 93, 94, 95, much better again, It's a weird phenomena and kind of proof there's no one way to brew coffee. In addition, if I was using darker roasts, I suspect that these temperatures were to do even better. And I might get a peak in there sort of 90 or 95 zone compared to the 75 to 80, but the 80 would do pretty well for kind of everything. It'll do well for darker roast, medium roast and light roast. You just won't get the full range of complexity in your coffee, you'll have a nice cup, but it won't be the best it could be. And searching for the upper end of that brew temperature is gonna give you the best in terms of clarity, complexity, and all of the flavours that you spent your good money on. There's one thing left to talk about. Something we've kind of avoided talking about all day. We touched on it briefly when it came to preheating the brewer, but should you be rinsing your AeroPress papers? This is the last question I wanna answer before I wrap up. So it's could to be another triangle test. I'm going to brew four brews, two with rinsed papers, two without, two sets of triangles. Can I detect a rinsed paper over an unrinsed paper? So our last triangle tasting test of the video, and if I pull this one off, I will be blown away. I'll be very surprised. This is gonna be tricky. These brews are identical except a tiny piece of paper in one case has been rinsed, and the other, it's dry. Let's dive in. On either of these, I don't know. I guess you. This is random at this point. That one... this... I don't know. I don't know. I wasn't right. And I wasn't right. Unsurprisingly, I don't think you can taste the difference between a rinsed and unrinsed paper. This kind of makes sense. The idea that you could taste the difference between a rinsed and an unrinsed paper in an AeroPress is kind of interesting, right? An AeroPress paper weighs about 0.17 grams. It's very small. And if you brew say, 200 mls of liquid with that, your ratio of paper to coffee is really quite low. Now, at the other extreme, you've got like a Chemex paper, which is four and a half grams. And if you brew, say 500 mls of coffee with that, you've actually got 10 times more paper per liter, so to speak in contact, than with an AeroPress. I would say with an AeroPress, it's just an unnecessary additional step, and an unnecessary waste of water and potentially heat energy if you're using hot water to rinse that paper. I'm not saying that's true of papers across the board. I'm just saying with an AeroPress, I'm not sure I see a benefit. I certainly can't taste a benefit. Let's wrap up. So firstly, thank you for joining me on this journey into the AeroPress. This video has been an interesting mix for me of demonstrating kind of principles of brewing and also uncovering some new information and running some kind of fun tests. All of this is of course in service of me creating what I hope will be an ultimate AeroPress technique. What I'm trying to do with the ultimate technique, is not create the most convoluted and complex recipe with thousands of steps. I want to find the opposite, actually. I want to find the neatest, simplest, cleanest way to get you repeatably to a great cup of coffee with an AeroPress, to have that brewer be an enjoyable part of your morning coffee routine. That's the goal. And of course, that's the next video coming up. But it may not have to be the last AeroPress video. There are of course more experiments we could do. There's more questions to ask and answer. Lemme know down in the comments below what else we should look at. What other aspects of AeroPress brewing are worth some exploration? I'm not trying to create the one best technique, I'm trying to offer a great technique, my perfect technique.", "videoID": "jBXm8fCWdo8"}]}
